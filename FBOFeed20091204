<DESC>1 October 2002 the Army mandated use of a group of Blanket Purchase Agreements BPAs for the purchase of office products.  The primary goals of this BPA initiative were to ensure that office product purchases were in compliance with the statutory preferences afforded to products manufactured under the Javis Wagner ODay Act JWOD now known as Ability One and to capture economies of scale.  The purpose of this annoucement is to alert vendors and consortiums of the new procurement of Army BPAs.  Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center Knox intends to procure office products, inks and toners through the issuance of Blanket Purchase Agreements under the GSA Federal Supply Schedules. RFQ availability is estimated December 2008 via Federal Business Opportunities, Army Single Face to Industry and the Fort Knox Contracting web site.  No hard copy quotes will be issued.  All CONUS Army users are now required to purchase office products through the BPAs.  However, Army installations with onsite self service supply store may use this source to obtain Ability One products.  To the maximum extent practicable the BPA purchases must be made through DOD EMALL.  The Army intends to award sufficient BPAs to ensure adequate delivery coverage consistent with the concept of Army wide BPAs, achieve best value for BPA customers, compliance with the Ability One Program.  Vendors should review FED BIZ OPPS, ASFI for future annoucement on the issuance of the RFQ.

<DESC>The IRS intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Tuxera Ltd, Bulevardi 2-4 A, 7th floor, 00120 Helsinki, Finland, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2),  to purchase Tuexera NTFS Linux widget.  Tuxera has signed an intellectual property agreement with Microsoft and is the only company providing an NTFS kernel level driver for the Linux x86 Platform.  The IRS   depends on kernel level NTFS drivers to write to NTFS drives that will be later connected to Windows machines for analysis.  Kernel level NTFS drivers are needed for imaging speed.  Our current NTFS driver no longer works with newer kernels. 

The NTFS kernel level driver from Tuxera is a source code driver (a widget for the Linux kernel) and not software.  There is NO direct user interaction with this purchase product. 

The NTFS kernel level driver product is unique and proprietary.  This kernel lever driver must:  1. perform kernel level NTFS file preallocation, 2. sustain read/writes  70-80MB/s with 10-40% CPU utilization  when writing to standard SATA I/O channel, 3. must include integration into custom Slackware OS with Linux kernel 2.6.27.27 or later, and 4. must include future updates to kernel revisions with future subscriptions.

All responsible sources who can demonstrate that their product matches the NTFS kernel level driver product with similar pricing guidelines; shall submit written responses which shall include (1) price(s), FOB destination; (2) a description of Tuexera NTFS Linux widget offered in sufficient technical detail to show compatibility and permit a technical evaluation; (3) a POC (name and telephone number); (4) GSA Contract Number if applicable; (5) delivery date; (6) business size; and (7) payment terms.  User level drivers will not work and will not be accepted. All companies  must prove they can legally provide the kernel level NTFS driver with Microsofts written permission. Otherwise the code widget will be illegal  to use.  We cannot use illegal licenses for our work. All questions must be submitted in writing.  No facsimile will be accepted.  As a result of analyzing responses to this synopsis of intent, the contracting office may determine that a solicitation will be issued.  If a solicitation is issued no additional synopsis will be published.  Any such solicitation will be issued to the intended schedule vendor and all firms that respond to this synopsis of intent or otherwise request a copy of the solicitation.

<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National 	Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600,Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>RECOVERY- The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source basis for 1,400 Actigraph GT3X Physical Acitivity Monitors with associated cables and software from Actigraph L.L.C., 15 W. Main Street, Pensacola, Florida 32502.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1)  using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to provide accelerometer-based activity monitors for researchers participating in the Biomarker-Based Validation of Diet and Physical Activity Assessment Tools in Existing Cohorts. Accelerometers are an accepted objective measure of physical activity, and are an essential element of the proposed research.  The validation study requires detailed movement information to characterize the physical activity patterns of study participants for comparison with self-reported information and with activity energy expenditure calculated from doubly labeled water and resting metabolic rate measures. The current state of the physical activity field is that the best information would include triaxial acceleration information captured in high resolution (e.g., epoch length of 10 sec or less), step count data, and information about postural position.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide:</p>
<p>1)1400 Actigraph GT3X with expanded memory physical    activity monitors<br />2)8 7-port USB hub with cables<br />3)4 ActiLife Software for device initialization and data download</p>
<p>Salient characteristics of the Actigraph GT3X with expanded memory physical activity monitors include:</p>
<p>1.)Triaxial acceleration information captured in high resolution (which allows evaluation of orientation), <br />2.)Capability for &lt; 10 second epoch length, and sufficient memory and battery for at least 7 days. <br />3.)Step count data<br />4.)Availability of information about postural position</p>
<p>The Actigraph GT3X with expanded memory allows capture and storage of a week of triaxial acceleration data at one second resolution in addition to step count and postural orientation data.  This is necessary to support the precise physical activity measurements required for the research to be supported.  These capabilities are not found in other known physical activity monitors.</p>
<p>The Actigraph GT3X is the only known established monitor that meets the requirements noted above and Actigraph L.L.C. is the only known provider of the monitor and its related software.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office on or before 11:00 AM EST on December 14, 2009.  No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This requirement is set aside 100% for small businesses. These services will be acquired in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer (AE) Act as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6. AE services are required for two (2) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for commissioning services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO), Silver Spring, MD.
<p>One contract will be awarded by the NOAA Western Region Acquisition Division to include the approximate areas of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, as well as other NOAA locations in the Pacific including: America Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, Northern Marianas Islands, Republic of Palau and Wake Island.</p>
<p>One contract will be awarded by the NOAA Eastern Region Acquisition Division to include the approximate areas of Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Virginia, and Washington D.C., including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The purpose of commissioning services is to ensure existing and new facilities are provided with properly designed and energy efficient systems prior to facility acceptance. Additionally commissioning services ensure the staff is provided with proper systems documentation, receive adequate training, and understand proper maintenance procedures. The services sought under this contract include a selected range of Architectural and Engineering (AE) services for commissioning, re-commissioning, and other engineering services to DOC/NOAA building systems. In this context, "systems" refer to systems and equipment to be evaluated or commissioned and will be further defined under each issued Task Order (T.O.). The best qualified firm will be selected to provide commissioning support services in the technical discipline areas of mechanical engineering, including but not limited to, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and controls, plumbing, seawater systems, laboratory fume hood exhaust systems, fire alarm and protection systems; electrical engineering, including but not limited to, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), emergency generator, radio systems, fire and burglar alarm systems; energy efficiency audits; life cycle cost analysis; value engineering; building control and automation systems; lighting systems; building systems; specialty items, including but not limited to voice/data, telecommunications, security, and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV); and environmental engineering, including but not limited to storm water management, site utility studies, Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED) certification, site investigation and analysis. A general knowledge of other technical disciplines (e.g., architectural and geological) could be required to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>NOAA and its Line Offices have ongoing and continuous requirements to commission newly constructed buildings, and to re-commission existing buildings. Before a newly constructed building is accepted by DOC/NOAA, various building systems, in particular its energy systems, such as HVAC, emergency generators, and Automatic Transfer Switches, are commissioned (i.e., tested for functionality, and in the case of HVAC, efficiency is measured, and air flow rates tested and balanced). Typically, a few weeks after a successful commissioning inspection, the building is declared suitable for beneficial occupancy, and DOC/NOAA takes possession of the building. Because new facilities are being added to DOC/NOAA's inventory each year, the demand for commissioning services is required continuously.</p>
<p>Similarly, when an existing building's HVAC system, or its controls are significantly upgraded or replaced, the HVAC system is usually re-commissioned prior to accepting the work as complete.</p>
<p>The Government shall seek the most highly qualified firm. Cost will not be used as an evaluation criteria for offers.</p>
<p>Under the IDIQ contracting scheme mentioned above, the upper limit of the 5 year life of each of the two (2) contracts will be less than $4,500,000.00. The minimum guaranteed amount will be no less than $100,000.00. Each Task Order (T.O.) under this contract will have its own negotiated cost.</p>
<p>The successful offeror must have a sufficient number of personnel knowledgeable and current with the responsibilities of a commissioning agent, as described in the latest LEED standards for New Construction. The successful offeror must have on his staff, and provide resumes for: <br />&bull; At least 2 persons to serve as commissioning agents with expertise in HVAC systems and controls, plumbing, emergency generators, and automatic transfer switches, and demonstrated ability to perform well as an on-site inspector, especially in the role of a commissioning agent;<br />&bull; At least 2 persons to serve as commissioning agent with expertise in electrical systems, lighting systems and controls, telecommunications and alarm systems, and experience serving as a commissioning agent or in support of a commissioning agent;<br />The above personnel should be willing to travel anywhere there are DOC/NOAA facilities, based on project schedules requiring commissioning services. Additional personnel with commissioning experience, and depth of experience of all personnel, shall be taken into account during the selection process.<br />The successful offeror must also have additional staff to provide other areas of expertise as required, including the ability to design and/or replace systems found to be inadequate.<br />This IDIQ contract will be issued for a period of 5 years. During this time, the offeror must continue to provide excellent services.<br />The present IDIQ commissioning contract expires on March 14, 2010. The projected performance period of this acquisition is expected to be May 2010 - May 2015. <br />The successful firm must be able to perform work anywhere within the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and the Caribbean and Pacific Island territories, though it is expected that most work will occur in the region related to their award, as stated above.</p>
<p>The minimum ordering limitation for this contract shall be $10,000.00. The maximum ordering limitation shall be $1,000,000.00 for any single task order in a given calendar year. <br /><br />SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this action are listed below in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>A. Demonstrated knowledge and relevant experience in performing a full range of commissioning services, including examples of specialized experience in the commissioning of newly constructed buildings, conducting energy audits and HVAC studies and related analysis and design, supporting a LEED submittal as a third party commissioning agent, and the re-commissioning of a commercial building after HVAC controls have been replaced.</p>
<p>B. Professional qualifications of the staff to be assigned to this commissioning contract, with emphasis on commissioning experience and professional certifications and licenses for key personnel, including consultants and subcontractor personnel.</p>
<p>C. Recent past performance on Federal Government projects, requiring commissioning services similar to those described in the Scope of Work.</p>
<p>D. Demonstrated capability to provide recommendations and work efficiently and constructively with other AE firms and contractors when deficiencies are discovered.</p>
<p>E. Demonstrated plan and capacity of the firm to manage multiple concurrent projects across the country.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall be required to confirm they satisfy all of the following requirements to be eligible to contract with the Government:</p>
<p>1) Provide evidence of a current Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) record.<br />2) Provide evidence of a current Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record documenting size status and other socioeconomic qualifications.<br />3) Provide evidence of a current "Vets 100" registration.<br />4) Provide evidence of financial responsibility, capacity, and capability to perform the project.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested parties having the capabilities to perform this work shall submit six (6) copies of fully completed Parts I and II of the Standard Form (SF) 330. In block 5 of the SF 330, Part I, include the Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier for the principal firm making the submission.

<DESC>The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is announcing a project under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  NRCS is seeking proposal for A&E Services under Contract Number AG-3A75-C-09-0023.  A Task Order will be issued to Black and VEATCH for independent design review of an ARRA Watershed Rehabilitation project in the state of Oklahoma: Cottonwood Watershed, Site 15.  The NAICS Code for this Task Order is 541330, and the size standard is $4.5 million.  Design review with detail cost proposal from BLACK and VEATCH  is due no later than close of business on December 4th, 2009.  Negotiation procedures will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6.

The Contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described herein:

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDANatural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard.  The Contractor shall assume responsibility, along with the designer, for the functional adequacy and structural soundness of the design, except in those instances where the contractors recommendations are not incorporated into the final design.  The Contractors capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to ensure that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall ensure that the design:  1) addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies, 2) safely and effectively meets the stated objectives, 3) addresses unique site conditions, 4) Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures, and 5) Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.

This requirement is for basic/applied R&D efforts for hydrogen storage and fuel cell system design concepts for operational demonstration.  This endeavor will culminate one or more cost-type contract awards.  The primary performance objective of this effort is to replace the current batteries in the battery powered fleet of Class II forklifts (stock selectors) operated at Defense Distribution Center Warner Robins, Georgia (DDWG) (30 total) with fuel cell powered units.  The overarching objective of this program is to identify, design and complete a 12 month operational demonstration to validate fuel cell power units operationally and to significantly increase the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL's) associated with fuel cell power system designs for DOD forklift applications.  TRL and MRL definitions may be found at: http://akss.dau.mil/dag/GuideBook/IG_c10.5.2.asp and https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=18231 respectively. 
The secondary objective of this effort is to expand and improve the hydrogen infrastructure technologies used to support a fleet of stock selectors and other hydrogen powered equipment operated at DDWG.  The current infrastructure that is being installed at DDWG is based on natural gas reforming at a centralized location at Robins AFB and then subsequently delivering, via mobile refueler, to six locations around the base where hydrogen powered equipment refill operations occur.  Operations conducted utilizing this support infrastructure are limited by refill times when the mobile refueler is present at each of the refill locations.  Proposals are requested to identify alternate solutions that will expand the existing hydrogen refill operational capabilities at select hydrogen refill locations.
The third objective is to compile operational data to further support our ongoing development of the business case surrounding the use of hydrogen fuel cell powered material handling equipment in DOD warehousing operations. 
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration database and have a Defense Contract Audit Agency approved accounting system.  The Government intends to award to the responsible contractor(s) who offer the best value to the Government as described in the evaluation criteria listed in section M of the RFP.  The solicitation will be available on or about 15 JAN 2010 at the following address: http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and/or NECO for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation.  For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.  "No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed".  Interested sources must download from the www site listed. Offer must be submitted in the format specified in the solicitation. Questions should be directed to Ms. Lorna Tribby at telephone 812-854-6021 or email lorna.tribby@navy.mil (preferred method).  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered.  Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<RESPDATE>010710
<ARCHDATE>03082010
<CONTACT>Frances M LeipContracting Officer315-425-4694

<a href="mailto:frances.leip@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for complete design services (investigative services, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services) for Replace domestic water main isolation valves Project 528A7-10-715.The project is to develop a design to replace all the frozen, inoperable, and inaccessible plumbing shut-off valves throughout the Syracuse VA Medical Center.  This will require the replacement of approximately 100 valves ranging in sizes from 1 to 6 in diameter. This design will identify, replace or relocate if necessary all domestic water valves that are currently inaccessible and inoperable along with installing numerous valves as required that will give us the ability to isolate risers, wings, zones, and floors.  Some inaccessible valves replacement will require but are not limited to the relocation and replacement of plumbing lines, duct work, electrical conduit, and masonry block and gypsum walls. Many of the valves were installed over twenty and even fifty years ago and do not operate or operate at best only marginally and unreliably.  This project once complete will greatly enhance the Medical Centers ability to contain and work on our existing domestic water system in specific areas of the hospital without having to shut off large areas of the hospital that should have never been affected by the necessary plumbing work. Of great consideration and one of the largest obstacles the designer must overcome in the replacement of the valves is how this work can be done with minimal impact to the overall operation of the medical center, especially at a time when multiple projects in many different areas of the Hospital will be in construction at the same time.        A.	Investigative services shall include, but not be limited to, the following:1.	Review VA program requirements and project scope to determine the equipment and construction criteria and provide preliminary plans, drawings, and estimates.2.	Prepare measured drawings for area of work.3.	Perform mechanical, electrical, structural, civil, architectural and asbestos abatement investigation of the existing facility as necessary including full on site investigation to verify existing conditions as it pertains to this project.4.	Provide for approval a detailed plan of the proposed concept for replacement of the valves with minimal impact to the medical center.B.	Design services shall include, but not be limited to, providing complete working drawings, specifications, and detailed cost estimates.  Numerous and extensive meetings with various VA employees, in order to fully understand the functional needs, carefully review the space selected for this project, then prepare construction cost estimates, designs and construction contract documents as described herein.  Design services for asbestos abatement, if found to be required at any time during the project shall be included.  Asbestos Monitoring services during construction if required will be required of the A/E.  Additional fees for asbestos design and monitoring will be added to this contract by amendment, if required.  Design services shall include infection control design in order to be in compliance with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) Environment of Care Standards.Short-List Criteria to select the firms for interview will be based on H09 Hospital and Medical Facilities AND P07 Plumbing and Piping Design specialized experience, technical competence, specific experience and qualifications of proposed personnel and consultants along with record of working together as a team, past performance for VA work, geographic location of the firm, success in prescribing the use of recovered materials, waste reduction and energy efficiency, and the inclusion of small business consultants.  Special consideration in the evaluation and selection process will be given to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  Final ranking of interviewed firms will be based on the team proposed for this project, previous VA experience of the team, and specific sprinkler system design experience.The area of consideration is restricted to firms with offices and key personnel to be assigned to the designs located within a 50 mile radius of the Syracuse VA Medical Center as indicated by a mapquest.com driving directions search from prime designer to 800 Irving Ave, Syracuse NY 13210.  Appropriate data for this project must be submitted to the Contracting Officer on Standard Form 330 no later than January 7, 2010 by 2:00PM.  THREE COPIES OF EACH (along with any supplemental information) ARE REQUIRED.  Submissions should emphasize experience on similar projects, the key personnel to be assigned to this project, and specific VA experience. It is anticipated interviews for selection will be conducted the Third  week of January and that a cost proposal from the A/E firm ranked as the most highly qualified will be required to be submitted no later than February 1, 2010. This is not a request for proposals.  NAICS 541330 applies. Construction cost estimate is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

<DESC>VA-69D-09-IB-0119 - Acute Care 6C-5CN RenovationRenovate wards 6C North and South and 5C North in Building 111 to meet current industry and Handbook 7610 patient privacy needs. Each ward (6CNorth and South) would be combined to create one wing of patient care with one centralized nurses' station and a total of six modular nurses' stations. Ward 5CN would be remodeled to create one ward of patient care with one centralized nurses' station and a total of three modular nurses' stations 6C modifications will result in a 30 Med./Surg. beds for the entire wing with accompanying nursing & physician support space and 13 Med./Surg. beds with accompanying nursing & physician support space for the modifications to wing 5CN. This is a total reduction of 9 beds for the acute care wards 6CN&S and 5CN.  There will be (4) semi-private, two bedrooms, and (22) private, single bedrooms, of which (2) private rooms would be isolation rooms, and (2) private rooms would be set up to accommodate ventilator patients patients on 6C and (1) semi-private, two bedrooms, and (11) private, single bedrooms, of which (1) private rooms would be isolation rooms, and (2) private rooms would be set up to accommodate ventilator patients on ward 5CN. Each bedroom on wards 6C and 5CN will have a private bathroom. There will be (2) patient dayrooms on 6C (1) on 5CN, a waiting room, nurses' workroom, physicians' workroom, patient/family consultation room, resident physicians' support room, modular nurses stations, utility rooms, storage rooms, and other miscellaneous support space. Modular Nurses' stations will be strategically located to enable closer patient contact and patient care efficiencies.  The goal of this project is meet the requirements defined by the CARES Report approved February 8, 2002 by the complete renovation of the 1962 design 64-bed inpatient unit on 6C north and south and the 32 bed inpatient unit on 5CN. The project will consolidate beds from wards 6CN&S and 5CN consisting of 4-bed rooms, 3-bed rooms, semi-private rooms, and private rooms, into a 30-bed community standard inpatient unit on 6C and 13 beds on 5CN that provides adequate privacy to reflect sensitivity and respect for the patient's privacy in accordance with Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and Handbook 7610 Standards. This new unit will also ensure that the medical center is able to provide an environment that fosters a positive self-image for the patient and preserves his or her human dignity. The current bedrooms, toilets, and bathrooms, are not ADA accessible or in compliance with Handbook 7610. The semi-private patient bathrooms have 30 inch wide doors and are configured with only 36 inches wide by 60 inches long of space to maneuver around. Renovation of the bathrooms will also provide an atmosphere which is safe and will ensure that articles for grooming and personal hygiene that are appropriate to the patient's age, developmental level, and clinical status are readily available in an area that is aesthetically pleasing. At present the majority of the patients use a six showerhead conjugate shower room/restroom in the area have the same impediments as those in the patient rooms, i.e., raised-lip thresholds, privacy, patient transfer. Renovation of this area will also result in improved air quality and will create a healing patient care environment for our veterans. The existing ward function will be moved to a swing ward during construction  This project will consolidate the beds on three wards 6CN&S and 5CN from 53 medical/surgical beds down to 30 beds on ward 6CN&S and 13 Beds on 5CN.  Currently the patients on 5C are:  Cardiology (11 beds); surgical observation (9 beds); medical observation (1 bed); and Medicine (9 beds) for a total of 30 beds.  Currently the patients on 6C are Medicine (1 bed); CT (3 beds); spinal cord surgery (1 bed); and Surgery (17 beds) for a total of 22 beds. The bedrooms range in size of 120 square feet for a single bedroom to 290 square feet for a four bedroom. There are currently a total of 14 bathrooms for the 52 patients on 5C and 7C. The renovations will greatly improve the patient bed care areas by providing larger more comfortable bedrooms, have private bathrooms adjacent each bedroom, and by eliminating the three and four bedrooms entirely to allow greater privacy and more dignified environment of care.  The new bedroom sizes will range from a private single bedroom at 180 to 210 square feet to a semi-private two bedroom at 290 square feet each with private bath. These more adequately sized patient rooms will accommodate better patient care, comfort, dignity, and educational services. The renovations will also provide workstations for all health care providers that meet ergonomic standards.   The renovations will provide accommodations for new technologies, e.g., wireless network CPRS systems, Pyxis Medication System, etc.    A family consultation area will be designated for patient and family consultations and education. Staff locker space will be reduced substantially to allow for more patient care functions.  Poor air quality, negative pressure rooms for TB isolation, positive pressure rooms for cancer and AIDS patients and shutoff valves for domestic water will also be corrected with this project.  The present bed configuration have no isolation rooms with true negative pressure.  The air quality will be enhanced with new HVAC systems and appropriate isolation systems that are monitored and self regulating to design values. There are a number of Handbook 7610 and ADA deficiencies that will be corrected with this project, such as room size, functional proximities, ADA compliant fixtures, grab bars, ADA compliant showers and baths, permanent overhead patient lift systems, etc finishes in the patient bathrooms is a constant source of complaints from our patients, especially our female patients. There are a number of Handbook 7610 and ADA deficiencies that will be corrected with this project, such as room size, functional proximities, ADA compliant fixtures, grab bars, ADA compliant showers and baths, permanent overhead patient lift systems, etc

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Innovative PartnershipsProgram (IPP) recently established the Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research Program(CRuSR) Office at Ames Research Center (ARC).  NASA recognizes the significantaccomplishments of the commercial reusable suborbital spaceflight industry and iscontemplating two significant procurement actions: 1) A potential procurement of reusablesuborbital spaceflight services, and 2) a solicitation of research investigations thatwill utilize those commercial reusable suborbital spaceflight services. Researchersproposing to fly  investigations on these vehicles will need  information about thepayload environment, flight profile and potential for human participation. In this Request for Information (RFI), the NASA Ames CRuSR Office is requesting technicaland programmatic input to improve the governments understanding of flight opportunitiesto aid potential science investigators in scoping and designing possible futuresuborbital investigations. Responses to this RFI are welcome from all interested parties, especially potentialproviders of suborbital spaceflight services. Suborbital spaceflight service providersshould consider accommodation of flight experiments that address any of the followingresearch disciplines:	Astrophysics	Earth Science	Heliophysics	Planetary Science 	Space Life Science	Microgravity Science	Fundamental Space Biology	Atmospheric Science	Materials Science	Technology Development NASA may also consider funding research in other disciplines in the future.For experiments, it is expected that NASAs on-board payloads may require services suchas power, data handling, telemetry, internal mounting surfaces, external attachments orports, viewing portals, attitude control and pointing, day/night flight opportunities,and flight operations at remote field locations. NASA is aware that all such capabilitiesmay not be available from every provider, but some of these capabilities may be availablefrom each provider. NASA is interested in opportunities for externally-mountedexperiments as well. Early in 2008, NASA issued RFI NNH08DA003L entitled Scientist Participant SuborbitalScience Pilot Program, requesting similar information from the provider community. ThisRFI (NNA10CR001L) includes updated information and provides an additional opportunity forall interested parties to submit information  either new information or an update of aprevious submission.  NASA will use information received in response to this RFI tosupport future NASA Research Announcements (NRAs) that solicit proposals from the scienceand research communities for experiments that address NASAs science goals. It is NASAs intent to solicit reusable suborbital spaceflight services as early as 2010,which would lead to a pilot program of suborbital flight operations after flightopportunities become available. The Agency welcomes input from industry and otherinterested parties on approaches to procuring these services while allowing for continuedprivate capital investment in this emerging market. Information, such as trade secrets and commercial or financial information, provided tothe government on a privileged or confidential basis that, if released, would result incompetitive harm should be identified and marked as Proprietary. Government civilservant employees are subject to the non-disclosure obligations of a felony criminalstatute, the Trade Secrets Act, 18 USC 1905.  NASA will likely provide Proprietaryinformation to its support service contractors who are under an obligation to keepthird-party proprietary information in confidence. By submitting a response to this RFI,the responder is deemed to have consented to release of Proprietary information to suchNASA support service contractors. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.It is anticipated that, following review of the responses to this RFI, NASA may conductfurther market research through two venues: 1) Meetings on-site at ARC with industry andother interested organizations and 2) NASA visits to company sites.  Parties respondingto this RFI should indicate their interest in either or both of these venues.  Requestsfor meetings on-site at ARC should include a proposed agenda and brief description of theinformation that will be presented.  Requests for a site visit by NASA should describethe purpose and what it would accomplish.  All requests for meetings should beaccompanied by compelling programmatic and technical information as requested below.  Requests for meetings and site visits may be ranked or prioritized based on NASAstechnical and programmatic needs, as well as budget and resource constraints.    Requested Information: NASA seeks both programmatic and technical information from the reusable suborbitalspaceflight community to support formulation of participation in the CRuSR Program. NASAunderstands that some of this information may not be readily available at this point intime. However, for scientists to design mission concepts and payloads suitable to thecommercial suborbital environment and flight profile, NASA will benefit by obtaining asmuch information as possible. Ranges and approximations are useful in the absence ofspecific figures and should be clearly noted as such, e.g. 3.2g- 4.6g, based on currentengineering models. The information that NASA seeks includes: Programmatic:  Approximate date of suborbital spaceflight service availability  Development and flight testing timeline and availability of any test flights forpotential payloads, including likely constraints on such payloads (mass, volume, poweravailability or the lack thereof, etc.) Comments on any and all regulatory, airworthiness, or liability constraints in thedevelopment and operation of this service for use by NASA and NASA-sponsored researchers  Approximate cost/price per payload; per seat, if applicable; and per flight  Government/private partnering needs and/or opportunities Technical:  General flight profile information  Launch/landing sites, trajectory description, i.e. altitude profile vs. time includingoptions/constraints for tailoring the flight path, flight environments (e.g.,accelerations, vibrations), microgravity levels/capabilities and exposure time, launchwindows, potential flight rates, day/night launch constraints for flights in the2010-2011 timeframe.  Data rate for telemetry during ascent, coast, and descent phases, if available Payload environment information - Mass/volume availabilities/constraints for PI and/or experiments - Power, communications, data storage capabilities/constraints - Internal experiment mounting capabilities/constraints and potential forexternally-mounted experiments, including attach points available, if any, and theirconstraints on access to space (e.g. exposed to space, in vacuum, indoors)- Fields of view, attitude constraints (pointing accuracy and stability)- Vehicle pointing capabilities and precision - Earth/space viewing capabilities/constraints - Potential for window-mounted experiments - Window material characteristics (e.g., spectral transmission properties from the mid-IRthrough the UV)- Expected cabin working environment - Internal pressure, temperature ranges, lighting. - Thermal constraints- Atmospheric composition and changes over time, especially humidity.- Pressure suit (if any) concept and associated constraints - In-flight seating configuration and restraints  Operations information - Preferred concept of operations for science flights - Integration of science payloads/investigators/flights with other spaceflightparticipants/commercial flights (as applicable) - Expected timeline for investigator request-for-flight through to completion-of-flight - PI and experiment integration plan - Pre-flight training and testing - Launch opportunities (e.g. dates including earliest available, time of day, repeatcadence, etc.) including constraints on specifying launch windows- Launch sites including constraints on setting flight paths (e.g. overflying specificlocations or phenomena)- Standard timeline and requirements/constraints for testing, accommodation, andoperations (e.g. when to deliver instrument, what are required standards for testingbefore it can be accommodated, safety requirements, etc.)- Opportunities for modifications of any standard services, facilities, operations, etc.- Approximate cost for any of the above that is not included in the base cost of "buyinga ride"- Company Point of Contact to acquire additional information- Information requested by NASA for each vendor/platform- Approximate cost for "buying a ride"- Approximate cost for accommodation- Approximate cost for operations- Any other approximate costs to NASA associated with flying a CRuSR experiment Other information that may be pertinent to NASA and the community of potentialresearchers.

<DESC>Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)<br />Consulting Services for System Design and Specialized Data Production
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introduction: This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide select system design and data production services in support of the development of the Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System payment rates for CY 2011. The information from this market research will help CMS plan their acquisition strategy. Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.</p>
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY TO OBTAIN CONTRACTOR SUPPORT SERVICES TO PERFORM THE SAME OR SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE ATTACHED DRAFT SOW. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) MAY OR MAY NOT ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.<br /><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Under &sect;1833(t) of the Social Security Act, CMS is required to update the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) on an annual basis. Among the factors that fall within the scope of that annual review are the Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) payment groups, relative payment weights, the wage and other adjustments made by CMS to take into account changes in medical practice, the addition of new services, and new cost data. The annual update is made on a calendar year basis, through rulemaking and by law must be made public no later than 60 days before implementation at the beginning of the following calendar year.</p>
<p>The OPPS is considered by many inside and outside the government to be the most complex of the various Medicare fee-for-service payment systems. It has characteristics of both a prospective payment system and a fee schedule, but is neither in its entirety. The system is idiosyncratic in numerous respects and requires extensive hands-on experience to understand. Yet, CMS must use this complicated and often cumbersome system to establish payments for tens of millions of outpatient services that are furnished each year to beneficiaries at approximately 5,000 hospitals. The CY 2010 update of OPPS rates was based on information extracted from approximately 140 million claim records and the most recent cost report data submitted to Medicare by those hospitals.</p>
<p>The OPPS proposed and final rules establishing the payment rates from 2000 to 2010 describe the OPPS rate-setting methodology in detail. (See http://www.cms.hhs.gov/HospitalOutpatientPPS/HORD/list.asp#TopOfPage for a list of OPPS proposed and final rules.) Moreover, there is a "claims accounting", an even more detailed description of the data process, provided under the supporting documentation for the proposed and final rules.</p>
<p>Response Information:</p>
<p>In order for CMS to assess a firm's capability, written responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall demonstrate the necessary knowledge, experience and ability to meet the SOW requirements. As such, Capability Statements shall include sufficient detail that clearly demonstrates your ability to provide the following services: <br /><br />1.

<p>3. Replicating key components of the Integrated Outpatient Code Editor (IOCE) and the OPPS Pricer to support modeling budget neutrality calculations. Provide specifics of experience and dates of such experience.</p>
<p>4. Experience producing specialized claims Medicare outpatient hospital data from CMS data systems using nontechnical specifications. Provide specific experience and dates of such experience.</p>
<p>5. Capability, Capacity and willingness to produce data on an "as needed" basis, without a previously known or fixed schedule, including responding to urgent data requests nights, weekends and holidays, except for defined periods of time that are agreed to in advance by the project officer.</p>
<p>6. Experience evaluating nontechnical specifications for work products for the purpose of assisting CMS staff in using the data to achieve their goals. Provide specifics of experience and dates of such experience.</p>
<p>7. Experience with the CMS and other governmental rules and regulations concerning privacy and use of confidential data.&nbsp;<br /><br />Note: Please reference Section C, Requirements/Tasks to be Performed, pages (3-6) of the Draft SOW for further understanding.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
FOR A TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


The Center for Transportation Management (QMCC) of GSA is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to seek information and sources for a commercial software application for transportation management offered as Software as a Service (SaaS).  For the purpose of this RFI, SaaS is defined below.

	Software as a Service (SaaS) includes business application software and other end-user software running on a providers infrastructure and accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a Web browser. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying infrastructure, network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.
	SaaS may include the publishing of bug/defect fixes via patches and updates/upgrades in function and technology to maintain the operability and usability of the software product running on the providers infrastructure. It may also include other support that is included in the fee for using the product in the commercial marketplace.
	Software as a Service is offered in a usage-based model and is billed typically per month for the services used by the consumer.

QMCCs goal is to become the provider of choice for all transportation needs across the Federal Government and create a contemporary world-class portfolio program that consistently meets the needs of the Federal community.  

GSA periodically procures rates from Transportation Service Provider (TSPs) and makes available a transportation management solution (TMS) to all federal civilian agencies for their shipping needs. The end customers are Federal agencies and users from customer agencies who execute the shipments. QMCC seeks to identify a SaaS-based commercial software application for transportation management to support shipment processing of the following programs:  Household Goods (CHAMP), freight (FMP) and small parcels for the Federal agencies. The TMS solution shall provide standard functionality across the all the noted programs:

QMCC seeks to identify one solution to support all of its needs. The anticipated number of shipments for household goods and freight shipments combined are 100,000 per year and 20 million small parcel shipments per year. 

QMCC is focusing on the following key principles:
	Industry best practices
	Ease of use
	Ease of configuration
	Cost effectiveness
	Information security
	Scalability
	Quality assurance
	Implementation schedule

The solution shall provide the following:

1.	Customizeable with GSA standards such as logo, banner, useful links, FAQs and serve as the entry point to the GSA transportation website.
2.	Support additional government specific master data attributes such as business size and type (example: 8(a), woman owned etc., international bonds), agency/bureau, etc.
3.	Support a hierarchical structure of the government agencies and the underlying bureaus and associated users.
4.	Support a self serve registration process for customers and TSPs for gaining access to the system and appropriate workflow for approval of such requests.
5.	Support role based authorization profiles including super users with administrative roles and restriction of user scope to specific set of lanes or agency specific lanes and rates.
6.	Provide a detailed event log for all shipments, capture and store a complete transaction audit trail with user ids.

The tables below list the anticipated requirements for freight (FRT), Household goods (HHG) and small parcels service (SPS). The letter X indicates the requirement is expected to be mandatory for the specific business type.  The last column should be completed by respondents.

<DESC>The Program Support Center (PSC) at the Department of Health and Human Ser-vices (HHS) wants to identify viable small businesses that can perform application-specific support services for distinct enterprise applications maintained by its Enterprise Systems Services (ESS) program. This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. PSC plans to use the results of this market research to in-form its approach for supporting the delivery of the operations and maintenance services it provides for its enterprise human resource systems.

<p>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in New London, CT that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 1,308 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.

The space must be available for occupancy by April 1, 2010.  The delineated area is New London, CT.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

Indicate whether or not quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvement and state the amount, if any;<br />- Date of space availability;<br />- Method of rentable space measurement;<br />- Building ownership information;<br />- Amount of parking available on site and its cost.  Include whether expected rental rates include the cost of the required Government parking, if any;<br />- Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building; and<br />- List of building services provided.</p>

<DESC>Veteran Affairs intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SRI International for Robotic Suture Welding under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Sole source justification has been prepared in support of this acquisition. Firms believing they can provide these services above must provide written notification to the Contracting Officer with supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. All responses received by December 11, 2009 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses should be emailed to the joel.burgess@va.gov .  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN). Firms should identify business size (i.e. small business, other than small business, etc.) in accordance with the size standard for NAICS Code 541712 which is 500 employees. This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.SRI International shall provide personnel, tools, equipment, and facilities to integrate the ultrasonic welder and robotic platform and testing of the integrated system and experimentation on cadaver tissue.  The essential capital equipment required in this effort will be loaned to the project. The ultrasound welding equipment and the robotic platform will be provided by SRI International.Objective: Given the nature of modern warfare, many scenarios exist where immediate access to a surgeon is limited by distance, weather, or the inability to place every type of surgical subspecialist in every remote location. The goal of remote telesurgery on the battlefield has been pursued by many investigators for many years. However, telesurgery for military trauma has remained impractical and cumbersome for very specific reasons, including the inability of robotic systems to rapidly place and secure sutures. The  proposed work will leverage existing technology to deal directly with this limitation in a focused manner---enabling rapid and automated robotic suturing, and advancing telesurgery one step further toward its ultimate role in providing military trauma care.

<p><br />Terms and Conditions</p>
<p>Changed from: <br />fixed price (not to exceed dollar amount) contract for $8,391.20 of<br />supplies for laboratory analyses testing. The start date for the contract is<br />February 2, 2009.

Completion date will be 9/30/2013. Items are to be shipped in<br />partial shipments throughout the term based on phoned in orders against the<br />purchase order.</p>
<p>BPA Originally awarded as sole source to Sigma Aldrich in accordance with <br />FAR 6.302-1<br />The property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency</p>
<p><br />GIPSA'S specific mycotoxin (i.e.,aflatoxin &amp; DON), analysis methods all require the use of Sigma -Aldrich products. Any other supplier/model invalidates the methods, rendering them unable to analyze grain samples for mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are a critical international trade test related to safety/health of grain consumption.</p>
<p>For Standards Needed for Biotechnology (Genetically-Modified) testing, these standards are only available from Sigma-Aldrich to meet the needs of the PCR Validated methods. Biotechnology in grains is a very sensitive trade issue.</p>
<p>For the HLPC pre-blended solvents for use in the Wheat Varietal identification research, research protocols require solvents continue to be obtained from the same vendor for consistency of results from the HPLC. If there was any change in vendor, the preblended solvents may not be the same as the ones made at Sigma Aldrich which then can possibly change the results significantly, especially with a sensitive project. To avoid potential for invalidating months of research, the same vendor needs to be used.</p>

<DESC>The OWL radar provides the ability to detect, track and locate mortar, cannon and rocket firing positions automatically, when fired in a variety of situations.  This includes conventional indirect weapon fires, in addition to, weapons fired with non-standard trajectories.  The system also has the ability to provide the location of weapons fired in mountainous terrain from elevations both above and below the radar.  The OWL provides high-quality track data on mortar, cannon, and rocket targets in order to be fully capable of providing a cue for handoff to fire control systems.  Additionally, the system provides quality impact point prediction with sufficient warning to improve force protection and take responsive measures in a timely manner.  The system also incorporates advanced techniques for system self-protection against Electronic Attack, i.e., jamming and deception.

<DESC>This notice is provided for informational purposes only. This opportunity is only available to the Expedited Research and Demonstration (XRAD) Task Order Contractors (TOCs). These TOCs were competitively awarded in 2006 to six (6) Small Businesses under the procedures of FAR Subpart 16.505, multiple awards, Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity contracts. CMS intends to award a competitive task order to produce person level data files and related information to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) that is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). This effort will develop a research file that incorporates key administrative assessment data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) for nursing facilities, data from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for home health agencies, and selected On-line Survey and Certification Assessment Reporting (OSCAR) data and link it to Medicare and Medicaid administrative data for Medicaid, dual-eligible and private pay patients (MDS beneficiaries only). This file will be known as the Long-Term Care Assessment file (LTC-A). A wide range of beneficiary and provider information will be linked with the MAX system of files and the Medicare Base Summary Files (BASF) from the CMS Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW). CMS believes that this effort will greatly enhance CER studies pertaining to long-term care and post-acute services by compiling this information in one file. The task order is expected to be completed within 3 years after award. The Contracting Officer has determined that the most appropriate contract type is Cost Plus Fixed-Fee.

<DESC>This notice is provided for informational purposes only. This opportunity is only available to the Medicare and Medicaid Research and Demonstration (MRAD) Task Order Contractors (TOCs). These TOCs were competitively awarded in 2005 under the procedures of FAR 16.505, multiple awards, Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity contracts. CMS intends to award a competitive task order to produce person level data files on Medicaid eligibility, service utilization and payment information to support Comparative Effectiveness Research that is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). This effort will allow the continuation of transforming Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) data into Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data which merges Medicaid demographic and claims information as well as converts fiscal year quarters into a calendar year. The purpose of MAX is to organize Medicaid data and make it usable for researchers to support research and policy analysis on Medicaid populations.
<p>In addition to producing MAX data, the contractor will also design, develop, and establish an early release version of MAX ("Beta MAX") so that researchers may obtain Medicaid data more timely for Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). This contract also provides options to continue major activities that enhance MAX data to include:<br />&bull; Social Security Number Verification.<br />&bull; Un-duplicating person level records in the MAX files within and across states. The contractor will continue producing the Medicaid Analytic eXtract Enrollee Master file (MAXEM) and an associated cross-reference file. MAXEM is critical for CER researchers with a standard method to develop and implement longitudinal cohort studies.<br />&bull; MAX survey linkage development and implementation. The National Health Information Survey (NHIS), National Health and Expenditure Survey (NHANES), Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA), National Nursing Home (NNH), Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), and a prototype for Census's American Community survey (ACS) as linked to MAX will provide a valuable and efficient research resource for CER studies;<br />&bull; Production of a Provider Characteristics file. This file will enhance CER researcher capabilities to tie utilization information to those that provide specific services.<br />&bull; Provide contractor technical assistance (TA) to states that operate stand alone Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP) that volunteer to work with CMS to improve Federal CHIP -CER related data reporting for incorporation into MSIS/MAX.<br />&bull; Provide technical assistance (TA) to states that volunteer to improve managed care encounter reporting in MSIS and MAX for use in CER.</p>
<p>The task order is expected to be completed within 3 years after award of the task order. The Contracting Officer has determined that the most appropriate contract type is Cost Plus Fixed-Fee.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, intends to award a sole source procurement to Western Ecosystems Technology, Inc.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Region Seven (7), requires a manuscript and publish results of a study preformed by Dr. Ryan Nielson.
The contractor, West, Inc., completed the simulation analysis to determine the feasibility of obtaining a robust population estimate for Chukchi/Bering seas polar bear population from an icebreaker with helicopter support.  Dr Ryan Nielson prepared a final report summarizing the results of the simulation analysis in November 2008, under previous government contract with USFWS, Investigation of the Properties of an Aerial Line transect Survey for Polar Bears in the Chukchi Sea Using Computer Simulation and the USFWS would like to prepare a manuscript and publish the results in a peer reviewed journal.  Dr Ryan Nielson has been identified as the only source that can provide economical work under the proposed contract because of his extensive experience in this project.  It would be unethical and a breach of intellectual property rights to have someone else take the report without the consent of the principle authors and publish it as their own. 
The manuscript will be written and submitted prior to September 20, 2010.
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the government does not intended to accept proposals received.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<br /></span><em>This effort is being pursued under an existing Agency contract.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Modification 51 is to obligate an additional $200,000 in support of Work Assignment 3-100 which has been previously issued. The period of performance for Work Assignment 3-100 is from April 13, 2009 through March 31, 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of WA 3-100 is to develop tools to assist the EPA's Office of Wastewater Management's (OWM) State Revolving Fund Branch to properly manage and provide oversight for funds provide to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) under the ARRA. The tools to be developed under this work assignment include a checklist to be used by EPA Regional SRF staff to review and monitor ARRA funds provided to CWSRF borrowers to ensure that the funds are being used properly and effectively. The contractor shall also develop guidelines for State SRF programs to monitor and oversee how the federal ARRA funds are being used and to ensure that all federal and State requirements are being followed. The current value of WA 3-100 is $959,460.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>Event  SponsorDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Acquisition and Logistics (OAL), 810 Vermont NW, Washington D.C. 20420DescriptionAnnouncing the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Acquisition & Logistics Supplier Relationship Transformation Webinar.  Wednesday, December 09, 2009 10:00 AM-12:30 PM (GMT-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada).The VA Supplier Relationship Transformation effort is centered on changing the status of VA to that of a "preferred partner" with industry. Initiatives underway include the Supplier Relationship Transformation Web site, an idea submission portal for the VA's greatest challenges, a link for submitting ideas to improve VA acquisition process issues, and future use of the Michigan State University Supplier Perception Survey. These efforts focus on improving VA procurement transparency and maintaining transformation momentum. In August 2009, VA conducted a Supplier Relationship Transformation Forum where the VA Deputy Secretary challenged VA's suppliers to partner with the VA and identify their best ideas to help provide solutions to the challenges of supporting America's Veterans in the 21st century. The Deputy Secretary also invited industry to participate with the VA in the early phases of the procurement process to assist in the development of robust requirements for future VA programs. This webinar, hosted by the VA Office of Acquisition, Logistics, and Construction, provides an opportunity to re-engage those companies, reach out to new companies, provide updates on issues identified at the forum, and outline the process that VA will use to solicit the best ideas of industry to help solve the VA greatest mission challenges.  The webinar registration link is at:  http://event.on24.com/r.htm?e=182053&s=1&k=0062287EBBA73A4817D61B1AD951B99DWe look forward to your participation.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<DESC><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>From the beginning of the Medicare program in 1965, Medicare has recognized the unique nature of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and HMO-like entities and has provided for alternative payment methodologies appropriate for such organizations. The original Medicare amendments to the Social Security Act included the authority for prepaid plans to receive payments for physician services on a basis other than individual charges. Even before the enactment of the federal HMO Act in 1973, the 1972 amendments to the Social Security Act provided authority to contract with HMOs on a risk-sharing basis and on a cost basis.</p>
<p>In 1996, Section 202 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) added section 1893, to the Social Security Act. Section 1893 established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP). MIP was established to strengthen CMS's ability to deter waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. It provides for separate and stable long term funding for MIP activities. MIP expands CMS's contracting authority so the agency can more aggressively carry out program safeguard functions.</p>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) established the Medicare+Choice (M+C) program, allowing additional types of managed care organizations to secure Medicare contracts. A major intent of the BBA was to replace the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) with new managed care options (i.e. M+C plans, etc.) for beneficiaries. It allowed for new beneficiary options in addition to the well established types of HMO options operating under TEFRA contracts.</p>
<p>A major intent of the BBA was to replace TEFRA with a new managed care options (i.e. M+C plans, etc.) for beneficiaries. It allowed for new beneficiary options in addition to the well established types of HMO options operating under TEFRA contracts.</p>
<p>The recently-enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) has expanded the role of private entities in providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. First, the law adds a new section to the Social Security Act, 1860D ("Part D") that offers prescription benefits beginning in 2006 through Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). Secondly, the statute allows for payments to Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) "local plans" formerly M+C plans, and creates a new type of private plan, "Regional" MA plans or Regional Preferred Provider Organizations (RPPOs).<strong><br /><br />Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">CMS anticipates releasing one (1) solicitation for the award of multiple IDIQs for firm fixed price (FFP) task orders (contracts) for the examination engagement to review the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) and/or Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) and/or the Agreed-Upon Procedure (AUPs) review of Cost-Based Medicare Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) on and/or about Tuesday, December 22, 2009. <br /><br /><br /><em>Examination Engagement for Review of Medicare Advantage Organizations and Prescription Drug Plans' Financial Information</em></p>

OFM will conduct annual audits of the financial records of at least one third of the MAOs and PDPs as required by Sections 1857(d)(1) and 1860D-12 of the Social Security Act.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the examinations are to provide assurance that Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug payments were proper and organizations' self reported information used to determine payment amounts were valid and correct. The audit contractor shall document the results of the examination, extrapolate the value of appropriate exceptions to the entire population and propose payment adjustments.</p>
<p>The examination engagements shall be made in accordance with the Uniform Examination Program (UEP) for the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) and Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) which, includes:</p>
<p>&bull; Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB)</p>

<p>&bull; Social Security Act (the Act) Titles XVIII and XIX and; the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) governing the MAO program including, standards and processes for imposing the enforcement provisions.<br /><br /><em>Agreed-Upon Procedure Review of Cost-Based Medicare Managed Care Organizations (MCO) Cost Reports</em></p>
<p>CMS's Office of Financial Management (OFM) has overall responsibility for the fiscal integrity of all Agency programs which include the oversight of cost-based managed care organizations as well as the mandated one-third financial audit requirement. OFM will conduct periodic audits of cost-based managed care organizations in accordance with Section 1876 of the Social Security Act and based on criteria established by CMS.</p>
<p>The objective of the Agreed-Upon Procedure (AUPs) review is to determine whether reimbursable costs claimed by the Managed Care Organization are reasonable, allowable, and allocable in accordance with applicable Medicare laws and regulations.</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor shall evaluate the MCO's Medical Review programs and make recommendations for improvement. The review includes, but is not limited to, the review of the MCO procedures and internal controls over duplicate payments and situations when Medicare is a Secondary Payer (MSP). In addition, the Offeror shall evaluate the accuracy and allowability of Medical Coding (CPT codes) and related Relative Value Units (RVUs) (if applicable) to ensure fair apportionment and the accuracy of the claimed medical services costs. <br /><br />The examination engagements shall be made in accordance with the Agreed Upon Procedures (AUPs) for the Managed Care Organizations (MAOs) which, includes:</p>
<p>&bull; Thorough understanding of Medicare managed care cost reimbursement principles and the required cost reporting formats.</p>
<p>&bull; Thorough understanding of Medicare cost apportionment methodologies and the ability to distinguish administrative and general cost from plan administration costs and their respective allocation and apportionment methodologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&bull; Thorough understanding of the review of medical claims costs and the review of financial information relating to Managed Care Organizations.<br /><br /><br />(End of text)</p>

<p>IV. BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>The objective of the NLRB is to select the offer that represents the best value to the Government while meeting or exceeding the requirements. All evaluation factors and their relative importance are set forth in this solicitation. A pre-award walk through of the facility may be conducted prior to award. The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance. An integrated assessment of quotes using all evaluation factors found in the solicitation will be the basis for award. The award may be made based on the initial submission, without discussion, so contractors should submit proposals that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the SOW and should indicate hotel amenities that support the conference learning experience. All proposals must confirm in their offer that the facility is compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire and Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391)(15 U.S.C. 2201 et.seq.) and the American with Disabilities Act (ADA)(Public Law 101-336)(42 U.S.C. 12101 et.seq.). In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the Online Electronic Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a). Offerors shall submit all information with the offer as required in FAR provision 52.212-1.</p>
<p>The NLRB is a tax exempt entity; please do not include taxes in quotes.<br /><br />To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. A contractor can contact the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or email at http://www.ccr.gov. A DUNS (Dun and Bradstreet) number is required in order to register.</p>
<p><br />V. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The award will be made to the responsible proposal whose offer is evaluated as the best value to the Government based on the factors set forth below. Proposals that exceed the NLRB requirements and provide amenities that support the leadership conference will receive additional consideration under the Technical Capabilities. The evaluation factors are stated in the order of importance. Technical factors are more important than price, but as offers become more equal, price becomes more important, and could be the deciding factor for award. <br />These factors are listed in order of importance: <br /><br />1. Technical Capability<br />The contractor's proposal must provide sufficient information to demonstrate the ability to meet or exceed all the Government's requirements with seamless food and beverage support for the conference and provide a competitive food and beverage menu at conference functions. In addition, the contractor shall provide support services and amenities that facilitate a relaxed learning environment for participants.<br /><br />2. Past Performance<br />The contractor shall provide a list of three recent contracts, with contact phone numbers, that exemplify accomplished activities related to or similar to the activities identified in the SOW.</p>
<p>3. Price<br />The amount, realism, balance, and consistency of the evaluated price are considered. The pricing proposal should provide a Total Quote with a breakdown of price by Sleeping Accommodations, Meeting Rooms, and Food and Beverage service. All other conference costs will be included in the Total Quote and will not need to be broken out by price.</p>
<p>QUOTE SUBMISSION</p>
<p>Quotes are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Quotes should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this Solicitation (See 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items). Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English. Quotes that do not follow this format, or otherwise include documentation that is difficult to read, may be rejected or may result in a lower evaluation rating.</p>

Quotes must indicate whether the hotel agrees to the right of the NLRB to use its own audiovisual equipment if necessary and if there is a cost incurred for connection to hotel sound system or other charges connected to the use of own equipment.</p>

It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above internet site for the solicitation and any amendments. POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS. No collect calls will be accepted.
<p>This project is funded thorough the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the act. <br /><br />It is anticipated this solicitation will result in multiple awards. <br /><br />Awards resulting from this solicitation No. RFQ-NCI-10007-AS will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect at the time of award for commercial items using simplified procedures.</p>
<p>Under this RFQ, the offeror shall provide clinically annotated biospecimens to TCGA for the following cancer types: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Head and neck (oral) squamous cell carcinoma, Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, Uterine Corpus (endometrial carcinoma), Astrocytoma, Cutaneous melanoma, Other Cancer Types Currently Not Identified.</p>
<p>The NCI is expanding its basic and translational research programs that rely heavily on sufficient availability of high quality well annotated biospecimens suitable for use in genomic studies. The NCI's overarching goal with such programs is to improve the ability to diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), one such program, is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies. The NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched TCGA as a 3-year pilot project in 2006, and have since (August 2009) initiated the second phase of the project to study at least 20 additional cancers over 5 years. This project aims to systematically explore the entire spectrum of genomic changes involved in human cancer. Specifically, the project is designed to comprehensively analyze DNA copy number changes, including large (on the order of chromosome segments) and small (1,000-100,000 kb) scale rearrangements, transcription profiles, epigenetic modifications, sequence variation, and sequence in both tumor tissue and case-matched germline DNA. The suite of analysis platforms will be applied to a common set of molecular analytes obtained from clinically annotated high-quality tumor biospecimens and case-matched normal tissue (control). More detailed information can be found at the project's website: http://cancergenome.nih.gov. To successfully generate comprehensive data in phase two, TCGA will need in excess of 40,000 biospecimens over course of the project.</p>

<p>Under this RFQ, the offeror shall provide clinically annotated biospecimens to TCGA for the following cancer types: Glioblastoma multiforme, Lung squamous cell carcinoma, Breast ductal carcinoma, Colon adenocarcinoma, Breast lobular carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma , Stomach adenocarcinoma, and Other Cancer Types Currently Not Identified.</p>
<p>The NCI is expanding its basic and translational research programs that rely heavily on sufficient availability of high quality well annotated biospecimens suitable for use in genomic studies. The NCI's overarching goal with such programs is to improve the ability to diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), one such program, is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies. The NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched TCGA as a 3-year pilot project in 2006, and have since (August 2009) initiated the second phase of the project to study at least 20 additional cancers over 5 years. This project aims to systematically explore the entire spectrum of genomic changes involved in human cancer. Specifically, the project is designed to comprehensively analyze DNA copy number changes, including large (on the order of chromosome segments) and small (1,000-100,000 kb) scale rearrangements, transcription profiles, epigenetic modifications, sequence variation, and sequence in both tumor tissue and case-matched germline DNA. The suite of analysis platforms will be applied to a common set of molecular analytes obtained from clinically annotated high-quality tumor biospecimens and case-matched normal tissue (control). More detailed information can be found at the project's website: http://cancergenome.nih.gov. To successfully generate comprehensive data in phase two, TCGA will need in excess of 40,000 biospecimens over course of the project.</p>

<p>Dockside Repairs of CGC RUSH (WHEC-723)</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-P45C10 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposals incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37. This is a small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that the Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurements, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-P45979 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposals incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37. This is a small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that the Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurements, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.</p>

The following Statement/Information is in reference to this Acquisition being considered to be a Sole Source Acquisition based on the following as provided to the Contracting Officer and hereby agreed upon.  

USCG C2CEN SEAWATCH FRC LAB
SOFTWARE PURCHASE
Justification for other than full and open competition

(a) Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited.  As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information: 

(1)  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity and specific identification of the document as a Justification for other than full and open competition.  U.S. Coast Guard, Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN), Portsmouth, VA

(2)  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  SEAWATCH Fast Response Cutter (FRC) requires three software applications produced by SSR Engineering for use in development of the command and control system. 

(3)  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs.  The SEAWATCH FRC requires three software applications designed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), SSR Engineering.  These software applications include: 
Radar Display Operator Position RDOP Radar Software for Windows (P/N 730)
Camera Manager Software for Solaris (P/n 642-CM4)
Automated Information System (AIS) Parser with Blue Force Tracking Software (P/N 310-BF)

(4)  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 
6.302-1 (2) (ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components there, of when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  This cost is estimated to be $200K.

(5)  A demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.
The use of the Personal Computer Radar Processor (PCRP) from SSR Engineering has been dictated by the FRC Circular of Requirements (COR) and in order to interface properly with this equipment specific software applications are required to operate SEAWATCH.  

(6)  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not which exception under 5.202 applies:  A synopsis is being posted to Fed-BizOps.

(7)  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The OEM of the software has the software on price sheet which is available to the general public.  

(8)  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  Market research reveled other products perform similar functions to the applications required; however, these products would require modification to meet the interface requirements of the PCRP.  The COTS applications designed by SSR Engineering require no modification.  

(9)  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition such as: 
The protocol that the PCRP communicates in is Common Radar Information Communication (COMRIC) which was developed by SSR Engineering.  In order to properly interface with the PCRP, which will be installed on the FRC, requires the use of these 3 particular software applications to bring in radar and track data in order to fulfill Coast Guard requirements.
The applications being procured interface with COMRIC data formats and provide the requirements of SEAWATCH is a seamless effort.  

(10)  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None

(11)  A statement of the actions, if any the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  The hardware requirement in the FRC COR specify the use of a PCRP for radar data and SEAWATCH must interface with this equipment.  The software application must be compatible with the hardware.

(12)  Contracting Officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officers knowledge and belief.  The OEM of the SEAWATCH hardware and software and SSR Engineering.  SSR Engineering holds the proprietary data rights for the equipment and software.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>COCO Alert 08-33: Attachment 1 <br />Notice for Filing Agency Protests <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The following questions and answers are provided:

Q: PMG Demag Power Supply - What are the ratings (voltage, current, watts, etc) and features required for this power supply?  Will a Gauss meter be required?

A: The requirement is an 85 volt AC power supply with 1 volt resolution to provide demagnetizing PMG generators. The control can be accomplished either manually or automatically allowing the operator their choice.  The supplier must provide a safety that scans the PMG output voltage. An excessively high voltage can damage a connected IDG. To avoid this the IDG is prevented from coming on-line unless the monitored output of the PMG fits the prescribed range.

Electrical requirements:
Volts= 0  to 85 VAC with 1 volt resolution 
Current= 10 A max. 
Freq.= 60 Hz. 
Time= 1 second burst 

Q: CSD Governor Demag/Remag Power Supply - What are the ratings (voltage, current, watts, etc) and features required for this power supply? Will a Gauss meter be required?

A: The requirement is a power supply to provide for demag/remag capability for CSD governors.  The power supply must be a DC power supply, which works in conjunction with the PMG demag power supply to provide demag/remag capability for CSD governors. 

Electrical requirements:
		
Volts= 0  to 1600 VDC Open Circuit (unregulated) DC.  It must have reversible polarity (it is not referenced to Ground and is a 'floating' supply).

Current= 1 A max. 
Freq.= DC
Time= 83 milli second burst (5 cycles at 60 Hz)

<p>COCO Alert 08-33: Attachment 1 <br />Notice for Filing Agency Protests <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of quotations is&nbsp;4 September 2009, 4:00 pm, Local Time. PRICES MUST REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 90 DAYS AFTER CLOSING OF SOLICITATION. Quotations may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature, delivery schedule, part number, unit price and extended price; payment terms and any discounts offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; and delivery date and MUST include the required FAR 52.212-3, including Alternate 1, Offeror Representations and Certifications.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned.

*** END OF AMENDMENT 0001 ***

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently planning the release of a final Screening Information Request (SIR) early in the second quarter FY2010 for the modernization of the Alaskan Satellite Telecommunications Infrastructure (ASTI).  The FAA intends to issue a single contract from that SIR requiring the contractor to provide, deliver, integrate, and test ASTI components to include the replacement of the Network Management and Control System (NMCS).  Additional life cycle support services such as ASTI training development and conduct, ASTI technical documentation development, maintenance support, and optional contractor depot logistics support will also be included as part of the scope of the contract.  
In advance of the final SIR release the FAA is posting this draft SIR for Industry information and comment.  The documents contained in this announcement are a result of the FAA's consideration of Industry comments received on the draft documentation posted in March 2009. 
The FAA is requesting potential offerors who are interested in pursuing this opportunity in a prime contractor capacity to submit a notice of intent to the contracting officer listed below.  A notice of intent is requested whether or not comments to the draft SIR are provided to the FAA.

 "FAA and Small Business:  Moving Into the Next Generation"
VIEW THE CONFERENCE AGENDA HIGHLIGHTS BELOW. 
The Annual FAA National Small Business Procurement Opportunities Training Conference and Trade Show will be hosted, June 28 - July 1, 2010, at the Renaissance Oklahoma City Convention Center Hotel located at 10 N. Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK  73102.  The forum will provide small businesses knowledge on how to contract with the FAA, marketing strategies, and give important information on procurement opportunities such as NextGen, eFAST, ERAM, NISC, power systems, terminal field operational support, engineering development services, safety and operations support, communications flight service and weather engineering, technology transfer, airport and aircraft safety R&D, quality standards, organizational effectiveness, research partnerships, operational support, security guard services (Federal Protective Service contracts consolidation), construction, airport modernization (MassPort Authority), information technology support services, management services, technical support services, engineering services, facilities infrastructure and security services, environmental services, telecommunications services, major system and subsystem manufacturing, architectural and training services etc. 
The FAA annually obligates more than $3 billion in goods and services (over $1 billion a year in support services awarded to small businesses.)  In Fiscal Year 2009, the FAA awarded 29% of the total procurement dollars to small businesses, 12% to 8(a) certified firms, 12% to small disadvantaged businesses, 5% to women-owned businesses and 2.2% to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  In Fiscal Year 2010 (for the period beginning 10/1/09 - 11/24/09), the FAA awarded 28% to small businesses, 10% to small disadvantaged businesses, 4% to women-owned businesses, and 2% to service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. 
The FAA continues to aggressively reach out to the nation's small businesses by conducting technical panel sessions and procurement opportunity workshops that are specifically focused on awarding prime contracts and subcontracts to small businesses.  Workshop sessions will address technical program requirements and business issues as well as provide detailed procurement information that will help increase small business opportunities with the FAA. 
Small businesses are encouraged to market their capabilities during the forums with large primes, FAA technical and procurement subject matter experts, and by participating in the Exhibit Hall Trade Show.  Large businesses with major FAA contracts will also be on-hand to provide specific subcontracting opportunities and conduct industry subcontracting/mentor-protg workshops.

<DESC>For Pay Items 1 & 2, the signs and markers are to be placed on numerous forest roads throughout the forest.  500,000 acres (780 square mile area)  Maps of specific roads will be provided to the contractor upon award.  Contractors can go to our website (http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/allegheny/) and click on the link for our Motor Vehicle Use Map.  

For Pay Item 4, the large portal signs are 96" x 48"

For Pay Item 5, every site will be different.  Some sites will need a new sign.  Other sites may need a new post as well.  U-Channel sign posts will be provided by the Forest Service.

The concrete (Sakrete) for the wooden sign posts shall be provided by the contractor

Flexible markers will require only one person to drive in the marker.  Horizontal markers will use a wooden post and will probably need two people to set the post with Sakrete.
The large portal signs will need at least two people to set the posts and bolt the sign panel to them.  The large portal signs are along state road ways, so you may need a flagger for those.  Not required though.  Other road signs can be done with either one or two people.

Some of the GFE will be available at the beginning of the contract.  We will have some flexible markers available.  The signs are in the procurement process right now, and we do not know when they will be coming in.  Notice to Proceed may not be issued until all the signs and equipment are available to the contractor.  It should be by the beginning of spring.

The resulting contract will be a performance-based service contract; therefore, the wage rates are the DOL rates for the area of performance.  No bonding is required.

<DESC>The System F-6 program seeks to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a satellite architecture wherein the functionality of a traditional "monolithic" spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules. Each such "fractionated" module would contribute a unique capability, e.g., computation and data handling, communications relay, guidance and navigation, payload sensing, etc., or it could replicate the capability of another module. The fractionated modules would fly in a loose, proximate cluster orbit or potentially self-assemble into an aggregate system. Critical to this architecture is a robust, system-level approach to ensuring security, integrity, and availability, while implementing authentication and non-repudiation. The modules create a virtual satellite, delivering a comparable mission capability to a monolithic spacecraft, while significantly enhancing functional and programmatic flexibility and robustness, reducing risk through the mission life and spacecraft development cycle, and enabling incremental deployment of the system. The System F-6 architecture is designed to provide valuable options to decision makers throughout the life cycle development of future space systems that are absent in present-day monolithic architectures.
<p>The contract type is cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion.) A fixed price contract is only appropriate when the risk involved can be predicted with an acceptable degree of certainty. However, for this research and development effort, the conditions described at FAR 16.301-2 are present. Uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract. There is not any reasonable basis for firm pricing. Therefore, use of a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is appropriate for Phase 2 of the System F6 program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Phase 1 of the System F6 program was awarded on a competitive basis.&nbsp; The follow-on Phase 2 effort was awarded without full and open competition.&nbsp; See the attached Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition for a detailed rationale of the decision not to compete.</p>

This opportunity was available only to the Del-Jen, Inc under contract number DOLJ07UA00016.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps intends to award a modification in the amount of $59,061 to the Gainesville Job Corps Center, operated by Del-Jen, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceiling for Equipment on this contract.

These funds may be used for all expenses related to the acquisition of electric vehicles, including purchase of vehicles, shipping and delivery costs, training on use of vehicle, and additional equipment such as batteries and supplies. In addition, Job Corps centers with automotive career technical training (CTT) programs will use this opportunity to acquire electric hybrid vehicles as student training aids, to provide hands-on technical training in green vehicle technologies.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO EPA CONTRACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY AWARDED TBA CONTRACTS
<p>The purpose of this notice to announce the award of Task Order #0011 to ARGO Systems, LLC (EP-W-07-094) from the Targeted Brownfields Assessments (TBA) Contracts Request For Offer # 37 and to obligate funding in the amount of $339,224.53. The period of performance will be from December 4, 2009 through May 31, 2010.</p>
<p>This requirement shall entail contractor performance of a phase II and phase III Environmental Site Assessment (ESA). In planning this phase II ESA, the contractor shall utilize information from all previously completed investigations and cleanups. The general objective of the phase II ESA is to perform all characterization efforts (including collection/analysis of environmental samples, evaluation of results and preparation of a report) necessary to determine the nature/extent of any additional cleanup efforts required through the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP). The phase III ESA shall be conducted for the purposes of evaluating cleanup options and preparing cost estimates based on phase II ESA findings and redevelopment plans. The NTCB property occupies approximately 1185 acres near the Town of Port Deposit, Maryland in Cecil County.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization (OBLR) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OBLR contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OBLR contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>The System F-6 program seeks to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a satellite architecture wherein the functionality of a traditional "monolithic" spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules. Each such "fractionated" module would contribute a unique capability, e.g., computation and data handling, communications relay, guidance and navigation, payload sensing, etc., or it could replicate the capability of another module. The fractionated modules would fly in a loose, proximate cluster orbit or potentially self-assemble into an aggregate system. Critical to this architecture is a robust, system-level approach to ensuring security, integrity, and availability, while implementing authentication and non-repudiation. The modules create a virtual satellite, delivering a comparable mission capability to a monolithic spacecraft, while significantly enhancing functional and programmatic flexibility and robustness, reducing risk through the mission life and spacecraft development cycle, and enabling incremental deployment of the system. The System F-6 architecture is designed to provide valuable options to decision makers throughout the life cycle development of future space systems that are absent in present-day monolithic architectures.
