<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding five separate one year cost reimbursement contracts with each contract having four option years.   The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is interested in highly experienced organizations for the five regional Centers for the Application for Prevention Technologies or CAPTs.  The CAPTs are SAMHSA/CSAP’s primary knowledge application and capacity expansion program supporting CSAP’s mission to bring effective substance abuse prevention to every community. As such, the CAPTs form the cornerstone of CSAP’s efforts to move science into services. Under the guidance of CSAP, the CAPTs work to expand the capacity of the substance abuse prevention field through the application of effective evidence/science-based programs, practices, and policies within every State prevention service system and community. To accomplish this, the CAPTs provide their clients with timely and effective technical assistance, training, dissemination, and communication services that increase the transfer and application of substance abuse prevention knowledge and skills.

The overall CAPT program goals are to:
1) Serve as one of SAMHSA/CSAP’s major resource for expanding capacity, increasing effectiveness, and strengthening the performance accountability of substance abuse prevention services at both the State and community levels. 2) Disseminate effective evidence/science-based substance abuse prevention programs, practices, and policies so that they can be applied successfully within the diverse contexts of life within U.S. communities, States, Tribes, and other US Jurisdictions. 3) Provide effective technical assistance and training that expand the capacity of States and communities to implement effective substance abuse prevention services.  Such training and technical assistance is coordinated with the ongoing work of SAMHSA’s other dissemination efforts.

Furthermore the CAPT’s are to:
1. Provide state of the art substance abuse prevention training and technical assistance to States to build infrastructure and community capacity to adapt and implement effective substance abuse prevention programs.
2. Provide services in accord with the program policies of SAMHSA/CSAP.
3.  Inform the Project Officers of any publication based on the contract project. Additionally, the offeror must also ensure consistency with relevant CSAP and SAMHSA editorial guidelines and policies (e.g., use of logos, text, format, and related production qualities) before disseminating any CAPT product. It must also comply with Title IV, Sec. 711 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that applies when developing promotional public service announcements.
4. The CAPTs have collaborated to establish a cross-CAPT evaluation plan assuring comparability of data and reporting. There are five Web-enabled databases: Event, Systemic Outcomes, Technical Assistance (TA), Products, and Success Stories. Each CAPT is expected to help shape and maintain these databases. The databases are accessed via the national CAPTUS website.
5. Provide information needed by SAMHSA to comply with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) reporting requirements. GPRA mandates accountability and performance-based management by Federal agencies, focusing on results or outcomes in evaluating the effectiveness of Federal activities and on measuring progress toward achieving national goals and objectives.  The offerors must comply with GPRA data collection and reporting requirements. A description of the CAPTs’ evaluation procedures and measures (including those pending as GPRA and performance measures) will be presented in the RFP. The final CAPT GPRA and performance measures for the program have not yet been determined, and SAMHSA will be working with the offerors to finalize them and obtain necessary clearances once the contract awards have been made.
6.  Provide the following types of reports.
·	Quarterly progress reports
·	Annual progress and fiscal reports
·	Final summary report at the end of the third year cycle.
·	Periodic delivery of electronic copies of contact and service data to the contractor providing data coordination of the cross-CAPT databases.
Additional reports may be required on special projects and activities (e.g., collaborative services delivered with supplemental funding by another Federal agency partnering with SAMHSA in this program). 
7.The offeror must have existing knowledge and experience working with states to support capacity development activities.
8.The offeror must have a working knowledge of CSAP and SAMHSA policy and programmatic initiatives.
9. The offeror must be located within the region they would serve and have been providing technical assistance and training for a minimum of two years in order to show they have established relationships with States and communities.

The CAPT-National Prevention Network (NPN) regions are listed below with the States. 
	CENTRAL REGION: North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin Illinois, 
	Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Michigan, Red Lake Chippewa Band
	NORTHEAST REGION: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,

<RESPDATE>070903
<ARCHDATE>08082003
<CONTACT>Steve Sigler
<DESC>Headquarters Standard Systems Group (HQ SSG) is pleased to announce Block 4 of the Information Technology Tools (IT2) Program.  The first requirement is for Systems Accessories and Rugged Devices, which is limited to small business only.  Our strategic partnership with industry has enabled us to continue our long-standing commitment to provide innovative, flexible, and streamlined Information Technology (IT) acquisition vehicles, which satisfy Air Force (AF) requirements using quality vendors who offer leading market products, reduced cycle times and costs, promote small business goals and opportunities, as well as AF standardization and interoperability goals.  Your company is invited to compete for a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) under a mini-umbrella concept streamlining strategy for the Supplier Market Categories (SMCs) of System Accessories and Rugged Devices.  Interested small business vendors meeting the eligibility criteria may propose in one or both of the categories of either Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or Reseller.  Historically, past source selections for these SMCs required an “all or nothing” proposal response.  In this competition, it is not our intent to force small business to provide products/services outside of their core competencies.  For the System Accessories SMC, an offeror may submit a proposal on a single product category within the SMC, more than one product category within the SMC, or all nine of the product categories within the SMC.  For the Rugged Devices SMC, an offeror may submit a proposal on a single product, more than one product, or all 22 products listed in the Rugged Devices SMC.  For the Rugged Devices SMC, small businesses are encouraged to form teaming arrangements to meet a greater breadth of the 22 identified product requirements, which will be considered as part of the best value determination. System Accessories:  This SMC is intended to meet recurring requirements for products to upgrade existing systems.  The Government seeks companies whose core business is OEM or Reseller of the products in the System Accessories category to meet existing and future requirements.  “System Accessories” encompasses the following nine product categories:  (1) Storage, (2) Monitors, (3) Memory, (4) Computer Components, (5) Network Accessories, (6) Handhelds, (7) Peripherals, (8) Power Supply, and (9) Shipping Cases. Rugged Devices:  For this SMC, the Government seeks companies whose core business is OEM or Reseller of 22 products in the Rugged Devices SMC to meet existing and future requirements.  "Rugged Devices" are defined as portable computing devices that have been designed to withstand drops, water/moisture, heat, cold, shock, and/or dust.  The category includes products that have been MIL-STD certified, as well as products that have not been MIL-STD certified. HQ SSG will make a best value analysis to determine which response(s) will result in the issuance of a BPA(s).  This is not a formal solicitation under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 or Part 13, Simplified Acquisition, but an invitation to compete for a BPA under the terms and conditions of your General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4. The Government reserves the right to issue one or more BPAs, or no BPA(s) at all, depending on the quality of responses and a best value analysis.  The BPA(s) will be in effect for one year from opening of ordering by the HQ SSG/PK Contracting Officer (CO), and depending on prevailing policy and performance of the BPA holder(s), the Government reserves the right to modify the BPA term to allow for bilateral extensions of 12 months, provided your GSA FSS contract remains in effect.  The total length of this agreement will not exceed 36 months.  The Government estimates, but does not guarantee, that the total volume of purchases through the BPA(s) may have an aggregate value of $233M (including extensions).  There is no guaranteed minimum and the Government shall only be obligated to the extent of purchases. Responses will be evaluated to determine which company response(s) represent(s) the best value to the Government as explained in the Best Value Plan (Attachment 7).  It is the Government’s desire to establish BPA(s) with suppliers who have demonstrated strong past performance, offered quality products at significantly discounted prices, established abilities in supplying customer requirements, provided worldwide delivery, and successfully managed worldwide warranty support.  BPA(s) may be entered into after completion of a best value analysis.  The Government reserves the right to issue BPA(s) for single products, a combination of products, or all of the products proposed. For the System Accessories SMC, offerors may propose on a single product category, more than one product category, or all nine product categories as specified in the Pricing Workbooks (Attachment 4).  For the Rugged Devices SMC, offerors may propose on a single product, more than one product, or all 22 products specified in the Pricing Workbooks.  Only one solution for each item listed in the Pricing Workbooks (Attachment 4) is permitted. 	The BPA is at Attachment 1.  It includes Tabs A, B, C, and Standard Form (SF) 1449.  An individual authorized to legally bind your company must sign the signature block located at the end of the BPA.  Tab A contains the Approved Products List (APL), which is a consolidation of Attachment 4.  Tab B contains the Delivery Order Status Report (DOSR) required by the BPA.  Tab C contains the Customer Usage Fee Check Report (CCR) required for this BPA.  Tab D contains the Standard Form (SF) 1449. Submit only one response to this BPA Invitation, which should be divided into separate sections if proposing for both System Accessories and Rugged Devices SMCs.  The response should include Items a-h below.  Deliver two hard copies of entire response to Kay Walker, HQ SSG/PK (Attn:  Kay Walker, 501 East Moore Drive, Suite 1100G (Building 884), MAFB-Gunter Annex, AL  36114.  Include one electronic version of all documents (Microsoft Word 2000 format or Microsoft Excel 2000 format) using the prescribed naming conventions below on a CD.  Your response is due by 1200 PM CDST hours on Wednesday, 9 Jul 03.  Incomplete submissions or proposals received after this date and time are ineligible for award.  All information received will be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure, in accordance with Federal Law.  Please ensure any sensitive information is clearly marked as such.  a.	Signed Attachment 1, BPA (including Tabs A-C and SF 1449 Blocks 2, 17a, 30a-c) (your company name_BPA.doc). b.	Completed Attachment 2, Questions and Answers (your company name_QA.doc). c.	Completed Attachment 3, Guaranteed Future Minimum Discounts (your company name_Discounts.doc).  Offerors shall delineate by category and OEM the guaranteed future minimum discount offered off of the GSA list price for the products proposed using the chart provided. d.	Completed Attachment 4, Pricing Workbooks (your company name_Storage.xls, your company name_Rugged Handheld.xls, etc.).  The Product Configuration Spreadsheets in these workbooks are not to be altered except when adding information requested in this paragraph.  Under the “Proposed Configuration” column, enter the configuration of your proposed product for each “Desired Configuration.”  If the “Desired Configuration” says “specify,” then annotate the appropriate answer (“yes,” “no,” or a very short description) according to the characteristics of your proposed product.  Additionally, offerors shall break out any products and other items/related services that they wish to offer on this BPA which fall in the categories listed previously; by product category and then by manufacturer using the pricing workbooks provided. e.	Completed Attachment 5, Past Performance Worksheet (your company name_PP.doc).  Return the completed Past Performance Worksheet to enable us to keep track of the Past Performance Questionnaires (Attachment 6) that we should expect to receive.  It is your RESPONSIBILITY to ensure that the Government receives approximately five Past Performance Questionnaires from different, RELEVANT CONTRACTUAL VEHICLES.  All questionnaires must be sent to kay.walker@gunter.af.mil or faxed to (334)416-1126 DIRECTLY from the references provided, NLT 1200 CDST, Wednesday, 9 Jul 03. f.	If desired, a two-page single-sided executive summary may be submitted, but do not include technical literature or attachments (your company name_ES.doc). g.	A copy of the Terms and Conditions of your GSA contract(s).  All products proposed must currently exist on your GSA FSS contract.  Clear evidence of this can be demonstrated by providing a copy of your GSA catalog(s), or the APL directly out of the GSA contract(s) highlighting the items proposed (your company name_FSS.doc/xls).  Include the name and phone number of your GSA Point(s) of Contact. It is required that you highlight the items proposed. h.	Completed Attachment 10, your Company’s Points of Contact (your company name_POC.doc). YOU MUST SUPPLY EVIDENCE THAT THE PROPOSED PRODUCTS ARE ON YOUR GSA FSS AT THE TIME OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. INCOMPLETE SUBMISSIONS OR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY RESULT IN YOUR RESPONSE BEING ELIMINATED FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION. Mistakes may be corrected by the CO prior to BPA issuance if:  (1) an offeror requests permission to correct a mistake, (2) clear, convincing evidence establishes both the existence of the mistake and what the response actually intended, and (3) the correction will not result in displacing one or more lower offers (such a correction shall not be made unless the existence of the mistake and the response actually intended are ascertainable substantially from the invitation and the response itself).  Pricing errors discovered post BPA issuance will be handled as a mistake in your response in accordance with FAR 14.407-4, and may result in termination of the BPA if the corrected price significantly exceeds the original submission price. All questions and clarifications regarding the invite package shall be submitted via e-mail until 1200 CDST, Wednesday, 9 Jul 03.  Please ensure that there is no proprietary information in your question, since we intend to make the questions and answers available to all potential offerors via http://web1.ssg.gunter.af.mil/pk/bizops.  If you have any questions, contact me at (334)416-1781 or via e-mail at kay.walker@gunter.af.mil.  The fax number is (334)416-1126.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) intends to negotiate solely with bioMerieux, Inc. located at 595 Anglum Road, Hazelwood, Missouri 63042-2320 to obtain four (4) VIDAS Test Systems.  The VIDAS system was selected for adaptation by FSIS based on evaluations in FSIS and the use of the system by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Agency (FSIS) has committed to using the VIDAS test system for certain food bio-threat agent testing in response to an inter-agency effort to harmonize food bio-threat agent testing methodologies wherever possible.  These particular bio-threat agent tests, evaluated by FSIS and used by FDA, can only be used in the VIDAS system instruments, supplied by bioMerieux, Inc.  The ability to respond to a national crisis situation involving bio-threat agents as adulterants in meat, poultry, or egg products is critical to the Agency mission and bio-threat agent response capabilities. It is critical that products that have already been implicated by risk analyses and testing be evaluated in field studies ASAP using the VIDAS system to maintain Agency credibility and improved testing capability. Literature reviews, internet searches, and contacting industry representatives and scientific experts were performed to identify alternatives for testing food samples for the bio-threat agent of interest.  The VIDAS test system was chosen based on expert advice, available scientific literature, and scientific evaluations, as well as its compatibility with FDA methods.  This is not a request for quotation or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of this solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received.  All interested parties must respond within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice.  Written responses must provide clear and concise documentation indicating your firms capability to provide the system detailed in this announcement.  Verbal responses will not be accepted or considered.  When responding to this announcement respondents should refer to FSIS-33-B-03.  If after June 27, 2003, no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement, FSIS shall negotiate solely with bioMerieux, Inc.  IMPORTANT: Written inquiries should be addressed to Megan Robey who can be reached by email: megan.robey@usda.gov , regular mail: 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Maildrop 5230 Location 2-L188B, Beltsville, MD  20705-5230, by facsimile 301-504-4276, and by telephone 301-504-3989.

<ARCHDATE>06122004
<CONTACT>Marvin Newman Contracting Officer 7183383415     marvin_newman@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS), Gateway National Recreation Area intends to negotiate and award a contract with only one source. We intend to contract with Aztec Development Co Inc, 1331 W Central Blvd, Orlando, FL   32805. The proposed procurement is for a marsh restoration feasibility study.  The Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge at Gateway National Recreation Area located in Brooklyn and Queens, New York has experienced sea level rise, erosion, and degradation of wetlands.  A study will be conducted to ameliorate these impacts.  One method to increase the acreage of wetlands is to increase the elevation of the existing marsh.  To do this in very shallow layer will take a specialized piece of equipment as well as actual experience. The Contractor with the specialized equipment necessary to meet our requirements and specifications, along with the expertise is Aztec Development Corp.  Aztec has been performing this type of operation for a number of years.  While any dredger could pump dredged material into the air it takes expertise to apply this method in a safe and environmentally acceptable manner.  The aerial or jet spraying of the slurry, which should be thin and lateral, permits the build up of material into the area receiving the sediment.  This must be controlled accurately and must be fine tuned in the field.  Aztec has that experience and the equipment.  Their patent on a high-pressure nozzle allows for a fine mist of material to be distributed over a wide area.  Other dredges cannot perform like that.  In addition the nozzle needs to be adjustable to allow for pressure changes and fine tune application into a marsh.  The apparatus needed to build up a wide area needs to be mobile and able to enter extremely shallow (2-3 feet) areas.  The Aztec dredge system can do this and the nozzle end can also be mounded at a distance from the dredge to allow for a larger area of coverage.  This will still allow the slurry to be accurately regulated and controlled.  Also, the equipment may need to be transferred to a remote site accessible only by road.  The Aztec equipment can be mounted on a vehicle that is translated over the area by a cable system that may be hydraulically powered utilizing the pressure of the pumped slurry.  The project is a demonstration as to whether it is feasible for equipment to maneuver around in Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge at Gateway National Recreation Area and be able to accurately jet spray to reach strict elevations without causing additional erosion to the existing marsh. At present there are 3 areas that will be used as a demonstration that needs accurate thin layering.  The National Park Service in consultation with the USACE in the Baltimore District who recently implemented a similar pilot project at the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Dorchester, MD is only aware of Aztec as the company that has the equipment and expertise to conduct this demonstration.  The demonstration is needed to occur between June and early August of year 2003.  National Park Service believes there is only one responsible source and have found no other manufacturer will satisfy the agency's requirement listed above. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes. Firms believing they can provide the required item are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer. They must, however, provide supporting evidence they can furnish the requested item at a cost that will not exceed the total transaction cost, will not violate any patents, and submit a quote for consideration no later than 15 days from the published date of this synopsis announcement. NAICS code is 237990. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquires will only be accepted by fax at (718) 338-3560 or email to Marvin_Newman@NPS.gov.

The supplies and services herein are being procured under the simplified procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.   REB investigators have begun planning efforts to undertake a comprehensive case-cohort study of non-melanoma skin cancer among the U.S. Radiologic Technologists.  This study will evaluate risks and dose-response effects for ionizing radiation exposure, ultraviolet radiation exposure from the sun, constitutional factors (such as hair color, eye color, and skin color), and genetic factors in the etiology of non-melanoma skin cancer.  A series of pilot studies are being carried out to provide important information for developing the study protocol.  The objectives of this procurement are to obtain information useful for developing the study instrument appropriate for the predominantly female, occupational cohort, and to assess possible   interaction between UV and ionizing radiation on non-melanoma skin cancer risk.  Period of Performance: upon award through 12 months. FAR Clause  52.217-8 Option to Extend Service (Nov. 1999) applies.   Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, the Case-Control Study of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer, is the only source known to the NCI that is the only population-based epidemiologic study that has collected extensive information on UV exposure, both from a personal interview and skin biopsy specimens, and where the reliability of questionnaire data was evaluated.  It is also among the few studies with adequate statistical power to examine the possible interaction between UV and ionizing radiation exposures.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any 
interested party believes it can meet the above requirements they may submit a statement of capabilities.   The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM, EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on June, 30, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI).  Submit offers on NOI3058.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-14.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business concern (NAICS-423450). The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure a DNA Engine Opticon 2 Continuous Fluorescence Detection System that utilizes a thermoelectric Peltier-Joule heat module pump that must be compatible with two identical thermal cyclers currently present in the laboratory. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with M J Research, Inc., using simplified acquisition procedures to purchase the following items: (1) DNA Engine Thermal Cycler Chassis- qty 1,  (2) 96-well Alpha unit, holds one 96-well plate or 96 x 0.2 ml tubes- qty 1, (3) Service, fee for mating and Opticon 2 detector with a new DNA engine thermal cycler and a new 96-well Alpha unit – qty 1, (4) Opticon 2 continuous fluorescence detector – qty 1, (5) computer – windows XP operating system – qty 1, (6) opticon 15” flat panel monitor – qty 1, (7) hard-shell microplates – qty 1, white shell, white walls, 50/pk, (8) 0.2 ml Optical, flat strip caps, ultra-clear, 8 per strip, 120 strips – qty 1, (9) thermal cyclers (including Alpha Units) come with a standard 2 year parts and labor warranty – qty 1, (10) the Opticon accessory, computer and monitor come with a 1 year warranty – qty 1. M J Research is the only known manufacturer of this system that has the necessary features of no moving optical parts, instead of a scanning CCD camera, for optical measurements and a temperature gradient sample block which allows for condition optimization in a single experimental run These features are necessary to perform quantitative PCR and RT PCR experiments and are not found among similar products such as the ABI Prism ® 7000 Sequence Detection System and the Cycler IQ real-time PCR Detection System. These features are necessary because a continuous signal increases data quality (no moving optical parts) and condition optimization can be found in a single experimental run (temperature gradient sample block). The DNA Engine Opticon 2 System is a continuous fluorescence detection system that utilizes a thermoelectric Peltier-Joule heat pump module for all heating and cooling operations with multi-sensor/multi-zone temperature control technology, thermal accuracy of 0.3C, well-to-well uniformity of 0.4C, accommodating 96 samples, in place or strip tube format, with optional programming of a thermal gradient of up to 24C, across the 96-well sample block, yielding less than 0.4C variation from the predicted temperature.  These performance specifications, which are fulfilled by the DNA Engine Peltier thermal cycler, are necessary for experimental compatibility with two identical thermal cyclers currently present in the laboratory.  The research also requires a continuous fluorescence detection system that excites fluorescent dyes with absorption spectra in the 450 to 505 nm range, and optimized for dyes with emission spectra in the first channel of 533/20 nm range, and in the second channel 540-700 nm range.  Especially important is the capability to excite samples sequentially with 96 LEDs, and detect each signal via two photomultiplier tubes (PMT) individually, without any moving parts, in order to ensure robustness of data collection.  The DNA Option 2 System is the only piece of equipment on the market that meets the above requirements necessary for this type of research.  Delivery of this system will take place two weeks after the order is placed with the company.  Government-designated personnel will address any problems noted directly to the contractor.  The procedures that will be used in awarding this contract will be by written quotations or solicitations. The anticipated award date is July 1, 2003.  This is a competitive contract action not set-aside for a small business.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212.3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contractor Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items.

<DESC>17.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI3063 and is being issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI).  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 339111, which has a business size standard of 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure an AKTA Explorer 100A Liquid Chromatography System with an attachment Fraction Collector 950 from the manufacture and the distributor Amersham Biosciences.  The MVDU currently has two AKTA systems in the laboratory.  To introduce NIH employees to a new system at this time would be costly to the government, posing a threat to on-going experiments as well as to educate employees on a new system.  Consistency of using this instrument will allow uninterrupted service as well as continuity of results.  The AKTA System must be able to 1) thoroughly develop purification processes that provide the highest quality and quantity of product, 2) provide access to post-docs for professional development, and 3) provide some redundancy for when we experience equipment failure, which has hindered our efforts recently.  The AKTA Explorer 100A chromatography system is a critical instrument for development of purification processes that meet the requirements of current industrial purification standards.  The system range in flow rates that permits both small scale and pilot plant scale development work.  Data from pilot plant purification work in-house is used to technology transfer process to a contract manufacturer.  The instruments documentation package provides relevant information regarding process validation for supporting and IND submission.  The system enables the automated screening of up to 8 chromatography resins in parallel, and moderate throughput studies on the effects of buffer concentrations such as pH and conductivity on purification. This system has the labiality to purify bimolecular from complex starting materials derived from cell lysates, tissue homogenates and recombinant protein expression systems.  The system will be able to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicty, while retaining biological activity.  This instrument is to allow a fast use method and process development and scale-up for proteins, peptides and nucleic acids.  The AKTA Explorer 100A is designed for all chromatographic techniques employed in method and process development, offering microgram to gram scale purification.  A high level of automation is achieved through UNICORN control software.  A method wizard minimizes preparation run-time and repetitive task while retaining flexibility for easy manual operation.  Samples can be applied at flow rates up to 50 ml/min and fractions can be collected without spillage at flow rates up to 100 ml/min.  The system contains two on-line air sensors, which will assure that air is not pumped onto the columns.  In that event that buffers are depleted, the system will take corrective action.  The system has an UV-900 monitor that can simultaneously monitor three different wavelengths in a range of 190-700nm.  The monitor bandwidth is 4nm with a wavelength accuracy of plus or minus 2nm.  The monitor includes a 10mm flow cell.  The system is a ph/900 monitor that can simultaneously monitor that measures in-line conductivity, temperature and pH.  The monitor allows for auto-ranging between any two ionic strength buffers with conductivity range of luS/cm to 999mS/cm.  The pH range is 0-14 with plus or minus 0.1-pH unit accuracy, temperature compensated.  The attachment Fraction Collector 950 model is for use with the AKTA design chromatography system.  It is fully controlled from the UNICORN software.  The FRAC-950 offers two independent ways of preventing sample loss and the highest flexibility in the choice of collection mode.  Fractions are collected in microplates (over 384 fractions, up to 2.5ml per fraction), a variety of test tube sizes (up to 250ml per fraction).  Different fraction sizes can be collected during different stages of a separation.  In standard fraction collections mode, fractions can be collected in 96-well microplates (up to four) and 12, 18 and 30 mm standards tubes.  Warranted from date of shipment for period of one year.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

Potential offerors making this request must include in their written request an adequate justification for not obtaining the solicitation via the Internet.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Occupational Epidemiology Branch (OEB), plans to enter into a sole source contract with the University of Iowa, Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, Iowa City, IA 52242 for the collection of additional urine samples from corn farmers to enable detailed pesticide exposure assessment within the corn farming study and collect additional blood samples from enrolled controls to study temporal trends in relevant biomarkers among non-exposed subjects.  OEB additional needs for collection of these samples are based on experiences/results from the previous years.  In comparison to general population, farmers have an increased risk of non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and certain other hematopoeitic cancers (i.e., multiple myelomas, leukemia).  Factors that contribute to this excess risk have not been discerned, while several epidemiologic studies have observed an increased risk for NHL among farmers who are exposed to certain pesticides (i.e., pheoxyacetic acids, organophosphates, organchlorines, and triazines), these studies have not been conclusive; nor has a clear mechanistic association between farming pesticide exposure and subsequent development of cancer been identified.  Given that immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk for NHL, it has been hypothesized that altered immune function may be an indicator of increased potential for the development of immunologically based diseases such as NHL.  It is critical to the research of the OEB for a continuation of the Corn farming study, which is a sub-study of the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) (Iowa contract #NO1-CP-81119).  The University of Iowa, Department of Epidemiology is the only source known to the Government that can provide this service without changing existing variables.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, without changing variables, it may submit a statement of capability.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than 1:30 P.M. EDT on June 20, 2003.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) intends on entering into a sole source contract with Harvard School of Public Health, Environmental Epidemiology, 665 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115.  REB conducts interdisciplinary epidemiological studies to identify and quantify the role of ionizing radiation in relation of risk of cancer.  An investigation of cancer risks in a large cohort of U.S. Radiologic Technologist were certified for two of more years during 1926-82, found elevated risks for non melanoma skin cancer among subjects who began working as radiologic technologist before 1950, and risk rose with increasing number of years worked before 1950.  Non melanoma skin cancer (which includes the two major types -basal cell skin cancer and squamous cell skin cancer) is the most frequently occurring malignancy, with more than one million new cases diagnosed annually in the U.S.  The major known cause of non melanoma skin cancer is ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure, particularly in persons with red or blond hair, blue eyes, and/or skin that burn easily and does not tan.  High levels of ionizing radiation have been associated with increased risk of non melanoma skin cancer, but risks of non melanoma skin cancer have not been extensively studied at moderate or low levels of ionizing radiation exposure.  Ionizing radiation exposure results in cellular damage at the DAN level, primarily observed as single strand breaks and oxidative base damage.  Prevention of neoplasia is dependent upon the proficient repair of such damage to avoid the accumulation of somatic mutations.  XRCCI is a protein involved in both the base excision and strand break repair pathways, making it an attractive candidate for the investigation of ionizing radiation susceptibility.  There are nine (9), published polymorphisms in the XRCCI gene that result in an amino acid substitution.  Three of these (codon 194, 280 and 399) occur with a population prevalence amenable to epidemiologic study.  In order for REB to evaluate risks and dose-response effects for ionizing radiation exposure, ultraviolet radiation exposure from the sun, constitutional factors (such as hair color, eye color, and skin color), and genetic factors in the etiology of non melanoma skin cancer, a series of pilot studies is required to provide important information for developing the study protocol.  The services in this study will be carried out using DNA and questionnaire data form subjects participating in an existing Case-Control Study in New Hampshire.  The Department of Cancer Cell Biology, at Harvard School of Public Health is the only source known to the NCI with the expertise in molecular epidemiology and genetics.  Harvard School of Public Health is the only source known to NCI that has access to the samples, expertise and qualified personnel that can run the statistical aspects of the proposed requirement.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 P.M. EDT, on June 20, 2003.  For further information please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.

<DESC>SSA has a requirement for ongoing Clerical Support Services at its Headquarters folder storage MEGASITE located in Baltimore, MD. This requirement will be WHOLLY SET ASIDE AS A COMPETITIVE 8(a) Commercial Item/Service in accordance with FAR Parts 12,15 and 19.  SSA anticipates awarding a Requiremnts type contract with the initial Period of Performance being August 25, 2003 to August 24, 2004 with Options for four(4) additional one year periods. The applicable NAICS Code is 561210 with a Size Standard of $6 million. SSA will make award on a Best Value Basis considering Technical Capability, Experience and Past Performance in addition to Price. The Megasite currently has @ 145 FT and 25 PT contract employees. The Megasite currently maintains approximately 6 million beneficiary folders primarily from its Baltimore, MD Program Service Center (PSC). The contractor shall provide all necessary management, supervision, personnel, training, reports, insurance, materials, services, equipment and supplies necessary to provide clerical support services at the Megasite facility.  Any permits, insurance and licenses required to comply with all Federal, State and municipal laws and ordinances shall also be included. The Megasite utilizes a Terminal Digit Filing System (TDFS). Claims folders are filed in the Megasite by terminal digit.  The SSN is comprised of nine numbers which are broken down into three sections: Example:123 (Area)-45(Group)-6789(Serial)The last four numbers, known as the serial number, are used as the common identifier to control, file and retrieve claims folders. The contractor shall perform the following folder-related services (1) Folder Refiles. Refiling requires the contractor to put a folder back into the same box in numerical order from which the folder was taken initially. Folder refiles are a high priority.  Folders must be returned to the appropriate box to allow for other related services such as dropfiles and folder retrievals to be performed. (2) Folder Retrievals. Requests for SSNs from PSCs, Field Offices and other SSA offices are entered into the PCACS case control system. PCACS automatically places all the requested SSNs from a particular location in numerical order on a list that is electronically transmitted overnight to be available to the contractor. The contractor will use however many employees it takes to process the list that day.  The contractor will take that list and any other special recalls received during the day and retrieve the requested folders from the pertinent file. Individual folders requested by Field Offices or other SSA offices will be packaged for Fedex shipment the same day. (3) Dropfile Material. A dropfile represents any paper material that needs to be placed in a folder.  Multiple sheets for the same folder count as one dropfile.  Dropfile material includes single sheets of paper and/or bundles of paper. The requirement is that this material be correctly dropfiled within two workdays of receipt.(4)Temporary Folder Preparation: Temporary folders are prepared for dropfile material when the permanent folder is temporarily located outside of OCO. (5)Sequencing. The task of sequencing is a process to insure that folders within each active file remain in numerical SSN order. Sequencing is a means of maintaining accuracy standards and the integrity of the files.  It also increases the ease and accuracy of all folder related activities at the Megasite.  Sequencing services may be performed yearly during the course of each contract year at the request of the Project Manager. (6)Files Inactivation: Once or twice a year SSA will remove the inactive folders from the Megasite and send the folders to be maintained in a Federal Records Center (FRC) or the National Record Center.  SSA will provide the contractor with a listing of all inactive folders SSNs with SSNXs that are to be shipped to the FRC or NRC. (7) Validation: It is extremely important to be able to quickly find every folder that is requested. Many times folders are misfiled causing NIF situations, which reduce the Government’s ability to properly service the public.  SSA will order a validation at the beginning of the base year and the beginning of the third option year. (7)PCACS is a computer terminal and software system used by SSA as a case control system to pinpoint the exact physical location and movement of the Agency’s tens of millions of folders.  The contractor will have to learn this system in order to determine into which active file a piece of material or a folder should be filed. Protective security requirements require Contractor personnel who have access to SSA facilities shall be required to undergo a background investigation, which will be conducted by the Government.  Such investigation shall include a check by fingerprints and a statement of personal history. Service Contract Act provisions apply. Refer to FAR 52.222-50, Non-displacement of Qualified Workers, (May 1999). Any qualified 8(a)firm which believes it has the relevant experience, personnel, facilities, systems, etc. to perform the described tasks should notify the Contracting Officer by e-mail or fax of their interest in this requirement. The solicitation, when issued, will be available on the FEDBIZOPPS WEB Site (www2.eps.gov) in @ 2 weeks.  The solicitation will include information regarding the current contract including pricing data.  Requests for historical information received prior to release of the RFP will not be honored. A SITE SURVEY will be scheduled at a later date.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Shanda Georg Business Specialist 7037871758     Shanda.Georg@mms.= gov;
<DESC>Questions received within the date and time specified and the governm= ent's response. 1.   What is the anticipated timeline for awarding the contract? Government Response:  Mid July, 2003. 2.   Would you consider receiving a proposal with increased timelines and a=  description of the anticipated issues to be encountered and the reasons fo= r delay? Government Response: We would consider it, but a proposal able to meet the = timelines will likely be more highly rated unless the issues raised suggest that any offeror should have recogni= zed that the timelines are unachievable. 3.   Do Amgen and Ortho Biotech have both the protocols and the data for ea= ch study prepared and ready to be transferred? Government Response: Yes 4.   Could you please provide a detailed synopsis of each trial available, = including a description of the relevant data collected in each?  For exampl= e, describe the data available for analysis in the following manner:  Phase=  of each study, dosing history and regimen in each study, type(s) of malign= ancy, what chemotherapy treatment(s) and=20 regimen(s) the patients have received, times and amounts of blood transfusi= ons, number of patients/subjects, number of biological samples collected an= d frequency of collection: which analytes are available (e.g., erythropoiet= in, darbepoietin), RBC, precursor cell counts/reticulocyte counts, iron the= rapy, ferritin, concomitant medications, etc. Government Response:  This level of detail will only be provided to the awa= rded contractor, under confidentiality.  Inventory and data qualification o= f the available studies to select those that are pertinent to this project = will be part of the project.  Data may be made available from at least 5 st= udies for each agent, which range from dose finding to phase III studies, i= n a variety of cancers, including regimens that are platinum and non-platin= um containing. About =BC of patients are estimated to have required transfu= sions.  Clinical data may be available for approximately 1000 patients, wit= h 510 samples for about 200 patients for epo levels,. Reticulocyte counts a= re available for only a minority of patients in more recent studies, as is = data regarding iron stores. The awarded contractor will be able to review a=  paragraph for each possible study data source and then enter a dialog with=  each co-sponsor to identify more details regarding the data sets that will=  actually be used in the model. 5.   What is the format of the data, e.g., SAS transport format, Excel, etc= .? Are the data in clinical database format or in analysisready datasets? Government Response:  In preparing your proposal, assume that the data are = in a common clinical database format, not in datasets ready for NONMEM or o= ther population PK program 6.   Could you provide further clarification regarding Page 4, TASK I, Sect= ion A, 2, 1) of the Solicitation ("coupling of erythropoietin elimination rate and erythropoietin sensitivity (through = number of erythropoietin receptors)")? Government Response:  There is some evidence that epo is cleared via bindin= g to its receptors, and the size of the erythron (the hematopoetic "organ")=  both alters clearance rate and the ability to respond to epo.  This establ= ishes a potential non-linearity where the response to epo can be altered by=  both the responsiveness of the erythron in the face of chemotherapy and th= e size of the erythron. Please consider the complexities of evaluating the = importance of these potential non-linearities and feedback mechanisms in yo= ur model. 7.   Page 8, TASK III, Section 2 references dosage regimens which would be = provided for the simulations:  Are you anticipating a series of simulations=  which utilize a distribution of chemotherapy treatments paired with one sp= ecific hematopoietic growth factor regimen OR a series of simulations utili= zing pairs of a specific chemotherapy regimen and a specific hematopoietic = growth factor regimen? Government Response: We envision an initial simulation evaluating  two chem= o regimens (one with, one without a platinating agent), and several differe= nt regimens for growth factor, as described in the task - e.g., a minimum o= f 3 different doses and 2 dosing intervals for each agent. 8.   For the simulations, should a set number of dosage regimens be planned=  (if so, what number?) or should the cost be provided on a per dosage regim= en basis?=20 Government Response: See response to question 71  The precise parameters of=  the initial model are difficult to estimate without exploring the paramete= r space and potential models.  It seems unlikely that there is a linear rel= ationship between the cost of this trial and the possible need for addition= al explorations of effects of dose magnitude, dose frequency, and outcome a= ssessments after evaluation of the initial simulation experiment.  Once the= re is a satisfactory model, additional exploration may be in order, so it's=  difficult to estimate the number of additional simulation experiments in a= dvance. For the purposes of estimating the contract costs, assume 12 treatm= ent regimens (3 doses and 2 dose intervals) and 2 chemotherapy regimens for=  the initial effort, as well as approximately 5 outcome measures (eg, % of = patients who increase hgb >12 within 8 weeks, or transfusion requirements).=   One or more additional simulation experiments may subsequently be warrant= ed to fully define the dose/schedule - response surface. 9.   Page 8, TASK III, Section 4: is this step intended to be performed on = the base model used for generating the simulations or every simulation scen= ario? Government Response:. Sensitivity analysis should be performed on what is c= onsidered to be the most crucial conclusions.  For example, if the initial = simulation experiment permits an estimate of the ratio of the ratio of the = weekly doses of the two agents, each producing a hemoglobin rise of 2 withi= n 8 weeks in at least 50% of patients, what is the sensitivity of the dose = ratio to specific model assumptions? We estimate that there might be a half=  dozen such crucial conclusions (eg transfusion rate) and a half dozen crit= ical model assumptions that might require testing. 10.  Does the limitation regarding the provision of separate reports to eac= h commercial sponsor preclude the pooled modeling of the erythropoietin and=  darbepoietin, i.e., does confidential data refer to raw and analysis data = only or does it also include modeling results? Government Response:  The model should be developed using all the appropria= te data  from both corporate sponsors - we want one model that responds to = both agents.  .  The competitor company will not be provided with drug spec= ific parameters or simulated responses for any but the drug they provide.  = The  general outline of the biology represented in the model will be availa= ble to both sponsors. 11.  We would appreciate clarification of the conflict of interest requirem= ents.  If either of the two companies=20 (Amgen or Ortho Biotech Products) identified in the RFQ are former or curre= nt clients of our company, are we precluded from qualifying as a responder = to the RFQ. Government Response:  As a condition of award the Contractor must have no r= ecent prior or current (at the time of award) financial interests or relati= onships with either of the companies (Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. and Amge= n, Inc.) or their affiliates that could lead to a perceived or real conflic= t of interest.  In addition, as a condition of award the Contractor must ag= ree that it will acquire no financial interest or relationship with either = of the companies (Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. and Amgen, Inc.) that could = lead to a perceived or real conflict of interest, for a period of 6 months.=  This period of restraint is necessary to avoid the circumstance of unfair = competitive advantage or potential bias.  If Amgen or Ortho Biotech Product= s, or subsidieary is a current client, it is a conflict of interest.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR the VIBRATION CONTROL & DATA REDUCTION SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to (1) Post Questions and Answers that have been asked concerning this solicitation. (2)To  extend the due date for recept of offers to June 23, 2003			  Questions and Answers 1.    Does Rack Mountable in Physical Characteristics include the Monitor? A 20" Monitor has been specified. The external dimensions will not fit in a 19" EIA Rack. A 17" flat screen will fit, but is a conflict with your Rack Mountable Specification. Ans:	 The data acquisition box must be rack mountable.  The 20” color monitor will sit on the desktop, so it is not a rack mount.  However the CPU, will sit on the desktop close to the operator.	The length of the cable for data acquisition box and CPU is at least 20 feet.  If it is a limitation to the proposed system, then the CPU must be rack mountable as well. 2.      Is a "sub System Module" an enclosure for measurement channels? You reference synchronization between modules, does that imply you seek small boxes that can be added or rented to increase the size of the system or a larger box to handle the 70+ channels you "may" use from time to time? Ans:     Sub-system modules, are additional data acquisition boxes, and expand this data acquisition system to handle more input channels (say 40+, or up to 300).  All the additional boxes should be synchronized with IRIG-B time signal.  We have a master IRIG-B clock signal available to patch to this new system and this system should have an IRIG-B interface card installed in either data acquisition boxes or PC CPU box.  All the test time and data reduction time should be referred to this time signal.	3.   You say, "all system functions shall be controllable via the Local Area Network...". Please elaborate. Ans:	   This PC should have the ability to be connected to our JSC domain and network printers, except during the tests (running the random, sine, and shock).  It should be shareable and capable to transfer the test reports through the network. 4. Your references to Windows NT, 2000 and XP exclusively seem to preclude Linux and/or Unix, is this the correct conclusion to draw from your specification? Ans: This PC should be compatible to our NASA/JSC standard workstation.  If the proposed system needs to run the test and data reduction on something other than our standard (Linux), then the system must have dual bootable OS and the final product of the test reports and the analyzed files must be in the MS Office compatible format.  5.	 You reference Throughput Disk operation as requiring spectral data and time data being stored there. Is this an error or do you require the feature as described? Ans:  It is preferred, so after completion of the test sequences, it only has one area to back up all the related data of the test to CD.  Otherwise, time history data on through put disk and spectral data on PC local drive is acceptable.  6.    In the Random section, you describe the need for "multi channel drive signal control". What does this mean? Ans:	   The system for this procurement is a single channel drive output control system with multi-channel averaged control (from 2 to 32 channels averaging).  However, this system should be able to upgrade to multiple channel drives output control.  That means the system can control two or more individual drive signals to shakers (up to 4 or more shakers).  The offerors need to demonstrate their capability.  7. In the Sine section you require the system to allow the setting of the frequency range and number of harmonics over which to perform sine reduction. Please provide detail. It sounds as though you may be asking for Tracked Resonance Search and Dwell. Is that the capability being sought? Ans:	 In order to get harmonics, it should be in Dwell Sine with fixed frequency or step sine with duration.  This is for data reduction only.   8.   What is DC analysis of sine data? Ans:  It is a DC shift during the sine sweep test.  This is for data reduction only, and mostly it is for troubleshooting.    The due date for receipt of offers is  extended to June 23, 2003. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on June 3, 2003. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The determination discussed below is still pending final approval.  A final decision has not been made.  Once a final determination has been made, the  result will be posted to this site.  I apologize for any confusion. The determination has been made by the Government, with the assistance from SBA  representatives, to set aside the project described below for 8(a) Small  Business Concerns that are certified in Region 5, Kentucky, West Virginia, or  Pennsylvania.  This is just a general announcement.  A solicitation for this  project has not been posted.  The Government intends to post a solicitation for  this project fifteen (15) days after the formal synopsis has been posted.  Only  those 8(a) contractors who have a Region 5, Kentucky, West Virginia, or  Pennsylvania certification will be eligible to submit a proposal for this  pending solicitation.  If you have questions concerning your Region 5 8(a)  certification, please contact your local SBA representative. Project Number 981911A: Renovate for DPC, Facility 30002 Project Number 981911C: Provide Furniture for DPC Fac. 30002 Project Number 981911D: Provide Furniture for DPM Fac. 30002 Solicitation Number F33601-03-R-0047 The Air Force is seeking possible sources for a potential  100 percent set-aside for 8(a) small business concerns, or  sole source set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns.   If adequate responses are not received, the acquisition may  be solicited on an unrestricted basis.  This is a sources  sought notice for planning purposes only.  The work will  include the scope in the above-mentioned project numbers.   The scope will also include the architectural, electrical,  environmental, fire protection, mechanical, and plumbing  modification and reconfiguration of Bays 1, 2, 3, and 4 in  Facility 30002 to meet the functional requirements of  multiple service organizations.  In addition to providing  and installing new systems furniture, there is a  requirement to utilize and reinstall existing systems  furniture.  The estimated price range is between $5M and  $10M.  The NAICS Code is 236220. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: Facility 30002 is being  renovated to house the main administrative offices and  customer service areas for the personnel management  organizations servicing both the military and civilian  population of WPAFB.  The main organization currently  housed in this facility is the military personnel office.   Since this office will remain in operation during  construction, minimizing the impact to this mission will be  a critical concern.  The extremely high level of visibility  of this project will result in an unusually high level of  scrutiny by all levels of WPAFB leadership.  The building  currently occupied by the civilian personnel office is  scheduled for demolition.  This major renovation will  involve the complex management of numerous disciplines  (inlcuding the installation of sytems furniture), working  simultaneously, and critical phasing and scheduling  requirements.  The contractor must have extensive  experience in the management of large multi-disciplined  projects in order to successfully complete this effort.   Failure to supervise and coordinate the different trades  required to provide a quality and timely product will not  be acceptable as it would result in the disruption of the  long range plans for the using organization.  This would  trigger a "domino effect" which will negatively impact the  long range plans of several other organizations. In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, the contractor must  be registered in the CCR prior to award of solicitations  issued after 31 May 1998.  Tel: 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax: 1-703- 696-0213.  DUNS/CCR Website: http://www.ccr.gov.  Every  solicitation issued after 31 May 1998 must include the  clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, "Required Central Contractor  Registration." Prime contractors who are 8(a) or HUBZone small businesses,  and who intend to submit a bid for the solicitation (when  issued), MUST submit the following by 4:00 P.M. EST on 5  May 2003.  Responses should include the following: (1) A positive statement of your intention to submit a bid  for the potential solicitation as a Prime Contractor; (2) The date of 8(a)/HUBZone small business certification; (3) A listing of work similar in type and scope to include  contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and  points of contact with phone numbers; (4) Evidence of capability to secure performance and  payment bonds based on the estimated value range provided  above; (5) If you are an 8(a)or HUBZone company considering a  joint venture, you will need to provide proof that this  consideration has been forwarded to the cognizant SBA  office for approval. Contractors interested should provide the above  documentation in duplicate (one original and one copy).   All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for  a decision to be made on the availability of interested 8 (a) and HUBZone concerns.  Responses shall be limited to  five (5) pages.  Failure to submit all information  requested shall result in a contractor being  considered "not interested" in this requirement.  A  decision on whether or not this potential effort will be  pursued as an 8(a) set-aside, sole source HUBZone set- aside, or an unrestricted basis will be posted as a  modification in the Federal Business Opportunities.

<DESC>Air Force Manpower and Innovation Agency, Air Force Manpower Requirements Utilization Squadron, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas is seeking GSA sources capable of providing a commercial off the shelf (COTS) management scheduling and tracking software tool similar to the Air Force Manpower Office Scheduling Tool (AFMOST) requirements.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only.  This information will be used in conducting market research to identify potential GSA sources and commercial products, and obtain prices.  It should be noted that the need for cost/price data, if even only rough order of magnitude data, is to assist in the planning process.  This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bid (IFB), request for proposal (RFP), or request for quotation (RFQ), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the United States Air Force.  AFMOST Overview: The AFMOST system will provide an electronic means of tracking projects being performed at bases throughout the Air Force.  The software must be web-based utilizing a database for storing inputted data.  The tool must allow for two-way communication regarding tracking and one-way downward tasking capability.  There will be three levels of organization with approximately 3000 users.  The upper two levels of organization (Higher Headquarters and Major Command (MAJCOM) will have the ability to task downwards and view all organizations under their purview.  The bottom level will have the ability to self-task, receive taskings from higher headquarters and view their respective tasks.  Regardless of the method of development, the end result will be a software tool housed at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas and accessible only to authorized users via the Internet.  System Requirements: (1) Must be Web-based; (2) Must comply with Department of Defense (DoD) Common Access Card regulatory requirements for program log-on; (3) The following is a list of data the program must capture and track by associated unit (e.g., Higher Headquarters, MAJCOM, or Base Level): Organizational Name, Major Command Name, Higher Headquarters Name, Category of Work, Task Name, Task Duration, Number of Assigned Personnel, Personnel Utilization Rate by Organization, Graphical Task Status Indicator, Task Percent Complete, Start and Finish Dates, Adjusted Start and Adjusted Finish Dates, Suspense Date, Fractional Manpower Associated by Task and Totalized by Organization; (4) Report views must be customizable by selecting one or more of the inputted fields above.  Reports must provide a visual representation of the information selected for each report; and (5) Must provide an automated historical transaction log of all actions made by task to include user-defined notes.  System Compatibility: The application must be compatible with Air Force computer systems and comply with DoD and Air Force policies.  Interested vendors should e-mail their capability statement/information to Nelda Lopez,12 CONS/LGCB, Nelda.Lopez@randolph.af.mil and MSgt David Moen, david.moen@randolph.af.mil or MSgt Mitch Kuhl, mitch.kuhl@randolph.af.mil.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to issue a Request for Quotations under FAR Part 13—Simplified Acquisition Procedures for a pilot project to evaluate a pre-panel screening process for SBIR/STTR Phase I Proposals.  One hundred proposals in a specific technical area (to be determined) will be provided to the contractor for review by their technically qualified experts.  “Technically qualified expert” is defined as an individual with extensive technical business and/or academic experience in the area of technology, science and/or engineering that underlies the proposal being reviewed.  For each proposal, the contractor will provide three reviews and a summary of the reviewers’ findings and recommendation, consistent with the NSF review criteria.  See  http://www.eng.nsf.gov/sbir/peer_review.htm.  Of the 100 proposals, the contractor will identify approximately 50 that can be recommended for submission to the existing NSF review panel process.  The SBIR/STTR program will also submit the same 100 proposals to the current NSF panel review process, and will compare results to determine the effectiveness of the contractor’s screening process.  The period of performance is expected to begin June 1 and end October 31.  NSF anticipates award of the pilot project to no more than three qualified offerors.  The RFQ is anticipated to be available on FedBizOps and the NSF website (www.nsf.gov) on or about March 24.  See Note 1 and 26.

1.  Supplemental Text Sections L (Proposal Preparation Instructions) and M (Evaluation Procedures) are hereby deleted. Pages 21-26 of the RFP are applicable.  Clause M10G is hereby changed.


2.  Pricing:  The Contractor is to provide pricing for the base period and option period.  Attachment 1 identifies the NSNs, and estimated annual demand quantities for the base period and option period.  Please provide contractor pricing on this spreadsheet.  Contractors are encouraged to consider minimum order quantities (MOQ) when setting prices.  Contractors are not required to honor orders for quantities less than the MOQ (see Clause I67, FAR 52.216.19).  However, it is important to note that offers
will be evaluated based on the estimated annual demand quantity (EAD, see Clause M12, FAR 52.216-9G09).  These numbers are based on the best projection available at the time of this solicitation and are subject to change.  Some of the NSNs may have EADs of zero; however, these NSNs may not necessarily have zero demands.  They may, in fact, be items recently assigned to DSCR, or items for which historical data is other wise incomplete or unavailable, or items for which the Government has no
recurring demands and therefore, cannot forecast any realistic estimates. Offerors are encouraged to submit offers consistent with quantities reflected in their own historical data where available.


3.  For evaluation purposes, each individual NSN will be evaluated by multiplying the proposed unit price times the EAD to arrive at the estimated total for each NSN.  In those cases where the estimated annual demand quantity is zero (0), the Government will use (1) to represent the quantity .


4.  Contractors are required to submit one copy of the completed
solicitation, completed pricing attachment (Attachment 1, electronic is encouraged) and a surge plan (Attachment 2, if applicable)

<DESC>1.  Supplemental Text Sections L (Proposal Preparation Instructions) and M (Evaluation Procedures) are hereby deleted. Pages 23-25 of the RFP are applicable.  Also Clause M10G is hereby changed.


2.  Pricing:  The Contractor is to provide pricing for the base period and option period.  Attachment 1 identifies the NSNs, and estimated annual demand quantities for the base period and option period.  Please provide contractor pricing on this spreadsheet.  Contractors are encouraged to consider minimum order quantities (MOQ) when setting prices.  Contractors are not required to honor orders for quantities less than the MOQ (see Clause I67, FAR 52.216.19).  However, it is important to note that offers
will be evaluated based on the estimated annual demand quantity (EAD, see Clause M12, FAR 52.216-9G09).  These numbers are based on the best projection available at the time of this solicitation and are subject to change.  Some of the NSNs may have EADs of zero; however, these NSNs may not necessarily have zero demands.  They may, in fact, be items recently assigned to DSCR, or items for which historical data is other wise incomplete or unavailable, or items for which the Government has no
recurring demands and therefore, cannot forecast any realistic estimates. Offerors are encouraged to submit offers consistent with quantities reflected in their own historical data where available.


3.  For evaluation purposes, each individual NSN will be evaluated by multiplying the proposed unit price times the EAD to arrive at the estimated total for each NSN.  In those cases where the estimated annual demand quantity is zero (0), the Government will use (1) to represent the quantity .

<SOLNBR>DAAB07-03-R-E217
<RESPDATE>071403
<ARCHDATE>09122003
<CONTACT>Simone  Lucy, 732-427-1538
<DESC>NA The Government requires a provider for Network Services and Integration over L-band satellite, providing connectivity from multiple mobile platforms (using Comtech Mobile Datacom MT-2011E or MT-2010-04 terminals for communications on the move), to designat ed Operations Centers at several locations around the world, as a part of Future Battle Command, Brigade and Below (FBCB2) / Blue Force Tracking (BFT). Network connectivity is needed in Eastern and Western Europe, Northern Africa, Southwest Asia, to includ e Afghanistan, Continental USA (CONUS), and Alaska, beginning in November 2003. Back-up satellite service is required for designated areas in times of increased tension or conflict. An option for back-up service, using alternate providers, must be identifi ed and available for all areas outside CONUS. The satellite network must be capable of handling multiple simultaneous transmissions from the mobile terminals, with a message completion rate of greater than 95% and a latency of less than 12 seconds for all messages.   The selected contractor does not have to directly provide service in all areas. The contractor will be expected to provide all network services, including all communications paths, from the mobile terminals, thru the packet switch server and onto the Opera tions Center LAN, but they are expected to sub-contract with regional communications and satellite service providers, as necessary, to provide best value coverage in each geographic area. The contractor must also provide the technical support necessary to maintain the entire network under all conditions.  Current capabilities and technical description of the BFT Network:  L-Band (1520 to 1570 MHz Fwd Link; 1620 to 1670 MHz Ret Link).  Each mobile terminal (Comtech Mobile Datacom models MT-2011E or MT-2010-04) transmits packetized messages of not more than 1 00 bytes in length, with a variable output power (9dbW EIRP max), and using a Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum signal with either Right Hand Circular Polarization or Left Hand Circular Polarization. Transmission speed is variable from 2400 bps to a maximum of 9600 bps. The number of platforms in any given area will vary from 30 to 2500, with each terminal transmitting at varying intervals of from 30 to 300 seconds. Receivers use similar speeds and operate at signal levels greater than 27dbW from the satellit e. The data received at the Earth Station is sent to a packet switch server at the Operations Centers over dedicated circuits. The packet switch server processes the data and acts as the gateway onto the operational LAN within each Operations Center. (Noti onal Satellite Network Architecture drawing is available upon request).  For request of drawing email Simone.Lucy@mail1.monmouth.army.mil AND Michael.Doelling@mail1.monmouth.army.mil. Operations Centers are located in Kuwait, Germany, Texas, and California, with an additional Operations Center to be located in Colorado within the year. Operations Center LANs are currently operated and maintained by Northrop Grumman Mission Systems. Current Satellite Network Services are provided by Comtech Mobile Datacom, with satellite service through Thuraya, Inmarsat, Eutelsat, and Mobile Satellite Ventures. Communications links from commercial Earth Stations to the Operations Centers are over VSA T, Internet/VPN, and leased lines. When replying to this survey, indicate:  1)  Your ability to provide services in the regions indicated.  2)  Identify proposed signal paths, naming specific satellite and communications service providers for all circuits (L-Band and communications links).  3)  Provide information on your prior experience in providing this type of service to government or commercial entities and list contracts currently in place. 4)  The US Military conducts short-term exercises in many far-flung areas of the world. Discuss your capability to support these short duration exercises in areas where coverage has not yet been provided. I nclude lead times required for set-up and activation of service. 5)  The Army does not own the rights to the Comtech Mobile Datacom satellite equipment and cannot provide detailed documentation that fully describes the Signal in Space, or the interface at the Operations Center.  Yet, as the network service provider unde r this proposed acquisition, your company would be responsible for interfacing with this equipment.   How would you address this problem?   6)  What could the Army do to reduce risk in this area?   7)  Operations through a US Government controlled Earth Station for service provided outside CONUS is desired.   Address how this could be accomplished.  If this is not possible, the data must be passed unprocessed from the commercial Earth Stations, via a minimum of two independent dedicated circuits to the Operations Centers. Discuss how you would handle this. 8)  Given the need to make these contractual arrangements with the satellite service providers in all the required areas, as the provider of these network services, how quickly after contract award could you provide an operational capability? 9)  Would you propose a firm fixed price or cost plus fixed fee pricing arrangement? 10)  While not expected during the base period of the contract, additional areas that may need to be added to the network are Hawaii, Southeast Asia, Korea and Japan. Future Operations Centers may also be installed in Hawaii and Korea.  Indicate your ability to provide service to these areas and the lead time required to establish the coverage.  11)  Communications Networking Services are required to support two separate and distinct network infrastructures    (1) network that interfaces the Comtech terminals installed on Army vehicles in Europe, Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan with the Operations C enters in Kuwait (Primary Operations Center) and Germany (Backup Operations Center), and, (2) the network that interfaces the Comtech terminals installed on Army vehicles in the Continental US and Alaska with the Operations Center in Colorado (Primary Oper ations Center) and California (Backup Operations Center).  In addition, a future network may be required to support the Korea/Hawaii areas of interest.   Address your companys perspective on if these network infrastructures are better contracted separately or together. 12)  The Army is in need of a way to quantify the needed bandwidth (or the possible range of bandwidths) in a given geographic area without purchasing excess (thus wasting money) or being too frugal (and compromising necessary communications).  There is a desire to achieve a 98% Message Completion Rate with average delay not to exceed 10 seconds for a network of mobile users in any given area.  This performance based requirement would seem better for the Army, overall, and allow industry more innovation in terms of meeting the requirements, but it would be very difficult to accurately measure and verify the required services are being provided. Is there a possibility of demand-based dynamic expansion/contraction of useable bandwidth on the network? Barring that, can usage of satellite time be metered and paid at a per Byte rate?  13)  Can you offer provisions to offer the Army various service levels such as: a) the ability to procure dedicated bandwidth at certain times or b) the ability to procure service on a by platform basis (perhaps in high use areas)? Example: For Continental  U.S. Operations, there may be an exercise at Fort Irwin, California in which the Army needs service for 70 platforms for 6 weeks, could an option be available to just procure that service. Another example could be where service is needed in Bosnia/Kosovo where 300 platforms may be present, but only 200 are operational at any given time. 14)  Under these scenarios, can the Army be guaranteed that necessary bandwidth would be available when needed? 15)  Indicate any other ways you would use to assure needed bandw idth without unnecessary expense. 16)  Can you provide provisions where you can guarantee service bandwidth during Contingency Operations? Bottomline: The Army desires a highly reliable service while still looking at Best Value. A new contract is expected to be awarded for a base period of one year, with one option year. The Government POC for questions regarding this survey is Mr. Tom Denniston, 732-427-5978.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT FOR DEPARMENT OF NAVY (DON) BRAC INFORMATION TRACKING SYSTEM (BITS) DASN (IA), PENTAGON.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is looking for sources to design, develop and produce an information tracking system to conduct data collection and record management in support of the BRAC program effort at Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Infrastructure Analysis).  A non-proprietary system is required that will be composed of three pieces: a "data call engine" capable of maintaining security and full auditing (traceability and transparency) while providing user friendliness, flexibility and reliability; a central document management repository for the deposit of electron files acquired both during the data call process and in the day to day operations of the BRAC office and a data query and extraction tool that is integrated with the data call and document manag ement repository.   The system will be required to support approximately 100 users in the program office.  These users will have privileged access to the system with the capability to create and disseminate data calls, run reports and export data files and control system administration and security.  External web-based users may number 1,000 or more - these users will have the ability only to view and/or edit date call questionnaires and certify submission inputs.  The web based system must be accessible from laptops and desktops worldwide using NMCI and non-NMCI hardware.  This system must comply with SECTION 508 requirements.  The information contained in the system will be unclassified but sensitive and mission critical.  The system will be required to pre-populate data fields from the Navy's  internet Navy Facilities Asset Data Store   (iNFADS) system.  The competition will  be conducted on a best value basis with evaluation criteria based on the following order of importance: technical, schedule and cost.   DASN (IA) envisions procuring a system in phases that will be developed in a build, test, fix approach.   The successful offeror will provide a system that is flexible enough to adapt to hardware, software, and connectivity changes, and at the same time, be capable of responding to evolving user needs.   A draft system specification is available upon request.  Please contact email Lyn Fox at foxlm@navsea.navy.mil to obtain an electronic copy.   The resulting contract will provide for system delivery and acceptance in phases.   A system prototype and related documentation will be required to field the system for testing.  The test phase will begin with system testing by the contractor of the prototype system and will include independent govern ment testing of the system at selected locations; DASN (IA), Navy and Marine Corps.  The testing will be done in an incremental fashion tied to capabilities being developed by the contractor.  The test results will be collected and incorporated into a final system for deployment with full documentation.   Upon deployment of the system there will a provision for system enhancements/maintenance that will extend through the end of the first year of performance.  Maintenance beyond the first performance year will be the subject of a separate contract.  Upgrades to the integrated system are outside the scope of this effort and will be procured separately.    This solicitation is for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is a request for information only and is not a request for proposals (RFP), nor does the Government intend to pay for information solicited. No  contracts will be awarded as a result of this announcement. Responses should be addressed to Commander Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA 02662)1333 Isaac Hull avenue SE Washington DC 20376

<SUBJECT>B -- Improved Solar X-Ray Spectra
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the Space Environment Center (SEC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce to acquire data from an X-Ray Spectrometer flown on a sounding rocket to calibrate GOES X-Ray Instrumentation from the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, Alaska.  A. BACKGROUND: The SEC requires improved on-orbit calibration of solar X-ray instrumentation hosted on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Spacecraft (GOES). The only instrument that can provide the needed data is the Advanced X-Ray Spectrometer (AXS).  The AXS wavelengths are precisely those of interest to NOAA.  The instrument was developed to be flown on a sounding rocket, necessary to get beyond the X-ray absorbing atmosphere, and provide a highly calibrated reference measurement of the solar X-ray spectrum.  This reference spectrum will be used to 'transfer' the calibration of the AXS to the GOES X-ray Sensors (XRS) and the GOES 12 Solar X-ray Imager (SXI).  B. SCOPE:  The proposed contract will upgrade the AXS, obtain data from the instrument when it is in flight and analyze the data.  C. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  September 1, 2003 to August 31, 2006.  D. SOLE SOURCE:  NOAA has determined that only the University of Alaska's Geophysical Institute can meet all of the following government needs:  1)  The University of Alaska has the only known instrument capable of delivering the needed data, the AXS.  The AXS is a unique, existing instrument, custom built for scientific research.  It can be flown, refurbished or modified, recalibrated, and flown again. This meets the critical need for multiple calibrations of the GOES instruments to determine any degradation over time. No satellite-borne instruments can meet these requirements since they cannot be calibrated in flight against a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) primary standard such as the Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility. AXS is not available commercially, and any institution, commercial, academic, or governmental, would need an extensive development period to create a similar instrument. 2) The scientific team that developed the AXS, led by Dr. Scott Bailey now resides at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. This team has the expertise to upgrade the instrument, calibrate the instrument, integrate the instrument onto the rocket payload, and reduce the raw data into the final calibrated deliverable sought by NOAA. This capability has been extensively documented in peer-reviewed literature and at scientific conferences. 3)  The data must be obtained within the next two years since the estimated lifetime of the NOAA SXO instrument is 3 years, which began at the start of 2003.  Due to the Geophysical Institute team's previous experience, it is the only group that will be able to upgrade the instrument, arrange for the instrument to be returned to the rocket manifest, and obtain and analyze the data within the required time period.  4) Since the University of Alaska has substantial current capability and funding from NASA the cost to NOAA of flying this instrument and obtaining the necessary data set is impressively mitigated by the fact that the rocket program is already funded and in place.  The Geophysical Institute has instruments already manifested for flight on the solar research rocket and has a long-term, close working relationship with the rocket program's principal investigator.  In addition, other payloads help reduce the cost to NOAA.  E.  Conclusion:  The Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska is therefore uniquely qualified to carry out this effort.  This notice may represent the only notice.    See note 22.
