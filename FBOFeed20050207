<DESC>The Government intends to award a Requirements type contract with one (1) basic year and four (4) one (1) year options with a Best Estimate Quantity (BEQ) of approximately 702 Trailer Mounted Air Conditioning units.  The air conditioner will need to meet the cooling requirements of various aircraft avionic/electronic systems which currently require the uses of multiple old air conditioners to service the aircraft, where one air conditioner could do the job and substantially reduce the mobility footprint.

The TMAC will also provide conditioned air for personnel comfort during the maintenance activities. 
The self-contained unit will operate on diesel power for flight line use or electric power for hangar operations with the capability to switch between modes without modifications.
The unit provides up to 360,000 British Thermal Units (30 tons) per hour total cooling utilizing an EPA approved non-ozone depleting refrigerant.  Once set, TMAC is required to operate automatically and provides either ventilating air or cool dehumidified air at adjustable temperatures down to 50 degrees Fahrenheit (F) in ambient temperatures between 40 and 120 degrees F.  Air can be discharged at volumes up to 200 pounds per minute with a static pressure of one pound per square inch gage (psig) through two eight inch diameter ducts.  TMAC shall be air transportable in C-130, C-17, and C-5 aircraft.  The RFP will be posted  on/or about 15 Feb 2005.

<DESC>NASA LaRC has a requirement to develop specifications and manufacture a new test nozzle to increase the achievable stagnation pressures in the HYMETS (Hypersonic Materials Environmental Test System) arc-jet facility located at NASA LaRC in Bldg. 1148, Room 104. This work will involve determining the necessary requirements for a new nozzle, developing new drawing, fabricating the nozzle, and a site visit to LaRC to oversee installation and check out of new nozzle. NASA LaRC intends to purchase the items from PEC Professional Services, Inc. (PEC) located in Manchester, TN.  The government's authority for other than full and open competition is that there exists only one qualified source.  PEC specializes in the support of arc-jet facilities such as the HYMETS here at NASA LaRC.  The company has provided several consultations and upgrades to the HYMETS over the past 10 years; thereby, developing a unique knowledge of the design, status, and operating conditions.  This is important as there are only a few operating arc-jets in the United States and none are comparable to the HYMETS here at NASA LaRC.   For this proposal, PEC will take inputs from LaRC for required conditions desired on the model.	We will analyze the conditions using a version of ACE (Aero thermal Equilibrium Code) modified for arc heater testing applications. The results of the analysis will be used to determine a nozzle geometry that will provide required conditions. There are two important issues that will need to be analyzed to determine if they will have an impact on the performance of a new nozzle.  First, we are certain that to achieve the desired conditions the nozzle throat diameter will be larger than ½-inch.  At this time we estimate it will be 30% larger.  We will need to insure the vacuum pump system is large enough to handle any increase in mass flow that may result, depending on operating ranges.  Second, since the nozzle throat will be larger than the bore of the arc heater (1/2-inch) there is a possibility the minimum area of the nozzle may not choke and therefore may not produce supersonic flow.  This is a complex analysis that depends on several variables and we cannot completely depend on analysis alone to determine this.  We will need to test the nozzle to ultimately determine if it will be an issue. We believe the there is a possibility nozzle will work with the existing hardware.  If it does not, then new segments with larger bores and a new anode will be required.  If the new nozzle works with the existing segment and anode geometry, PEC can provide new segments and anodes to LRC for spare parts using the existing geometry. PEC proposes to perform a preliminary analysis and provide a report, which will recommend the nozzle geometry and estimated model conditions.  We will provide firm prices for fabrication of the hardware and provide the engineering and inspection management and shipping.  PEC will contract a fabricator, arrange to purchase material, fabricate the components and deliver the final components when complete.  The following sections describe the services PEC will provide. PEC will perform the necessary thermal and stress analysis for the parts.  Preliminary drawings of the components to be fabricated and of modifications required for existing components will be made and delivered to NASA LaRC for inspection and comments. Once all comments are incorporate, final drawings will be made and delivered to the vendor for fabrication.  Revisions to existing drawings will be limited to “red-line” changes on printed copies of existing components unless electronic files (DXF format) are provided.  If electronic drawing files of existing components do not exist, PEC can produce electronic drawings of these components if requested by LaRC.  An additional fee would be required for this effort as it is not included is this proposal. In any case, all drawings and analysis will be delivered with parts at delivery. PEC will contract the fabrication of the nozzle, split core and if required the segments and anode assembly.  PEC will provide the manufacturer procedures to perform in-process production checks and quality control measurements on each individual part.  Any rework or defect repair will be recorded on the documentation to insure quality control.  PEC will perform and document the necessary pressure check of the components per ASME code B31.3.	All documentation will be provided to NASA LaRC on delivery of the completed parts.	 PEC will provide installation and testing of the components.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 22, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Each major demonstration should be structured to support transitions to existing and future Naval unmanned vehicles and control stations. 

The primary research areas of interest are (1) Collaborative mission planning and dynamic replanning for heterogeneous teams of 5-10 naval unmanned vehicles, (2) Mixed-Initiative Interfaces that support meaningful collaboration between operators and unmanned vehicles to support rapid retasking and dynamic replanning, (3) Replan Assessment to autonomously trigger replanning or alert the operator of changes that impact on mission plan feasibility, (4) Alert management to draw the operator’s attention to important information and assist the operator in responding to alerts, (5) A situation awareness capability to store and provide data required by the other system components, and (6) Integration of planning technologies with a subset of sensor fusion and automatic target and classification technologies to enable fully autonomous dynamic replanning from sensed information only.   

Proposed technologies for multi-vehicle cooperation should be applicable to multiple types of platforms such as air, undersea, and sea surface vehicles. Technologies that are specific to only a single type of platform are outside the scope of this BAA.  Offerors should note that advanced sensors, communications hardware, or hardware technology of any type will NOT be designed or developed under this program, but may be used to demonstrate the Intelligent Autonomy technology products where relevant. Also, specifically excluded is the development of platforms, such as airframes, ground, surface, or undersea vehicles..This effort will not focus on extensive technical development of trajectory generation algorithms, collision avoidance, or formation control algorithms.  Similarly, the development of communications algorithms, network topologies, new systems for speech recognition or gesture recognition or health management systems are out of scope of this effort.   Real-world operational issues must be taken into account including computational requirements, safety, the availability of limited global information and communication, sensor limitations, robustness to uncertainty/errors, and periods of lost, intermittent, or limited communications.  

POP:  Period of performance of 27 months is being sought.  Currently, the governments program is requiring completion within 27 months.  Reasonable deviations/exceptions will be considered.  

CONTRACT TYPE:  NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFAR type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements e.g. Grants, Cooperative Agreements under 10 U.S.C. 2358 and Other Transactions under 10 U.S.C. 2371, and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Other types of contracts may be proposed, however, offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept.  Final decision on award type will be made by the Government.  NOTE:  Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project.  Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFAR and the Competition in Contracting Act.

Proposals received by 21 MAR 2005 will be reviewed for possible award in Fiscal Year (FY) 2005.  The Naval Air Systems Command expects to award one (1) contract in FY 2005. The proposed work should be structured so that there are separate tasks that may be funded with 6.2 and 6.3 funding as appropriate.  Under 6.2 funding, specific technologies will be developed and demonstrated in a simulation environment.    Under 6.3 funding, specific technologies will be integrated and demonstrated in higher-fidelity and more complex simulation demonstration or using a mix of real vehicles and/or simulated capabilities.   

FUNDING:  The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22, "Limitation of Funds".  Anticipated Funding:  Up to .1M of 6.3 funding is anticipated to be available in FY05.  Up to 1.1M of 6.2 funding and 1.4M of 6.3 funding is anticipated to be available for development and demonstration of intelligent autonomy technology in FY06.   Up to 3.0M of 6.3 funding is anticipated to be available for demonstration of intelligent autonomy technology in FY07 (exit year). 
  
EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be evaluated as they are received.  Contract award will be based on the proposal.  Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria, which are in descending order of importance: 

1)  Technical merit and innovation including structuring of the overall demonstration approach to control risk and to produce early maturation of key integration and component issues as well as the degree to which the proposed approach addresses Naval unique needs.  
2)  Risk management in demonstrating objectives.
3)  Potential for transition to specific Navy and Marine Corps acquisition programs in an FY 2006-2008 timeframe.   This shall include the extent to which the government will have data rights to necessary components to transition the technology such as documented source code or flexible application program interfaces.  To achieve a high rating in this category, the offeror should address specifically what interfaces would be used to transition the technology to the particular system as well as describing specific increases in capabilities provided by their technologies to the baseline system and how this could fit the current program schedule.    Unsubstantiated statements that the contractor can transition to a particular Naval system shall be considered nonresponsive.
4)  Offeror's capabilities, including past performance and related experience, experience in transitioning technology onto Naval platforms, facilities, techniques or unique combinations thereof that are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives.
5)  Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed Principal Technical
Investigator(s), Project Manager(s), and other key personnel critical in achieving the proposed objectives. This includes the amount of time allocated to the proposed effort by key personnel.   
6)  Reasonableness of cost of the proposed effort 
7)  If applicable, subcontracting plan 
8)	Availability of funds

An advisory panel (AP) may be utilized to serve in an advisory capacity to the Government Evaluation Panel (EP).  If required, the AP  will serve in an advisory capacity to the EP, but will not have rating privileges, will not have access to vendor price/cost information.  Potential contractor members of the AP may include representatives from Veridian, The Solution Engineering Associates, Inc. and Eagan McAllister Associates, Inc.  Proposals will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-5 and 15.207.

<DESC>This is an amendment to synopsis N6339404R4009 posted 14 January 2004.  The purpose of this amendment is to restate the small business set-aside requirements.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business with cascading set-aside provisions.   The hierarchy of the business types is that small businesses shall take precedence over large businesses.  Proposals from large businesses will only be considered if the government does not receive offers from two qualified small business firms.  The complete details of the cascading set-aside will be stated in the solicitation document. The solicitation invokes an event-based security qualification procedure where offeror's security qualifications are evaluated at three points to ensure only authorized offerors receive access to classified material (the Statement Of Work (SOW) and only offerors who meet security requirements and who can commence performance at the time of award are considered for award.  The three-phase! d events are: (1) qualification (clearance and need-to-know) to receive the SOW, (2) qualification at time of proposal submission and (3) qualification at time of award.  The successful offeror must meet the security requirements for each event and must maintain the required security requirements throughout performance of the contract.  A unclassified or sanitized version of the SOW will not be provided because of (a) the cost of providing various matrixes of documents that may be requested, (b) offerors not receiving the entire SOW will not be responsive and (c) the event based qualification procedure specifies higher standards than the SOW classification level. To be eligible to receive the SOW and to be eligible for contract award, the following security requirements and information requirements must be met.    (Reference: National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) DoD 5225.22-M). SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: (A) have a Defense Security Service (DSS) issued ! facility clearance providing for TOP SECRET personnel clearances and SECRET safeguarding. Such facility clearance must be unrestricted, that is not be under a special security agreement or have any restrictions on access to TOP SECRET, communication security services, cryptographic materials and equipment, Restricted Data or Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and; (B) have an appointed Contractor Special Security Officer (CSSO). REQUIRED DATA: (1) Cage Code (2) Legal Name, Known Name (if different) (3) Physical Address (4) Level of Clearance (personnel clearances authorized must be final TOP SECRET with DCID 6/4 certification (5) Storage/Safeguarding Level (must be SECRET or above) (6) Status of Clearance (must be active – final and favorably adjudicated within the past five years) (7) Facility Security Officer name/phone (8) Classified Mailing Address (9) Cognizant DSS Office location (10) DSS Industrial Security Representative name/phone and (11) a copy of the CSSO ! designation letter. If the designation letter is not government issued, the offeror must also include objective evidence of the source of government authority to make such a designation. All multiple locations require separate submissions for the facility to which the SOW shall be sent. Offerors are cautioned that this information will be verified with the DSS Central Verification Activity (CVA) located at www.dss.mil and any inaccuracies may result in a determination of not qualified to receive the SOW. The above information shall be sent via mail or other carrier to: Special Security Representative (SSR), Naval Surface Warfare Center, 160 Rochester Dr, Louisville, KY 40214-2685 and MUST BE RECEIVED by the SSR on or before close of business, 4:00 pm EST,  09 September 2004.  All offerors are cautioned that the date for receipt of the required security information is firm and will not be extended.  All offerors who previously submitted security information in response to this synopsis must resubmit the required information to be considered.  This address is approved for receipt of classified up to SECRET level.  Offerors may contact the SSR at (502) 417-3396 if a higher-level submission is required.  Failure to furnish accurate and complete information will result in the offeror being ineligible to receive the classified SOW and will render the offeror ineligible to receive contract award.  For offerors who are cleared to receive the SOW, the following security documents will be provided: (1) A DD254 Contract Security Specification authorizing possession of the classified SOW and production of a classified proposal not to exceed the SECRET/NOFORN level and (2) an additional DD254 authorizing higher-level submission upon reques! t and satisfaction of supplementary security requirements. Sponsorship will not be provided for new or upgraded facility clearances. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the procurement is 541330 and the size standard is $23 million dollars.  The proposed acquisition will be a cost plus fixed fee with award term provisions not to exceed 60 months.  Questions regarding this requirement should be faxed to Ms. Ann Marie Hagan at (805) 228-6298, electronic mail is not authorized.  The anticipated release date of the solicitation is 16 September 2004.  Upon release, the solicitation will be available at http://www.phdnswc.navy.mil/procurements/.  This release will not include the SOW.  Copies of the SOW will only be provided to offerors who meet the security requirements.  The closing date for receipt of offers is 19 October 2004.  Note 1 applies.

NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from QTechnology International, Inc. of Centreville, VA., based on the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  These support services will be provided at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center located at Edwards Air Force Base, CA.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems Project Management Office (UAVS PMO) seeks to acquire and field an existing Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (SUAV) system that provides the best overall value to meet the small unit need for real-time recon naissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) and battle damage assessment (BDA).  The system shall have the flexibility to be modified through a Block Upgrade approach to achieve time-phased incorporation of the requirements within the Operationa l Requirements Document (ORD).  The governments objective for Block 0 is for the contractors to demonstrate their existing systems capabilities during a System Capability Demonstration (SCD).  At a minimum, the Block 0 system is required to meet the SUAV  screening criteria, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), Airworthiness and Safety Requirements, and trade space requirements (optional).  The objective for Block 1a is the execution and delivery of LRIP systems and the corresponding program support.  The ob jective for Block 1b is the delivery of Full Rate Production (FRP) systems and corresponding program support.  The objective for Block II is for continued Spiral Development and Horizontal Technology Insertions. AMCOM plans to issue formal RFP Number W58RGZ-05-R-0382 for a full and open competition for the U.S. Army SUAV system on or about 28 February 2005 with proposals due on or about 11 April 2005.  The competition will be conducted in two phases, with the firs t phase resulting in contracts awarded to up to three offerors to demonstrate their system capabilities.  The second phase will result in a contract awarded to one offeror for the production and delivery of LRIP systems and the corresponding program suppor t, as well as for possible follow-on FRP systems.  The Phase I down-select will occur on or about 9 May 2005.  The Phase II/SCD will occur on or about 10 May  30 June 2005.  A best value approach will be used in source selection.   The UAVS PMO is hosting a Pre-Solicitation Conference on 14 February 2005 at the Marriott Hotel, 5 Tranquility Base, Huntsville, Alabama  35805/Phone: 256-830-2222, from 0830 to 1130.  The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Conference is to obtain industry f eedback on technical requirements and acquisition approach.  The UAVS PMO has established an informational Web site at https://www.tuav.redstone.army.mil/suav_ (An underscore _ is after suav.)  Draft technical requirements will be posted at this Web site f or review and additional requirements may be posted prior to the 14 February event.  To access the Web site, you must request a login/password by submitting your email request with your company name, address, and CAGE code to Michael.Dwyer@peoavn.redstone. army.mil .

<DESC>The U.S. Army Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems Project Management Office (UAVS PMO) seeks to acquire and field an existing Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (SUAV) system that provides the best overall value to meet the small unit need for real-time recon naissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) and battle damage assessment (BDA).  The system shall have the flexibility to be modified through a Block Upgrade approach to achieve time-phased incorporation of the requirements within the Operationa l Requirements Document (ORD).  The governments objective for Block 0 is for the contractors to demonstrate their existing systems capabilities during a System Capability Demonstration (SCD).  At a minimum, the Block 0 system is required to meet the SUAV  screening criteria, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), Airworthiness and Safety Requirements, and trade space requirements (optional).  The objective for Block 1a is the execution and delivery of LRIP systems and the corresponding program support.  The ob jective for Block 1b is the delivery of Full Rate Production (FRP) systems and corresponding program support.  The objective for Block II is for continued Spiral Development and Horizontal Technology Insertions. AMCOM plans to issue formal RFP Number W58RGZ-05-R-0382 for a full and open competition for the U.S. Army SUAV system on or about 28 February 2005 with proposals due on or about 11 April 2005.  The competition will be conducted in two phases, with the firs t phase resulting in contracts awarded to up to three offerors to demonstrate their system capabilities.  The second phase will result in a contract awarded to one offeror for the production and delivery of LRIP systems and the corresponding program suppor t, as well as for possible follow-on FRP systems.  The Phase I down-select will occur on or about 9 May 2005.  The Phase II/SCD will occur on or about 10 May  30 June 2005.  A best value approach will be used in source selection.   The UAVS PMO is hosting a Pre-Solicitation Conference on 14 February 2005 at the Marriott Hotel, 5 Tranquility Base, Huntsville, Alabama  35805/Phone: 256-830-2222, from 0830 to 1130.  The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Conference is to obtain industry f eedback on technical requirements and acquisition approach.  Each company may bring only two representatives.  No pre-registration necessary.   The UAVS PMO has established an informational Web site at https://www.tuav.redstone.army.mil/suav_ (An underscore _ is after suav.)

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to add the following: This part required engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part.  Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s).  The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.  An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.  The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. Also, total line item quantity is increased to 58 EACH.

DOCUMENT SECURITY NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.  NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. 

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:  Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:  

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and (c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, (d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.  

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.   

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation. 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

The project scope will provide several enhancements to the software and systems in place at the 1FW GeoBase Integration Office as well as all consulting services, support and user training necessary to empower the 1FW GIO to respond quickly to requests for mapping services and other information made by base personnel who may be responding to a variety of threats to the security of 1FW LAFB; the effectiveness of the 1FW mission and the safety of LAFB personnel. These enhancements will provide 1FW GIO with the ability and confidence to respond immediately to requests for mapping services and other information made by base personnel who may be responding to a variety of threats to the security of 1FW LAFB; the effectiveness of the 1FW mission and the safety of LAFB personnel.  Specific support tasks and deliverables are outlined in Section 7.0 below.

7.0	PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS. Government-furnished equipment and materials are listed in Section 3.9 above.  The Contractor shall be responsible to the GPOC as determined by the COR.  A Non-Disclosure Agreement is required for personnel as well as adherence to a Code of Ethics (Attachments 2 and 3).  Failure to adhere to the non-disclosure agreement and code of ethics will result in immediate termination.  The Contractor must provide a replacement within 15 working days of notification of the termination action.

It is anticipated that funding will be available for estimated 3095 labor hours.  Should additional funding become available, up to 4620 labor hours would be required for optional tasks. Contractor shall propose the appropriate labor category based on the work descriptions to be completed. These taskings and descriptions are as follows:

7.1	Task 1 Enhance Capabilities for Flood Map Toolkit. 
Langley Air Force Base (LAFB) is situated on the shores of the Back River very near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay.  The area upon which LAFB is constructed is a very flat, low lying area directly on the shores of the river.  In fact, most of the buildings on the base are within ½ mile horizontally, and 8 ft. vertically of the salt water.  This combination of proximity to the sea and low topography coupled with the naturally volatile hydrodynamics of the Chesapeake Bay, make the base very vulnerable to flooding during storm events.  Over the course of the past five years, there have been multiple storm events during which buildings at LAFB were flooded.  The results of this flooding can be extraordinarily expensive, but can be mitigated to some degree with sufficient warning and planning.
	 Task requirements, though efforts are not limited to these, are listed below:

•	Work with Base GIS Manager to establish Mean High Water elevation
•	Tool capabilities:
•	Import output from storm surge models. (Source of this model output may be the Navy or the Army Corps.)
•	Forecast flood extent
•	Identify threshold elevation data in relation to predicted flood levels.
•	Identify properties that are at highest risk 
•	Generate emergency response flood map products, impacted building lists, and building manager contact lists.
•	Create flooded area polygon layer for each contour level from 0 to 12 feet.
•	Generate one foot contours based on LIDAR imagery of LAFB
•	Functionality will be deployed to Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher using technologies supported by the LAFB Spatial Data Infrastructure.
•	Deploy spatially enabled impacted building report using existing ArcIMS infrastructure

7.2	 Task 2: Enhance Capabilities for Facility Management.  Task requirements, though efforts are not limited to these, are listed below:

•	Work with GIS Manager to validate Building footprints and floor plans
•	Work with GIS Manager to evaluate current CAD model for existing floor plans
•	Create an automated system to harvest CAD drawings of facility infrastructure on a nightly basis and convert to GIS format for query and visualization
•	Deploy web enabled GIS capability that supports the following capabilities:
o	Visualizes floor plan space by building, organization and functional area.
o	Indicates locations of water supply for fire response personnel
o	Indicates locations of hazardous materials and provides links to MSDS resources
o	Provides link to building manager and emergency response coordinator for each building
o	Indicates flood elevation for each door threshold in the building
o	Summarizes square foot utilization by each category in tabular report format
•	Map series capability will be deployed to create floor plan map books with appropriate information for each floor layout.

7.3	Task 3: Enhance capabilities for the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI).

Langley Air Force Base (LAFB) has developed a significant Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) over the past several years to implement its GeoBase program.  Various components of the GeoBase program have become critically important to support ongoing Base operations.  Present and planned changes in hardware and software components at LAFB require that the DISDI be updated to ensure ongoing operational reliability and performance.  This proposal is for consulting services to assist in upgrading several components of the LAFB DISDI in the coming months.
Task requirements, though efforts are not limited to these, are listed below:

•	Implement Oracle managed backups to take advantage of the new Veritas tape backup system recently installed at the 1FW GIO for development servers.
•	Install relevant Oracle patches and upgrades to the 1FW  ArcSDE server for development servers.
•	Tune the ArcSDE instance to provide better performance especially when serving up the base orthophoto for development servers.
•	Prepare a software and application migration plan to smoothly migrate 1FW GeoBase operations to the ESRI ArcGIS 9.0 software environment.
•	Assist in the implementation of the ArcGIS migration plan.
•	Implement a testing and evaluation program for ArcGIS Server on the 1FW LAFB development server.  This task should be done in conjunction with the geo-processing requirements of the facility-related capabilities enhancements.
•	Assist with the development of a software implementation standards document for the 1FW GeoBase program so that other programs at LAFB (Environment, Housing, etc.) can understand how best to interface with the 1FW GeoBase DISDI.
•	Implement a Citrix infrastructure for deploying ArcGIS to data stewards on LAFB.
•	Configure a versioned editing environment to manage concurrent editing of LAFB DISDI layers
•	Configure ArcIMS to enable LDAP supported layer-level authentication for all LAFB ArcIMS map services

7.5 Project Work Plan.  Within ten work days of award, the Contractor shall coordinate with the 1FW GIO to provide a Kickoff meeting.  The Contractor will prepare and brief a Project Work Plan (PWP) that provides a framework, technical specifications, approach, and schedule for all work to be accomplished during this project as outlined in this SOW.  The PWP will contain, at a minimum, the schedule for each of the primary requirements and their associated deliverables.  This PWP will be used to track the various labor, equipment, facilities, and time required to accomplish tasks for this SOW and the associated quality control requirements.

The PWP must be approved by the COR prior to beginning primary tasks work.  Once approved, the Contractor will not deviate from the PWP without the express approval of the COR.

7.6 Develop Status Updates and Reports.  The Contractor shall prepare and submit a Contractor’s progress, status, and management report (CPSMR) within ten work days after the end of the month.  The CPSMR shall be used to review and evaluate the overall progress of the project, along with any existing or potential problem areas.  The CPSMR shall include a summary of the events that occurred during the reporting period, discussion of performance, identification of problems, proposed solutions, corrective actions taken, and outstanding issues.  The CPSMR shall also detail the project schedule and status through the use of Gantt charts, Microsoft Project or as agreed in the project work plan (Section 7.5), which shall depict percent spent and percent complete for each task.  The CPSMR shall correspond to the same time period as the corresponding invoice. 

7.7 Government Review.  The Government shall review the submitted data and documentation upon completion of all stated work.  Missing or incomplete items shall be documented and forwarded to the Contractor for completion.  Upon receipt of a complete submittal, the Government shall conduct a quality review and notify the contractor within 60 calendar days of acceptance (along with any stipulations this includes) or rejection of the deliverables described herein.  Failure to adhere to any of the stated delivery specifications could result in rejection of deliverables and nonpayment.  Contractors should, at a minimum, submit data and documentation samples at 25% and 75% project completion to avoid the rejection of final deliverables.

7.8 Travel.  It is anticipated that each task will require a minimum of two trips.  The trips shall be conducted as determined by the designated Government Point of Contact (GPOC) with at least three working days notification to the Contractor.  All costs for travel must follow the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) and are the responsibility of the Contractor.  For proposal purposes, the contractor may assume each trip will be 3 days total with an average cost of $1200 per trip.

7.9 Optional Tasks

7.10 Task 4: Threat Assessment Tool is a subordinate to the Facilities Management Tool and has that as a prerequisite. This tool will extend the ability of the LAFB command, emergency response and security force personnel to:
•	Respond to emergency situations utilizing integrated, detailed understanding of building layouts, hazards and occupancy variables. 
•	These situations could include such things as fires, hostage taking, acts of terrorism, bomb threats, floods, chemical spills and many others Create threat assessment reporting and security planning algorithms
•	Respond to emergency situations utilizing integrated, detailed understanding of building layouts, hazards and occupancy variables. 
•	These situations could include such things as fires, hostage taking, acts of terrorism, bomb threats, floods, chemical spills and many others.
•	Speed up the time needed to assess the threat and develop an operational picture and strategy for response. 
•	Leverage other investments by the government in GIS and interoperate with other enhancements such as the Cordon Tool, Facilities Management, Line of Sight tools and others. 
•	Quickly identify vulnerabilities ancillary to the main threat target. 
•	Interoperate with the base map viewer and other GIS-related utilities.
7.11 Task 5: Enhance Capabilities for Emergency Response Cordon Management Tool (DISDI).

Langley Air Force Base (LAFB) presents some interesting challenges to its emergency response personnel.  The base provides homes and employment to over 12,000 people on a daily basis with the expected personnel support services required to manage a large population.  It also houses one of the most deadly arsenals on the planet.  An accident or building fire on an Air Force Base must be managed with a level of respect for safety and security that is commensurate with the potential risk that such an event could represent.

Modern GIS tools represent a great advancement in the way emergency management organizations can plan for and manage emergency events.  LAFB has invested a great deal of time and money in creating one of the most capable GIS systems currently in production in the Air Force.  The Air Force, for its part, has recently completed the migration of an emergency management “Cordon Tool” to ArcGIS 8.3.  This proposal includes the hardware, software, and implementation resources required to implement the new Air Force Cordon Tool at Langley Air Force Base and to make the maps and reports that are produced with the cordon tool available to authorized base personnel through a browser on the Langley intranet.

Because of the distributed nature of the commanders that may require use of the Cordon Tool, and the need to run the tool from a variety of computers that may not have a full seat of ArcGIS installed, we will implement a Citrix server to run the Cordon Tool.  This architecture will allow authenticated users from around the base to interact with the Cordon Tool through a thin client on their local machine.  Reports and maps produced with the Cordon Tool will be published through the Langley ArcIMS server and will be available to authenticated users through their browsers.
	Task requirements, though efforts are not limited to these, are listed below:

•	Create the delivery architecture, configure the systems, and train required personnel in the use of the Cordon Tool are as follows:
•	Acquire and set up Citrix Server.  The server will be a minimum dual 2 Ghz processor server with 4Gig RAM.  The server will be configured at minimum with Windows 2000 Server and Citrix Metaframe XP with 25 client access licenses.
•	Configure ArcGIS and the Cordon Tool to run in the Citrix environment.
•	Configure the Cordon Tool to use Langley Air Force Base data.  Create the base maps and other configurations to use the 1FW GIO ArcSDE data layers.
•	Develop web application to serve up Cordon maps and reports.  Create a web application to run on the Langley AFB ArcIMS server that will serve up maps and reports created with the Cordon tool.
•	Create web-based training materials for the proper operation of the Cordon Tool.  These materials will be developed in conjunction with Langley AFB emergency management personnel.  The materials will be delivered as a web-based application available through a trainee’s web browser.  A corresponding printed training manual will be prepared as a companion to the web-based training.
•	Installation and tuning.  Install the server and software environment into the 1FW GIO server environment.  User groups will be established in conjunction with the 1FW GIO to implement appropriate security policy.  1FW GIO personnel will be trained in the ongoing maintenance of the new server and software systems.
•	On-site training.  Two, one day training sessions will be held at LAFB to train potential users in the proper use of the new Cordon Tool.  LAFB trainers will be part of these classes so that they can take over training for the system at the end of the contract.

7.11	Task 6: Emergency Response Cordon Management Tool

•	Local implementation and configuration of existing USAF “Cordon Tool” software
•	Implementation of Citrix Metaframe environment to support Cordon Tool
•	Develop enhancements to the reporting and mapping capabilities of existing tools
•	Support and training

7.12	Task 7: Line of Sight Tool: subordinate to the Facilities Management Tool and has that as a prerequisite.  This tool will extend the ability of the LAFB command, emergency response and security force personnel to:
•	The primary purpose of this tool will be to provide information about the true line of sight between any two points on the base.  This enhanced capability would provide, among other things, LAFB command, emergency response and security force personnel the ability to: 
•	Instantly identify areas in which ground-based personnel can operate freely out of the line of fire in the event of sniper incident or other similar attack. 
•	Determine precisely which buildings and/or which rooms within buildings are at risk from a targeted attack and from where. 
&#61607;	Which buildings/rooms within buildings could be targeted from the river? 
&#61607;	Which buildings/rooms could not be targeted directly by any line-of-sight threat by water-, ground- or low-flying aircraft based attack and are therefore most secure?
•	Locate appropriate security zones to prevent line-of-sight attacks 
•	Optimize the positioning of observation personnel or security force sharp-shooters to provide coverage of a given area. 
•	Leverage other investments by the government in GIS and interoperate with other enhancements such as the Cordon Tool, Facilities Management, Line of Sight tools and others 
•	Interoperate with the base map viewer and other GIS-related utilities.
•	There are also a number of secondary uses, such as: 
•	Determining the placement of monuments and statuary on base grounds. 
•	Determining ideal placement of warning, advisory and traffic signage. 
•	Identifying the view shed of residences and offices on base.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES OR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE. The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Louisiana is solicting Louisiana State Certified General Real Property Appraisers to prepare an agricultural appraisal required for the acquisition of Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP)easements. The government will issue purchase orders for requirements as they occur. Interested contractors should contact the Contracting Officer by mailing their name, address and telephone number, along with certification documentation. Emails may be sent to patti.woods@la.usda.gov.The following is the Scope of Services:
A. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

	The United States is purchasing a permanent easement that allows the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to protect, restore, maintain, manage and monitor the vegetation and hydrology of the land that is ultimately placed under easement.

B.	AUTHORITY

7 CFR Part 1467, Section 1467.8- Compensation for Easements

C. APPRAISER QUALIFICATIONS

	Appraisers shall be Certified General Real Property Appraisers.

D. PURPOSE OF THE APPRAISAL REPORT

	The purpose of the appraisal report is to estimate the fair market or current market agricultural value of a defined tract of land before the NRCS easement encumbers the land use and without regard to speculative development.

E. BACKGROUND FOR THE APPRAISAL REPORT

	The Appraiser is to:

1.	Conduct a market analysis to assure that the highest and best use of the tract of land is agricultural use.  No consideration shall be given to damages as the result of the easement being placed on the property. Other highest and best uses will not be analyzed or used. Do not consider or include any above ground non-permanently fixed mechanical irrigation equipment. The estimated fair market value will not include water, hunting, fishing or mineral rights;

2.	Adopt all three approaches, income, cost and sales, for determining market value.

3.    View all land currently not being tilled because of a TEMPORARY conservation agreement, contract,
       or  easement or restoration of any type, as cropland;

4.    Arrive at an estimate of value based on the current market value of the land for agricultural use only;

5.	Use agricultural values of bare land found in the market place to justify the value given for such soils or
       cover types and exclude residential, industrial or commercial development uses; appraiser should 
       compare each type of soil in each comparable sale to the subject.

6.	Use comparable sales without residential eligibility. If comparable sales used are eligible for residences,  the comparable sales must be appropriately discounted and well documented, when appraising in zoning restricted rural areas where residences are being developed. The estimated value shall be that for land not eligible for residences;

7.	Document properly that the area to be put under easement is to be treated as an independent parcel and 
       not part of the larger ownership. Sales will be selected on this basis, however no adjustments may be
       needed nor required for differences in size or acres to the parcel and;

8.	Consider irrigation. Irrigation will be included in the determination of agriculture value where irrigation is a factor in agricultural use unless NRCS, for a specific easement, requests that the value be based only on dry land agriculture use.

9.	For sites, soils, or cover types (e.g., woodland and emergent wetland potholes) that do not produce 
       agricultural commodities, the value assigned shall be the typical value found in the market for such 
      soils or cover types excluding residential, industrial, or commercial development uses. Woodlands 
      shall be considered as bare land (cut-over) found in the market place.

10.	It is not the intent of the agency to purchase crop bases, if possible. Unless there is no remaining land 
       on the farm, the landowner should move the base to a non-easement area on the farm. If there is no 
      remaining land on the farm that is adaptable for use of the base, then that crop base value will be 
      included in the appraisal. Supporting documentation of production data is required. Appraiser will 
      include written statement as to whether a crop base was included in the appraised value or not.

	NRCS officials will provide the following to the appraiser:

1.	Aerial photograph of the farm with the location of the proposed easement area identified and an estimate  of the acres in the proposed easement;

2.	Approximate legal description of the easement area (survey to be completed later); Example: On
       attached aerial photograph approximately 10.5 (outlined in dark ink) acres located in the NW 1/4.
       NW1/4 of Section 10 T55N R20W of 5th PM;

3.   Township plat map with farm location identified;

4.   County map showing the location of the farm in the county; and

5.	Aerial photograph indicating the location and acreage of any TEMPORARY conservation agreement,
       contract, or easement or restoration of any type that is to be valued as cropland (i.e., because the area is
       eligible to return to cropland it will be valued as cropland).

6.  Information on easement acres with cropbase, documentation of production data required.

F.  THE APPRAISAL REPORT

1.	A standard narrative appraisal or form report will be provided. This shall be completely filled out, with 
      all points addressed. The appraisal report must follow the guidelines issued in the current copy of the  
      Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP) and may be a limited summary type
      report.  Under authority of 7 CFR Part 1467, the Appraiser may invoke the following USPAP departure
      provisions for the following reasons:

--Standard Rules 1-2(c) and (d); because the purpose of the appraisal is to estimate the market value of the agricultural land without regard to limited access, due to location of the easement tract etc., within the farm. The value estimate requested for purposes of WRP is without consideration of the items listed in 1-2(c).

--Standard Rule 1-2(e), Standard Rules 1-4(f) and (h); because the property is considered to be bare land without improvement or fixtures.

--Standard Rules 1-3(a), (b) and Standard Rule 1-4(g); because the appraiser has relied upon the client’s knowledge of the neighborhood’s real estate and current market conditions and the constraints of the Wetlands Reserve Program. Agricultural use if the only highest and best use consideration. The purpose of the appraisal is to estimate the value of the tract before an easement encumbers land use and without regard to speculative development.

--Standard Rules 1-4(d) and (e); because the client requested a value as if fee simple estate, less hunting, fishing or mineral rights was to be given.

2.	Direct sales comparisons must be supported with sufficient documentation along with photographs to be properly understood and to lead the reader to the same conclusions.

3.    Because of the specified highest and best use (Agricultural Use), any other limiting conditions or other
       departure provisions from USPAP must be fully documented.


G. EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE APPRAISAL REPORT

The effective date of the Appraisal Report is the date the property was personally inspected by the appraiser.

H. CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF THE APPRAISAL REPORT

1.    The confidentiality provisions of USPAP will be followed.

3.	Appraiser’s valuation and supporting reports are confidential information and appraisers shall not
       divulge their findings and opinions to anyone except authorized officials of the U.S. Government.

4.	Any report prepared for the purpose of the U.S. acquisition shall be construed to be the subject of
       potential litigation until the time that the U.S. Government has completed acquisition of the easement
       area.

5.	Consistent with Department of Justice policy, content of reports shall not be discussed without express 
       authorization of NRCS.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the USCG.  The United States Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers of Aircraft work/inspection stands/platforms as described follows:   

The USCG is looking for products, variously called work stands, inspection stands, and platforms that are transportable or semi-transportable for use in performing major inspections and maintenance on HC-130 aircraft in a hanger environment.  Our concept is that the stands will wrap around all or portions of the aircraft allowing maintenance personnel access to the aircraft. Stands would need to be separated into segments such that an aircraft, when the maintenance/inspection is complete, could be moved out and another aircraft moved in easily. Workers would need to be able to go from one stand to the other with minimal or no dismounting. Segments would need to be easily movable by a maximum of three or four people.  

Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options (to include setup and takedown services if available).  Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product.  The Government believes the applicable Cage Codes are 333924 INDUSTRIAL TRUCK, TRACTOR, TRAILER, AND STACKER MACHINERY manufacturing, and 333999 ALL OTHER MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY MANUFACURING.  The size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 750 employees.  Also, please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?  (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business?  (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned?   (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC’s and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POC’s for civilian users for general usage of product questions.  After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the CBD.     Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.  Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to LCDR Andy Eriks at Bldg 78, U.S. Coast Guard, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001 or e-mailed to aeriks@arsc.uscg.mil.  Telephone responses will not be accepted.  Responses must be received no later than 04 March 2005 at 13:00 p.m. PST.  Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the Government make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only.  All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.  All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>The National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) in Norman, OK intends to negotiate with only one source, Lockheed Martin Corporation located in Moorestown, New Jersey for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) engineering, technical and computer support maintenance services for the SPY-1A phased array radar.  However, see Note 22.  The scope of the proposed contract involves OEM engineering, technical and computer program support services in troubleshooting, repairing, and testing of SPY-1A and related equipment system interfaces to facilitate NSSL operations and testing efforts; equipment maintenance; configuration management support, and training for SPY-1A equipment operation and casualty recovery.  The NSSL and a consortium of ten organizations, including the FAA, Department of Navy, and the University of Oklahoma constructed the National Weather Radar Testbed (NWRT) in Norman, Oklahoma to adapt and develop the phased array radar for weather applications.  The NWRT is in the early stages of development and implementation.  For its part, the US Navy loaned a battle spare SPY-1A phased array radar to the NSSL.   The SPY-1A technology was obtained for the NWRT because of the ability for rapid scans.  It is anticipated that adapting this technology for weather purposes can increase warning times by as much as 70 percent.  Using multiple beams and frequencies that are controlled electronically, the SPY-1A’s phased array radar reduces the scan time of severe weather from six minutes for NEXRAD radar to only one minute.   Per the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Navy and the FAA, NOAA is required to maintain the radar in good battle ready operating condition for the duration of the loan.  In order to maintain the equipment in this battle ready state and meet the requirements of the MOA, maintenance services and replacement parts are required from Lockheed Martin.  As the original SPY-1A equipment designer and manufacturer for the Navy, Lockheed Martin has extensive experience and background in the design/development, production and integration, operation and maintenance for the SPY-1A radar.  They are also the only known manufacturer of the parts for the SPY-1A radar and the only one capable of providing the spare parts.  The SPY-1A equipment and technology is proprietary only to Lockheed Martin, which was developed and engineered for the Navy.  Due to the unique capability of Lockheed Martin to provide the needed services and supplies in support of the continued operation of the SPY-1A in NWRT, there is no other one responsible source other than Lockheed Martin.  NSSL’s agreement to maintain the system in battle readiness requires contract support services from Lockheed Martin.  The proposed contract is for a one-year base period and three one-year option periods.  This notice may represent the only official notice of a solicitation.

<OFFADD>Department of Energy, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (DOE Contractor), Princeton University, US Route 1 North at Sayre Drive P.O. Box CN-17, Princeton, NJ, 08543
<SUBJECT>36 -- MCAF Vendor Information Meeting
<DESC>At 9:00 AM on Wednesday, February 23, 2005, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) will host a vendor information meeting on the NCSX Modular Coil Assembly Fixture (MCAF). The meeting will be held at PPPL in Plainsboro, New Jersey. The meeting is expected to take about 2 hours, including time for questions and answers, and will conclude with an optional tour of PPPL.

The MCAF is required to facilitate assembly of the National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX), a magnetic fusion research device jointly designed by PPPL and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and currently under construction at PPPL. Because of the complex shape and extremely close tolerances of the NCSX vacuum vessel and its surrounding modular coil (MC), assembly must proceed in precisely controlled stages.  Placing the half period MC assembly over the NCSX vacuum vessel requires a specially built external assembly fixture that will manipulate the MC half period over the vacuum vessel. This fixture (the MCAF) will require a detailed design and fabrication effort.   

At the information meeting, PPPL intends to provide information on the MCAF preliminary design in order to obtain industry feedback on its manufacturability.  We also intend to gage potential supplier interest and provide an opportunity for supplier 
networking and team formation.   
 
To provide interested parties with advance information, a zip file titled MCAF-050201 has been placed an MCAF sub-folder on the PPPL NCSX manufacturing ftp site. The Zip file contains PDF drawings, DXF files, a servo table listing and an assembly STEP file of the MCAF Reference Design and PDF drawing files of the modular coil winding forms.  The site also contains a draft MCAF specification (NCSX-CSPEC-18-01-00-dA) and two animation clips (se188-000-iso.mpg and se185-000-top.mpg).  All files can be accessed via the MCAF web page at http://ncsx.pppl.gov/NCSX_MFG/MCAF_mfg.htm.

Parties interested in attending the information session should send an email registration request to the PPPL Procurement Division Administrator (email klukazik@pppl.gov, telephone 609-243-2428, fax 609-243-2021) not later than Friday, February 18, 2005. The request must include the company name and address, telephone number, fax number, and the full names and citizenship of each attending representative. To be admitted to the Laboratory, all attendees display a photo ID issued by a Governmental authority (e.g., passport or driver’s license).

PPPL is operated by Princeton University under contract to the United States Department of Energy, and is located on Princeton University’s James Forrestal Campus, off U.S. Route 1 approximately 2 miles north of the town of Princeton. Detailed travel Information, including maps, driving instructions and Laboratory entrance procedures, can be obtained at http://www.pppl.gov/about_pppl/pages/driving_instr_pppl.html.   Information about the NCSX Project may be obtained at http://ncsx.pppl.gov//index.html. Information about PPPL and its research programs may be obtained at www.pppl.gov.

Statement of Work for the Gypsy Moth (+) Disparlure String Dispenser 

Background

Gypsy moth pheromone dispensers are used in traps to detect infestation outside of generally infested areas. Once an infestation has been detected, a grid of traps (from 16 to 49 traps per square mile) is used to delimit the area of infestation. Although the number of the traps used in detection survey can be fairly well predicted from year-to-year, the use for delimiting will vary.

Pheromone dispensers are also used for mass trapping as a control measure. This technique uses nine traps per acre, usage rates for this purpose varies. In addition pheromone dispensers are used to monitor populations in and along the edge of the generally infested area.

Specifications — Standard Life (+) Disparlure PVC String Dispensers

The PVC string dispensers are constructed of twisted nylon twine, coated with a mixture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and (+) disparlure (0.6 % by weight).

Dispensers provided under this contract are subject to first article approval — Government testing using laboratory and field bioassays before effecting delivery. The dispensers shall fully satisfy specifications; and specifically, the following criteria in USDA conducted aging tests.

Standard life dispensers shall provide an initial release rate of 100-200 ng/hr and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of aging in a greenhouse (average temperature of 32 degrees centigrade), they will have a release rate of> 30 ng/hr. The method describe by Leonhardt et al 1990 shall be used to measure release rates in the laboratory at a constant temperature of 35 degrees centigrade. The average residual (+) disparlure content of dispensers shall be at least 100 ug of (+) disparlure after 12 weeks of greenhouse aging. Data for emission rates and residual contents shall be developed on at least 10 replicate dispensers produced using the same process and equipment the manufacturer intend to use for the production run.

Standard life PVC string design dispensers shall be constructed of multi-stranded nylon twine (1.5 mm diam X 14 to 16 cm long) coated with a mixture of PVC (+) disparlure (6.9 ul or (+) disparlure per gram of liquid PVC by weight). The total loading (+) disparlure concentration on the coated twine will be approximately 33 ug/cm of string length. Pages will contain the date of manufacture. Construction should be such that previously describe release rate and residual content specification are met

Specification for (+) disparlure	(cis-7, 8-epoxy-2 methyloctadecane)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

STATEMENT OF WORK
FOR 
ALTERNATE WATER SOURCE ASSESSMENT 
ON 
RANDOLPH AIR FORCE BASE TX

Randolph Air Force Base (RAFB) is exploring the feasibility to use the Leona Formation underlying the base as an alternate water source for non-potable water uses to reduce RAFB’s impact on water withdrawn from the Edwards Aquifer, a state-regulated groundwater source. The primary reasons for this initiative are to demonstrate by-action that RAFB is a good environmental steward by conserving a natural resource, i,e., potable groundwater and United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) – the Edwards Aquifer from over-withdrawal and protecting critical habitats for federally listed endangered species dependent on the Edwards Aquifer. RAFB like other Department of Defense installations in the Bexar County that use the Edwards Aquifer are under a United States Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinion are required to identify non-Edwards Aquifer alternate groundwater sources to reduce regional impacts on the Edwards Aquifer.

Additionally, RAFB currently receives reclaimed water, an alternated non-Edwards Aquifer source of water provided from the Cibolo Creek Management Authority (CCMA) and currently being primarily used for irrigation of the base golf course. This reclaimed water is currently provided to the base free of charge due to the initial agreement between the base and CCMA; however, in the near future CCMA will be charging RAFB for this water. The major concern with this reclaimed water is the “quality” of the water and the use restrictions associated with the water. 

Therefore, future availability and water quality restrictions, RAFB is initiating a study to determine the feasibility, accessibility, and the production potential of the Leona Formation, underlying the base to meet some or all of the base’s non-potable water requirements, i.e., washing aircraft and ground vehicle, irrigation, contractor requirements, etc. RAFB is attempting to identify productive shallow non-Edwards Aquifer ground water sources that can be inexpensively developed as alternate sources of water for non-potable water uses on base. 

This statement of work is to conduct a study to locate suitable locations on the base at which water wells could be installed from which to withdraw water from the underlying Leona Formation, store it in localized tanks for irrigation use, use by contractors, use for aircraft/vehicle wash racks. Aboveground storage may be required depending on the productivity of the well and its’ location. Information gathered during this study would allow RAFB to convert existing wells, drill larger wells in specified locations, and install storage tanks, as required. 

This statement of work is divided into the following several sections to identify the work to be accomplished in identifying potential locations to place “production” wells on base.

      ·     Historical Data Search and Review (e.g. previous groundwater studies/monitor 
             well logs from uncontaminated wells, etc.)

      ·     Field Studies to Confirm Historical Data (e.g. spring flow studies)

      ·     Monitor Well/Observation Well Installations

      ·     Monitor Well Pump Tests to Determine Productivity 

      ·     Written Report to Include Findings and Recommendations

Historical Data Search and Review 

The contractor will have access to existing data from previous ground water studies
preformed on the base as well as available monitor well information for review. This 
data can be used to better understand the water bearing areas of the base. The cumulative rainfall rates since 1993 can be used in evaluating groundwater levels in existing monitor wells on base. The contractor should review seismic data and maps compiled over the 
last 10 years will assist in understanding the subsurface topography directly related to 
water bearing areas on the base. Two seismic studies conducted in 1993 (golf course 
area) and 1995 (fire training area) by Extra Environmental, Inc (EEI) will be made
available. Additionally, EEI conducted a Mass Balancing study in 1994, which may 
provide useful information in determining the ground water availability and productivity.

Field Studies to Confirm Historical Data

The contractor will use available historical data as a base line to determine potential sites constructing tests wells into the Leona Formation. Field studies will be conducted to verify the accuracy of existing data and improve the contractor’s accuracy in determining potential well sites.

Monitor Well/Observation Well Installation

Based on the data gathered during the review of historical data and conducting field studies, the contractor will proposed suitable locations for the instalation of monitor and possibly observation wells. The contractor will also develop and sample water obtained from these wells for water quality and contamination. Existing wells that may be suitable for this study may also be tested for water quality and contamination if they are occur in a suitable location and appear to have adequate production capability. The number of  monitor/observation wells will be determined by the base, but will not exceed four. 
Monitor Well Pump Test to Determine Productivity 

Newly installed monitore wells as well as a select few existing monitor wells will be subjected to pump tests to prove or disprove their ability to supply water for irrigation, construction or wash racks. Pump test will be run at different lengths and at different pumping rates depending on the size, depth and location of the well. Discharged water will be allowed to flow into the nearest storm water drain to minimize any mess created by the test. This is one reason all potential test wells will be sample for laboratory analysis.

Written Report to Include Findings and Recommendations 

After the completition of all research and fieldwork, a formal written report will be composed. The report will include the results of all laboratory testing, pump testing, bore hole logs, maps and proposals or recommendations on which wells will produce sufficient water for irrigation, construction, etc. This project will by no means cover the entire base, but instead will be restricted to those areas where previous data exists in order to gain the most usable information for the cost of the project. This project will basically be centered around the southern half of the base exept where there is data suggesting uncontaminated shallow groundwater on other parts of the base. All reports, maps, etc will also be delivered on electronic media.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to modify and add to the combined synopsis/solicitation posted to FedBizOpps on February 1, 2005. The following changes are made to the solicitation:

1) The following statement is added: All hotel facilities provided by the vendor must be approved as fire safe by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

2) Clause (b)(23)(i) is added to the list of additional FAR clauses cited in the clause 52.212-5, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

3) The following clauses are added to the solicitation:

52.252-6  AUTHORIZED DEVIATIONS IN CLAUSES. (Apr 1984)

(a) The use in this solicitation or contract of any federal acquisition regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(deviation)"  after the date of the clause.

(b) The use in this solicitation or contract of any [insert regulation name] (48 CFR[ ]) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(deviation)" after the name of the regulation.

52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Oct 2003) --Tailored.

This clause, 52.212-4 is tailored as follows.  Paragraph (t), Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is deleted in its entirety.  In lieu of  Paragraph (t), contractors shall follow the requirements in the Clause 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003)- Deviation, which is incorporated in full text as an Addendum/Attachment to this order.

52.204-7  CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (Oct 2003)- DEVIATION

SSA is in the process of establishing the necessary interface between its financial system and the CCR database.  During this transition period, the agency is going to temporarily deviate from the requirement to use the CCR database as its source of information for EFT payments.  Therefore, this contract includes the clause at 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other than Central Contractor Registration (May 1999) in lieu of the clause at FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003).  This is the only deviation from the requirements of this clause, 52.204-7.  The contractor shall comply with all other requirements for CCR registration in the clause.

This clause, 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) is revised to reflect this deviation.  The revised sections are shaded.

	(a)  Definitions.  As used in this clause—

	Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.

	Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. 
	
Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by (D&B) plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.  (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.)  This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.
	
Registered in the CCR database means that–
