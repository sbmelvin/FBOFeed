<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This pre-solicitation announcement constitutes a Notice of Contracting Action (NOCA) issued by the 551st Electronics Systems Group, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2115.  The Air Force intends to issue a contract to  Northrop Grumman Corporation, Linthicum Heights, MD, pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) (One Responsible Source And No Other Supplies Will Satisfy Agency Requirements) authorized under 10  U.S.C 2304-(c)1.
This Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Sole Source procurement will be for the following items: Dispenser Cathode Wide Band Klystron Power Amplifier (WBKPA) Kits (P/N 139K703G01) five (5) each, and Dispenser Cathode WBKPA tubes (P/N 587R258H02) five (5) each for the Royal Saudi Air Force.  These supplies will require radar system level verification testing to ensure successful integration between the Dispenser Cathode WBKPA kits/tubes and the AWACS Aircraft radar hardware and software.  The Government anticipates  Northrop Grumman Corporation, Linthicum, MD will be the prime integrator for this activity and L3 Communications, San Carlo, CA will serve in a subcontractor capacity. In addition to the above Royal Saudi Air Force requirements, this sole source procurement may include contract options for the following future FMS requirements:
	-Four (4) WBKPA Kits	-Three (3) WBKPA Tubes-Software upgrade to the AWACS Aircraft Surveillance Radar Computer Program (SRCP) to    ensure 	compatibility with WBKPA (Automatic Phase Compensation Calibration software change)	-Firmware upgrade to the Transmit Microwave Assembly (P/N 792R196G02) to ensure 	compatibility with WBKPA (Reprogramming of PROMs with new Phase Compensation Curves)	-Installation and checkout at FMS customer location	-Develop and deliver Full Redundancy software change for SRCP
This is a follow-on procurement to the USAF WBKPA Production Contract (FA8704-04-C-0003).  The Government has determined that an award to any source other than Northrop Grumman and L3 Communications would result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governments FMS requirements.  This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Further this notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  Please direct any questions concerning this notice to the attention of David H. Hawkins, Contracting Officer, 551st ELSG/PK, 3 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2115, Phone Number 781-377-8357;  email to david.hawkins@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE NOTICE: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 0800 MST Monday, 27 Nov 06 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon Telos Corporation being the only manufacturer/vendor able to satisfy this requirement:
Product upgrades, telephone help desk service, telephonic system engineering support and maintenance site visits for Telos Contractor Automated Message Handling System at HQ NORTHCOM, Peterson AFB, CO.  This requirement is considered a follow on contract for the continued development of the AMHS system already in place.  Additionally, USNORTHCOM has made a significant investment in AMHS and replacing the current system would result in a significant duplication of cost.

<DESC>The subject add-on requirement is for the acquisition of 9 NSNs that are transportation equipment items with various item descriptions and end items. The solicitation is unrestricted with other than full and open competition and is being issued pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304 ( c ) ( 1 ) and contemplates the award of a contract for items of supply that are available from only one responsible source.  Currently GDLS-Canada (56161) is the only known responsible source. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery, and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. FOB destination is required and inspection/acceptance is at origin.  The long term contract supports requirements for stock replenishment only. The material groups for the add-on project are: 2510, 5310, 5330, 5340, and 6680. The items will be added onto existing corporate long term contract, SPM7LX-08-D-7028 for the remaining time left on the basic contract. Option period one was exercised in April 2009, which means that the remaining time left on the long term contract is a little less than four years. The final expiration of the long term contract is April 2013. The small business size standard is 750. Hard copies of the solicitation are not available and there are no drawings available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive, technical data, therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 USC 2304 ( c ) (1). See numbered notes 22 and 26.  The solicitation is based on an estimated total dollar amount of $620,000. The nsn list is as follows:

This requirement is to provide forward site support services for first responder personnel in the Federal Emergency Management Agency, during disaster operations such as hurricanes and earthquakes.  While this forward site support concept applies primarily to disaster situations in the continental US when there is preparation time (e.g. hurricanes), it can also be adapted to no-notice incidents (earthquakes, terrorism), or locations outside the continental United States.  

Requirements are for the following support services:

•	Mobile food service (meal preparation)
•	Mobile toilets (porta-potties)
•	Mobile shower facility
•	Mobile laundry facility
•	Potable water tanker for decontamination of first responders

During an actual incident all, some, or none of the services listed above may be required, depending on the state of the infrastructure, availability of facilities, extent of damage etc.   Based on requirements multiple awards to contractors may be made to provide first responders needed services.
 
The largest contingent of customers serviced under this contract will be first responders performing the search and rescue operations during the initial phases of disaster response.  In addition forward site occupants may include incident management leadership teams, emergency management personnel, and other first responders.

The disaster environment under which these services are to be provided is very austere, and it is assumed that the stricken area will have little or no operating infrastructure.  Accordingly, contactors are required to be totally self-sufficient in terms of providing specialized transport/storage capacity for their primary mission (e.g. field kitchens, showers), potable water storage, black/grey water storage/removal/disposal/dump fees, electric power, fuel for needed operations (e.g. vehicles and generators), sleeping quarters for contractor personnel, and solid waste disposal.

The services to be provided are different from those normally associated with base camps established by FEMA during the Recovery phase.   The forward operating sites envisioned by this Statement of Work are typically located at or near harm’s way (hot zones), close to areas most stricken by the incident.   The sites are activated early – hours, not days after the incident occurs.  Once activated, the forward sites are generally short term (usually ten days or less) since the lifesaving mission of search and rescue is short and time-sensitive.   In addition the number of personnel receiving services is generally smaller than those of a long term Recovery base camp.   Forward operating sites involve mobile, flexible, scalable functions.   Contractors should be able to set up and tear down operations in less than six hours.  Several services normally required under a site operation such as lodging and medical support are not required at forward sites.  In addition the Government will provide site security services.   

The contractor is expected to provide all necessary labor, supervision, equipment, tools, materials, and supplies necessary to provide the items and services described herein.  These emergency services shall include (but are not limited to) complete management, control, purchase, receipt, storage, issue, handling, processing, clean up, transport, repair, and maintenance. The Contractor shall have sufficient staffing capabilities and trained specialists to professionally set-up, operate and manage site operations. The Contractor is expected to be able to expand or reduce assets (equipment) rapidly based on changing mission needs and site population.  The Contractor shall have sufficient equipment readily available for rapid deployment, and preventive maintenance programs to ensure optimum readiness levels at all times.

The government intends to award multiple Time & Material (T&M)/Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Hybrid type Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA).  In addition, in awarding this contract, the government will use the procedures established in FAR Part 12 and 15.  It is anticipated that the period of performance will be for one base year plus four one-year option periods.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  

Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for the release of the solicitation and any amendments that may follow.  The final RFP should be available for downloading on or about fifteen (15) days after publication of this announcement.  Requests for hard copy of the solicitation may be made via email at lilian.hutchinson@dhs.gov.  Offerors are cautioned to include the Solicitation Number HSFEHQ-09-R-0080 on all documentation submitted in response to this requirement.  Written technical proposals and business proposals will be required approximately 30 days following the RFP issue date.

Contract award will be based on best-value tradeoff analysis that will result in best value to the Government where technical merit is significantly more important than price.  The estimated award is 15 September 2009 subject to FAR 52.232-19 Availability of Funds.  The Interested Vendors List (IVL) feature has been activated on the Vendors portal to FedBizOpps, and firms are encouraged to provide their contact information in the portal to help maximize teaming arrangements.

<DESC>Project Details:  This project provides pavement preservation of the paved surfaces in the North Rim Section of Grand Canyon National Park.  Grand Canyon National Park is located in Coconino County of Arizona in the northwest portion of Arizona.  

Option X of this Project provides for the preservation of the South Rim portion of Grand Canyon National Park.  Currently, funds are not available for this portion of the work.  This option should be held open for 60 days pending the availability of funds.      

The preservation treatments being used are chip seals and modified slurry seals.  Other construction applications used on a lesser scale are pavement patching, crack sealing and pavement markings.

The North Rim Project, Schedule A, has approximately 430,000 square yard of chip seal and 70,000 square yards of modified slurry seal.  Included in the Project will be approximately 450 square yards of pavement patching in locations designated by the Project Engineer prior to placement of the preservation treatments. 

The work on the South Rim, if funded, includes 725,000 square yards of chip seals and 359,000 square yards of modified slurry seals.  This work would also include approximately 8,000 square yards of pavement patching.   

This project uses American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds.  Advertisement is anticipated mid-July 2009.  The contracting range for this project (considering the schedule and each option) is between $2 million and $11 million.

<DESC>RECOVERY – THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY

This notice is NOT a notice for the soliciation of offers.

Using Recovery Act funding, the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Assisted Acquisition Service (AAS) intends to modify existing GSA Task Number FY758001T6, a competitively awarded, Time and Materials Task Order under GSA Schedule 70 for the operations and maintenance of the Indian Health Services (IHS) Information Technology infrastructure.  The incumbent contractor is Chickasaw Nation Industries, a Native American owned 8A Small Disadvantaged Business headquartered in Norman, Oklahoma.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the Task Order.  

This existing contract must be used because the additional requirements are within the scope of the original award and for efficiency and economy the Government’s best interest would be served.  

Specific requirements include:

Task 1 Project Overview – Remote Access Security Improvement

Task 2 Project Overview – RPMS Secure Telnet Implementation

Task 3 Project Overview – Domain Controller Upgrade

Task 4 Project Overview – Router Upgrade

Task 5 Project Overview - SAN Improvement

Task 6 Project Overview – Asset and Patch Management Improvement


The requirements of this modification are included in the Projects and Activities section of the IHS Health Information Technology Recovery Plan listed here:

•	Telehealth and Network Infrastructure.  The telehealth and network infrastructure activity is comprised of a number of discrete projects. All of these projects are related to improvements to the IHS network or support of future telehealth initiatives. These projects include a complete upgrade of the network routers, upgrade of network domain controllers, improvement and expansion of the storage area network, network security improvements; installation of an emergency diesel generator for data center backup power, and upgrade and expansion of video conferencing infrastructure and the purchase of video conference devices for provision of telehealth services.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act Funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and the maximum extent practicable, making Fixed Price (FP) awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although GSA’s Task Order was not awarded as an FP contract, it was awarded competitively and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance given the specific requirements.  The existing contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government’s risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, modification of this existing Task order is the most appropriate method to accomplish the work anticipated.

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to establish a collaborative project with qualified organization(s) to develop and perform predictive in vitro dissolution/release test methods.  

The purpose of this contract is to establish a collaborative project with qualified organization(s) to develop and perform predictive in vitro dissolution/release test methods that can be applicable for poorly soluble drugs, and guide in vitro and in vivo studies conducted for APIs with similar solubility characteristics under typical (standard) conditions and under “altered” conditions reflecting unique patient characteristics. 

The developed dissolution/release testing paradigms, incorporating drug product and dosage form characteristics for oral dosage forms, should be reliable, transferable to similar products, and clinically meaningful (predictive) throughout the lifecycle of the product. 

Furthermore, while addressing existing concerns, the approaches explored will bring in new knowledge, and it is intended that the findings from this project (with necessary extensions), will lead to in vitro dissolution/release testing paradigms for a large group of drug products. 

The work under this contract involves preparation of a study protocol that will describe the rationale in selection of the study drugs (will be referred to as model drugs), methods (such as methods used for data collection and possible additional exploratory approaches, data storage and data analyses) and reporting and communication of results.  The subsections of the study protocol and the required information are described as follows.  The study protocol will guide the research so it will be completed prior to initiation of the experimental work.  During conduct of research, if revisions to the protocol are needed, such as incorporating additional analyses, the supporting rationale and methodology will be described and added to the study protocol as amendments.   The study protocol will serve as the overall plan for the research program with details supporting key decision steps.  

The anticipated award type is a firm fixed price contract for Five (5) Years; One Base Year with Four Option Year.  This contract will be full and open competition.  The contract will be awarded best value (lowest price, technically acceptable).

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) code is 541690- Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.

All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract.  The website is www.ccr.gov.  

This announcement is not an RFQ.  Interested parties shall submit an email to Tara.Hobson@hhs.fda.gov to request a copy of the solicitation.  The release of the solicitation will be on or about May 1, 2009.  The response date will be on or about June 1, 2009.

<CONTACT>Tara R. Hobson, Contract Specialist, Phone 3018279691, Fax 3018277101, Email Tara.Hobson@fda.hhs.gov - Doreen Williams , Team Lead , Phone 301-827-3366, Fax 301-827-7106, Email doreen.williams@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit a contract for the project, “Approach to the Understanding and Predicting Excipient Properties and Functionality”.

The ultimate goal of this project is to establish an information system that is used to maintain values of fundamental pharmaceutical excipient material properties, and which contains models, best practices, and methods for using this data in the systematic design of pharmaceutical products and processes.  This system will be publicly accessible in order to improve the efficacy, quality, and efficiency of manufacturer’s products, and improve the science for establishing industry guidances. Physical property databases for various material classes are common in other fields of engineering; for example, there are many databases of material properties on the NIST website .  These standardized and reliable material properties are indispensable to an engineer who is designing an industrial product and process.  Currently, there are no such databases for the physical properties of pharmaceutical excipients.

Scope of Work:

The proposed work is the first part of a larger program to identify, measure, and provide useful models for predicting excipient properties that affect the performance of solid dosage formulations.  The current proposal focuses on materials from three excipient classes used in virtually all immediate release direct compression tablet manufacturing.  They include a binder/diluent such as microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), lactose and dibasic calcium phosphate, a disintegrant such as Na starch glycolate or pregelatinized starch and a lubricant such as magnesium stearate (MgSt).  These three excipients are the most commonly used filler/binders used in direct compression formulations, and they span the range from very ductile to very brittle materials.

The anticipated contract type is a labor hour for two years, one (1) Base Year and one (1) Option Year.  This will be a full and open competition solicitation.  This contract will be awarded on a best value basis.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611310.

All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract.  The website is http://www.ccr.gov.   This announcement is not an RFQ.  Interested parties shall submit an email to request the solicitation at Tara.Hobson@fda.hhs.gov.

TTTech is currently the only vendor of TTE until such time as TTE becomes aSociety of Automotive Engineers standard AS6802, an event that is not expected for atleast another year. This proprietary commercial off the shelf data bus hardware will beused in the developmental system that was previously purchased on Contract NNC08QA28Pfrom TTTech.The urgency is that the Orion Preliminary Design Review (PDR) is in late August and thedata bus hardware will enhance our ability to perform Independent Verification andValidation on the TTE data bus before the PDR.	NASA will use this system to do properinsight or oversight of the development of the Orion data bus.	2.

There is a limit of 4people per company for the Technology Demo and 3 people for the site tours.  Visitorsnames need to be submitted to Jonathon D. Wingerberg at Jonathon.D.Wingerberg@nasa.gov nolater than July 6, 2009.   All visitors must be U.S citizens, without dual citizenships.A separate SGSS RFP Industry day will be held approximately 1 week after release of thedraft RFP to address RFP topics.SN Technology Day  July 14, 2009Site visit @ WSC  July 15, 2009Industry day (WSC or GSFC)  1 week after draft RFPNotice 2:  WSC questions.Please submit questions that you would like to ask the WSC personnel by July 6, 2009. The questions and the answers to all submitted questions (unattributed) will bedistributed to all Industry visitors during the site visit.Question 1:  Workmanship StandardsLegacy SN documentation specified a variety of ground station electrical workmanshipstandards (e.g., STDN Spec-4, STDN Spec-6, STDN Spec-7, STDN Spec-8). Thesespecifications are out of date. Current NASA and GSFC workmanship standards focus heavilyon spaceflight equipment. Workmanship standards applied to the SGSS Project must considerthe environmental conditions of the various sites (e.g., seismic zones forWSC and Guam, hurricane issues at Guam). What impact would specification of industrystandards such as the Telcordia standards vs. imposing NASA-developed specifications haveon the effort? Are there other comparable industry standards that should be considered?Prospective offerors are invited to submit written responses to the above Notices andQuestion to: Jonathon D. Wingerberg at Jonathon.D.Wingerberg@nasa.gov or via facsimiletransmission at (301) 286-6299, no later than July 6, 2009.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Ordela, Inc. in Oak Ridge, TN for refurbishment of an Ordela neutron detector, Model 2660N.

Ordela, Inc. makes the neutron detectors used on multiple neutron scattering instruments at the NIST Center for Neutron Research. The largest specialized detectors made by Ordela that are in use at the NCNR are two-dimensional detectors used on the two Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) instruments. These detectors require periodic refurbishment and/or repair. The two-dimensional neutron detector installed on the NG3 SANS instrument is in need of refurbishment. The refurbishment consists of replacing damaged or worn components and recalibrating the instrument back to its original specification. The detector is a proprietary instrument that was developed, manufactured, and sold by Ordela, Inc.  As the original manufacturer, Ordela is equipped for and experienced in the repair and refurbishment of these detectors. Because of its proprietary nature, Ordela is the only vendor with access to a complete schematic of the detector. Without access to the schematic, the ability to repair and calibrate are limited. Any attempt to refurbish the unit without the schematic could lead to further damage, resulting in added cost.

The refurbishment will include the purchase of 65 liters of Helium-3 gas which is used in these detectors for proper operation.  It is required that the gas be purchased as part of the refurbishment from Ordela, Inc. as Ordela, Inc. will not warrant any repairs under any circumstances if they do not supply the Helium as the purity of the gas is so critical (99.999%) that a detector may function properly for initial testing only and then soon thereafter fail due to contaminants in the Helium-3 gas. The impact due to failure of a detector is detrimental to the Center for Neutron Research due to the fact a whole Neutron Scattering Instrument is unavailable for use until it is repaired.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 45 days after receipt of order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 6, 2009.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>ABI has developed microfluidic technology in a 384-well plate format that is compatible with real-time PCR to provide comprehensive coverage of all identified human miRNAs in the Sanger miRBase v10 database (a total of 667 miRNAs).  ABI's two-card set of TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays (Arrays A and B) evaluate a total of 667 unique human miRNAs using state-of-the-art gold standard real-time PCR assays with extraordinary sensitivity and specificity over a very wide dynamic range (greater than 6 logs) and using as little as 1ng of RNA.  In addition to the superb accuracy of these miRNA assays, ABI's array cards permit the analysis of all 667 miRNAs in a little as 5 hours (as opposed to individual real-time PCR assays of all 667 miRNAs, which would require several weeks).</p>
<p>The ABI 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System is the only known real-time PCR system that is compatible with the 7900HT TaqMan Low Density Array block required to run the TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays, which permit the analysis of 384 miRNAs simultaneously and provide the high throughput work flow required for this project.<br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) intends to negotiate on behalf of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) to award a sole source purchase order, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), to V-Soft Communications, LLC of Cedar Falls, IA, to purchase an upgrade to the Government owned Probe V-Soft mapping system version 4. In addition to the software upgrade the Government intends to purchase technical support services.
<p>This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with policies and procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items, and Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they can meet the Agency's requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating their technical capabilities. To be considered an affirmative response, all responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements. In your response you must provide sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement based on the below narrative. Failure to submit documentation will result in the agency proceeding as stated above. The estimated value of this proposed procurement is $14,798.86.</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE NARRATIVE:</p>
<p>The Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) has yearly grant competitions for its programs, the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) and the Low-Power Television Conversion and Upgrade Programs. Both programs prepare maps showing the coverage of radio and television stations of its applicants.</p>
<p>The Probe 4, is a proprietary software mapping system owned and created by V-Soft Communications, LLC. There are no other known manufacturers of this software product. OTIA uses a mapping application to enable the programs to calculate the coverage and population served to over 7,000 radio and television station in the United States. The mapping applications interacts and retrieves data from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The creation of maps is essential to the daily operations of both programs.</p>
<p>The mapping system enables the staff to more effectively assess the merits of the proposals. Along with the mapping system, technical support is to be provided:<br />System availability - 90% of the time; Internet Updates ;access to a toll free telephone; FM radio daily downloads available; Television daily downloads available; and access to various databases.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be for one (1) year, with technical support available 90% of the time of the time. The contractor shall provide a response time of less than one minute; and system must be able to process up to 100 applications per day.</p>
<p>Currently, the Government has only one (one) license and one (1) workstation in operation to compute propagation studies and maps of broadcast facilities. Both the public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) And the Low-Power Television and Translator Program (LPTV) utilize these maps in the daily operation of their respective programs. The LPTV program has created over 10,000 maps of the Low-Power television stations in the United States. The V-Soft Probe-2 mapping program was originally purchased to utilize and to perform the PTFP Public Radio Coverage Study. In 2008, the upgrade to Probe-3 was purchased. The upgrade to Probe 4, is needed and requires essential upgrades which were not available with the previous versions.</p>
<p>The mapping system operates as a separate workstation and is not permanently connected to the HCHB system. Back-up is manual and copied to discs. The system requires web capability to retrieve updated FCC data from the FCC web site, and is updated as required.</p>
<p>The second license will allow for two (2) simultaneous operations as well as complete compatibility and redundancy for the mapping operations should the current workstation fail. The software mapping program is too large for operation on the office computers used by Government staff. The program performs extensive mathematical computations and draws extensive maps.</p>
<p>While other mapping programs are available, they are not compatible with maps and documents compiled by the V-Soft program. With data for several thousand maps previously completed it is essential that the current program and method be retained. Having different formats on two (2) work stations would not allow for interchange and would double the complication should a problem arise. The Probe 4 Update will regenerate any data created with previous versions of Probe and would provide complete redundancy and back-up for the original workstation.</p>
<p>Submit written responses by July 6, 2009 at 12:00 EST, via email to James.Webb@noaa.gov. Reference Solicitation No. DG1335-09-RQ-128 in the subject line of your email response.</p>

<DESC>GENERAL CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This is a pre-solicitation notice to be issued as a request for proposal of a government requirement.  NAICS Code will be 236220 and the size standard is $33,500,000.  This acquisition is 100% set-aside for certified Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns.  HUBZone small businesses (including joint ventures) desiring to propose on this project are reminded they must appear on the Small Business Administration's list of Qualified HUBZone small business concerns on its internet website at http://www.sba.gov/hubzone as of the date/time when proposals will be due.  Proposals received from other than certified HUBZone small business concerns will be rejected and will not be evaluated for the work contemplated under this acquisition.
The procurement will be conducted utilizing source selection procedures via the trade-off process under the best value continuum.  The award will be based upon the best value to the government considering tradeoffs between price and non-price related factors.  Potential offerors must refer to the solicitation (when issued) for the selection criteria/factors to be evaluated by the government since they are subject to change.  Some examples of evaluation/selection factors/criteria that may be used are as follows:  a) Specialized Experience; b) Past Performance; c) Familiarity and Experience with Construction in Remote Alaskan Sites; and d) Proposed Project Management and Operating Procedures for this Contract.  The non-price evaluation factors will be approximately equal in importance to that of the evaluated price.  The estimated range of this project is $1,000,000 - $3,000,000.  The government intends to award a contract without conducting discussions with the potential contractors.  This project is subject to the Davis Bacon Act and the resulting wage determination will be incorporated into any executed instrument.  Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price.  Funds are available for the proposed action, however, if the project is cancelled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror.  Responders are advised that the requirement(s) may be delayed, cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation, and/or final award process based on decisions related to DOI and NPS changes.  Contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) government system prior to award to be eligible for a government contract - the link can be found at http://www.ccr.gov/ -- we advise potential offerors to begin the registration process when they prepare their proposal to ensure the registration in the CCR database is complete and in-place should they be selected for the award.  In the event an offeror is not registered in CCR at the time the contracting officer is ready to award the contract, the contracting officer will proceed to the next eligible successful offeror registered in the CCR database.  Refer to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, "If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  Joint Ventures are encouraged to submit a proposal, however; offerors submitting a proposal as a Joint Venture should remember that Joint Ventures must also be registered in CCR identical to the joint venture indicated in their proposal (failure to do so will make the offeror[s] ineligible for award).  The anticipated posting date to the NBC and Federal Business Opportunities Website (solicitation number N991709A013) will be on or about July 22, 2009 (subject to change) and proposals will be due on or about August 21, 2009 (subject to change).  The solicitation (and subsequent amendments if applicable) and all related documents can be downloaded electronically (once posted) from the DOI NBC Website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov/ AND the National Park Service Public ftp site (which will contain the larger files such as pictures, drawings, specifications, etc.).

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  The site of the work for the resulting contract is approximately 1 mile south-southwest of Brooks Camp, in Katmai National Park and Preserve, Alaska.  The nearest community outside the park is King Salmon, Alaska, approximately 30 miles from the work site and 290 air miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska.
Water levels in Naknek Lake and the Naknek River are subject to seasonal fluctuations such that water travel from Lake Camp to Brooks Camp can be severely limited.  Typically, barge transport to Brooks is only possible from late June through October.  Winter ice may be thick enough to allow winter transport to the site, but cannot be relied upon consistently year to year.
Regularly scheduled commercial jet service links King Salmon to Anchorage, with several air charter options available.  Air service to Brooks Camp is limited to small float plane.  There is no developed landing strip.  There is no road access from Anchorage and beyond to King Salmon/Naknek, and there is no road access of any type from outside the park to Brooks Camp or the job site.  The site should be considered EXTEREMELY rugged and remote.

<DESC>The contracted  Vessel shall support the following activities:Operations shall be conducted in Dry Tortugas National Park near 24.5 degrees North, and 083.0 degrees West.
Biological data will be collected by SCUBA divers using non-destructive, in situ, fishery independent visual monitoring methods.  The scientific investigators are uniquely qualified to conduct this research base on past research and experience in the study area.  The proposed sampling survey will obtain about 500 visual census point samples over a short period to provide a spatially integrated "snapshot" of the exploited reef fish community four years after the area was impacted by several hurricanes and two years after the no-take marine reserve 'Research Natural Area' was implemented in Dry Tortugas National Park.  This work requires a labor-intensive effort with no shortcuts to ensure that sampling is cost-effective and precise.  At a rate of 4-6 reef fish visual census samples per diver day (depending on depth), 10 field days of ship support are required to provide sufficient spatial coverage of the park.  By sampling both in and out of the new marine reserve, science divers will provide: (1) spatially explicit estimates of population abundance and biomass by sizs (age) groups for both exploited and non exploited species essential for quantitative stock assessments; (2) statistical characterization reef "habitats" in terms of nursery and polulation productivity value; and(3) critical data with which to begin to evaluate the effectiveness of the new no-take marine reserve.

The Contractor is required to provide a residential executive-level education program geared to the needs o! f mid-grade Naval Officers and NAVSEA civilian counterparts, so as to allow them to understand the operation and workings of American business. The CLP will encompass a series of academic coursework in the areas of leadership, strategic management and communications, globalization and national security, and public management practices. The length of individual coursework will range from three (3) to ten (10) consecutive days of instruction based on subject content. NAVSEA will require an annual CLP program deployment to conclude within 26 months. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on the Navy Electronic Commerce Site (NECO) in the near future.

Rating: Voltage, 25kV Max (insulation and jacket);  Current, 300kA Max (pulse).  Cable rolls to be a minimum of 500 feet.  An extensive market survey was performed and shows that Dielectric is the only vendor that has the capability of meeting size and power requirements.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>PROJECT: RECOVERY. GSA Solicitation for Construction Manager as Agent for the Modernization of the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building, Denver, Colorado. GSA will be using funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for this project.<br />BUILDING TYPE: Federal Office Building <br />CLIENT AGENCY: General Services Administration - Region 8 Offices<br />SIZE: 494,156 gsf<br />PARKING SPACES: 168<br />BUDGET: Estimated Construction Cost is between $100,000,000 and $125,000,000</p>
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for performance of Construction Manager Services for the Modernization of the Byron Rogers Federal Building in Denver, Colorado. The Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building is located at 1961 Stout Street in the central business district of Denver, Colorado. This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation's most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 - 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values.</p>
<p>As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required. Projects in or affecting historic properties must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This facility must be designed in metric units.</p>
<p>The design and construction of this project will be delivered through the Design-Build delivery method under separate contract.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The project consists of a major modernization upgrade project for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building (FB) and a window replacement project for the adjacent Byron G. Rogers U.S. Courthouse. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The FB occupies a prominent position in the Federal District of downtown Denver. It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 18 stories and a basement. The FB contains 494,156 gross square feet (GSF), 437,551 rentable square feet (RSF), and 329,433 usable square feet (USF). The current FB tenants will be relocated prior to the start of the modernization project. Agencies to be located in the federal building will be the Commission on Civil Rights, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Social Security Administration, and the General Services Administration.<br />The courthouse is a multi-tenant office and court building. It is five stories high with a basement and subbasement connected to the FB by a two story section. This section contains building services, a loading dock, and a two lane ramp to the parking garage. The courthouse houses six major tenants including United States District Court, Court Administrative Support Center, Probation and Pre-Trial Services, U.S. 10th Circuit Library, 10th Circuit Mediation and the United States Marshals Service. The building is approximately 248,000 GSF including two levels of underground parking spaces within the basement and sub-basement. A comprehensive modernization project for the courthouse was completed in 2005. The courthouse will remain occupied while the windows are replaced. The federal building and courthouse are located at 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado, 80294. Both buildings are long-term GSA-held assets situated in a prime location near downtown with public transportation within the central business district, in the Federal District of downtown Denver, with a stable tenant base and a high reinvestment need.</p>
<p>Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the tenants' existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. GSA requires all new construction, renovation, and modernization projects to be certified through the LEED program; owing to the historic significance of the building, all work will follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, Revised 1992 (36 CFR 67); upgrade the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; upgrade the mechanical piping, heating, and hot water systems; upgrade the electrical system and install new telecommunications infrastructure; modernize all elevators; remove all asbestos containing materials (ACMs); implement GSA's workplace procedures and achieve measurable effectiveness results; identify design strategies that work to optimize the project's access to energy from seasonal solar, natural lighting, and wind to reduce undesirable loads and maximize desirable loads to meet desired energy targets for the facility; upgrade by replacing all public and private restrooms, plumbing systems, and fixtures; upgrade building security; replace underground water and waste water service lines.</p>

<p>PROCUREMENT STRATEGY</p>
<p>The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Brooks Act Procurement, FAR Subpart 36.3, Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 36.303. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require contractor interviews/presentations at the Denver Federal Center, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>The RFQ will be issued electronically after 07/10/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan for acceptance by the Contracting Officer, at the Phase Two interviews/presentations, which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>

The application of a scale of words will be used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for criteria evaluation.  For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives.  Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level.  If at any level of indentation an Offers submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for a criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory), the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation.  Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level.  The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<BR><BR>(i) Outstanding  Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards.  The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.  Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  The offerors qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government.  The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract.  Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements.  There is a very high probability of success.<BR><BR>(ii) Above Average - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to exceed performance or capability standards.  Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.  The offerors qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements.  The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government.  The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements.  Disadvantages are minimal.  There is a high probability of success.<BR><BR>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral)  Information submitted demonstrate offerors potential to meet performance or capability standards.  The information represents an acceptable solution.  Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas.  A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved.  The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements.  No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral.  There is a good probability of success.<BR><BR>(iv) Marginal  The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement.  The offerors interpretation of the Governments requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient.  The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement criteria requirements.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall submittal rating.  The offerors qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government.  There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable.  There are significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>(v) Unsatisfactory  The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards.  Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal.  There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved.  The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Governments requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. There are very significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>5.

<DESC>RECOVERY--<BR>ACTUAL SITE:  National Training Center (NTC), Ft Irwin, California.<BR>Description:  The Philadelphia District, Corps of Engineers, is issuing a negotiated, best value RFP (Request for Proposal) acquisition under Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations to acquire a microgrid to replace spot generators with prime power generators, with some utility-like controls, set up as a power plant. This will require the successful offeror to first grid FOB Denver (located 1.0 hour from main NTC post, terrain-rough, with specific location to be determined, and establish the infrastructure. The power plant or microgrid will be configured for power to be delivered based on actual demand, not peak demand for the overall system. Design will allow for the future addition of renewable energy (solar, wind, and/or battery storage).  The selected offeror will be required to provide all necessary tools, materials, and equipment and qualified labor to install a 1MW power generation system connected to the grid, inclusive of underground cabling, step down and step up transformers, panel boxes as necessary as well as paralleling gear with load sequencing capabilities (turning on/off generators). The power distribution system or microgrid will provide 480vac, 208vac, and 110/120vac to meet all power requirements.  In order to be eligible for award, prices must be submitted on for all major components to each line item.  Failure to submit pricing detail for all major components/categories may cause rejection of the offer.  Proposals will be evaluated for completeness in satisfying the requirements of the RFP. The proposals will be ranked on the basis of the following factors: (a) past performance and experience, (b) technical ability (comprised of contractor submitted proprietary drawings, contractor furnished equipment/product listings/catalogs), (c) management plan, with locations of the offerors primary place of business and field offices, (d) mobilization/ set up schedule, (e) extent of subcontracting, and (f) price.  Technical ability is slightly more important than past performance and experience, mobilization/set-up schedules, both of which are of equal weight and more important than the extent of subcontracting.  The technical factors when combined are more important that price; however, price remains a significant factor. This is an unrestricted procurement.  The applicable NAICS code is 221119, with a size standard of 4 million megawatt hours, (a firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric energy for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours). The solicitation will be issued on, or about, 10 July 2009 with proposals due by 3:30 p.m., local time, 11 August 2009.  Hard copy quotes are to be delivered to the Corps of Engineers, Wanamaker Building, Room 643, 100 Penn Square East, Philadelphia, PA 19107-3390 ATTN: Mr. Edward A. Boddie.  Solicitation documents, plans and specifications will only be available via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) homepage located at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<a href="mailto:Angela.Deren@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, has a requirement for participation in the University of Maryland's Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (also known as MAX) project as stated in the below Sole Source Justification.  Solicitation VA-798A-09-RP-0197 is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  This requirement is being procured as a firm fixed price contract under FAR 12, Commercial Items.  The applicable NAICS code is 519130 and the size standard is 500 employees.  This solicitation is issued as unrestricted.  Proposals are due on June 29, 2009 at 5:00pm Central time.  Please note:  Contractor must be registered with Central Contractor Registration to be eligible for contract award or payment from a Federal Government entity.  Information on registration may be obtained by calling 1-800-334-3414 or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number from Dun & Bradstreet.  Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award.Justification for Full and Open CompetitionEach justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As required of FAR 6.302-3(c), each justification shall include the following information:  1.  Requesting Agency: 	Department of Veterans Affairs	Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology (005)  	810 Vermont Ave	Mail Stop  005OP3	Washington, DC 20420    Contracting activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs	CAI - Austin	1615 Woodward Street	Austin, TX 78772 2.  Nature and/or description of the action:   Participation in the Mid-Atlantic Crossroads advanced regional inter-networking project infrastructure to make advanced networking services available among networking participants.    3.  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):   1.	Participation fee for the period from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010.2.	Port connection at 1,000 mega bites per section for the period from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010.  4.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.    10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3)(B). FAR 6.302-3 (a)(2)(ii) To establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center 5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. Please provide a complete the description of all unique qualifications provided by MAX and Internet 2 to support the authority cited in the attached document.Internet2 is a consortium led by the higher education and research community in the U.S. that maintains an advanced high performance computer network.  Its focus is to provide leading-edge network capabilities to its members and unique partnership opportunities that facilitate the development, deployment, and use of revolutionary Internet technologies, such as the (OMB) mandated Internet protocol, IPv6. A unique qualification of the Internet2 network is that is fully supports the IPv6 protocol, and provides a testing bed for VA's implementation of this new technology.  Additionally, many of VA's academic affiliates as well as Federal agencies (e.g. National Institutes of Health) are members of the consortium.  Connecting to the Internet2 network allows computer network traffic between VA and these institutions to travel over Internet2 rather than traversing the Internet, and may improve traffic flow to/from the Internet.  Furthermore, the Internet2 network can support extremely large volumes of data transfer at very high speeds (1 Gigabit or more) not available over the commercial Internet and that may be required by increasingly sophisticated and specialized multimedia applications.  The consortium has projects and programs developing and testing these types of applications (e.g. telepresence) in several areas including education and healthcare.  Internet2 is also working with the Federal Communications Commission on the Federal Rural Healthcare Pilot Program, an enhanced funding initiative intended to help public and non-profit health care providers construct state- and region-wide broadband networks to provide telehealth and telemedicine services.  With other Federal agencies, such as Indian Health Services participating, this project may help VA improve delivery of remote healthcare services and enhance VA data sharing capabilities.Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (also known as MAX) is one of several research and education regional computer networking organizations across the country known as Internet2 connectors.  These organizations serve as network access points or conduits to the Internet2 network for Internet2 members and aggregate network traffic that is destined for Internet2 from various institutions in their local geographic area.   MAX is a special type of connector known as a Gigapop, or Gigabit Point of Presence.  It is one of several Gigapops across the country that specifically provides very high speed access (at least one gigabit per second - 1 Gbps) to the Internet2 network.   MAX provides this service to higher education, Federal agency, and non-profit institutions in the Washington, D.C. area.  6.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  A combined synopsis/solicitation will be issued in FedBizOpps. 7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.   Negotiated costs will be based on available list prices and market research quotes previously obtained.8.  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.   VA has two requirements for Internet2 network access.  First, VA's originating connection will be made from its Reston, Virginia network center location at Sprint.   The second requirement is a connection speed of 1 Gbps.  Because the originating connection is in the Washington, D.C area, the Internet2 connector organization should ideally be in the same geographic region to keep down the cost of installing and maintaining the connection.  MAX is the only Internet2 connector for the Washington, D.C. region.  MAX is also able to meet the second requirement for connection speed.  It is a Gigapop organization and can provide the Department with the required access speed of 1 Gbps.  9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: Please provide:(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. Both Internet2 and Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (MAX) are organizations instituted primarily to support the academic and research communities in the U.S.  Their mission is to provide the infrastructure to help these communities develop the new technologies and applications.  The intent of VA is to use its membership in these organizations to do research and further explore new networking capabilities and applications that can be applied in VA lines of business, including healthcare delivery and education of its workforce.  Formal membership may further support research projects already underway between VA staff and other Internet2 members because of enhanced network connectivity and a general awareness campaign by both VA and Internet2.  10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.    Please provide a list of sources that expressed an interest in the acquisition.University of Maryland Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (MAX)  11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.   The University of Maryland is the only group that can provide these services at this time because what we are requesting to participate in is a lab environment.  Only local, federal government agencies and educational institutions can participate.  No other sources can be solicited for this need.

<DESC>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  A contract may be awarded as a result of this sources sought.  The Department of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration (FTA), on behalf of Federal Transit Administration, Office of Budget & Policy, intends to procure consultant services with an understanding of both FTA's information technology systems and implementation of performance measurement programs.  This requirement will be a competitive set aside for small businesses only.  

The capability package for this sources sought market survey is not expected to be a proposal, but rather statements regarding the company's existing experience in relation to the areas specified in the Statement of Work (SOW).

Background

The quarterly Transit Trends publication is FTA’s current method of presenting its performance measurement products to management and staff.  It is produced in presentation format and contains 14 charts and tables that summarize key performance measures for the agency.  It is posted on the FTA intranet one to two months after the end of each quarter as an Adobe document and an email notifies executive management that the report has been posted.  Although this model has been adequate in the past, it has a number of shortcomings which limit FTA’s ability to implement a more comprehensive performance measurement strategy.

Some of the larger agencies within the Department of Transportation have much more advanced performance measurement display systems.  FTA has reviewed sites and web pages for the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Bureau of Transportation Data.  These sites are backed by automated data management systems that allow them to display larger amounts of data with very little delay, frequent updates, and minimal staff effort.  Private sector sites surveyed are even more sophisticated, utilizing specialized software products and reporting systems that allow truly interactive responses to a range of queries.

FTA has increasingly been emphasizing data-based management and the use of performance measures.  This ongoing effort has resulted in some new measurement approaches and will soon require an improved method of communicating results to management and staff.  This communication is critical to the effectiveness of any performance measurement strategy.  There are a number of different products that facilitate data collection and display, with a variety of different models to follow in implementing such a system.  Therefore, FTA needs to review the various software options and determine which would be best suited for our unique environment.

FTA plans to review data collection practices, consider current and potential performance measures, and identify technical options for implementing a web-based system to meet performance data and measurement needs.  This will result in a set of requirements with a number of options that we will want to explore.  FTA will then bring on a contractor to lead us in evaluating what it will take to implement basic capabilities, in addition to some of the more sophisticated capabilities available in the high-end commercial packages.  This should allow us to make an informed decision on how to build a multi-level performance “dashboard” web site that displays FTA data products in a manner that is simple to maintain and comprehend.  A major objective is to make the data collection process faster and more efficient so that less staff time is required to produce the reports and so the reports come out more often and in a timely manner. 

OBJECTIVE

In essence, the contractor will guide staff through the process of evaluating options and deciding on a solution, including what software packages may need to be purchased.  Therefore, there are two(2) tasks identified as important to effectively complete the work approved by FTA:

Task 1:
Review requirements and technical options identified by FTA.  Provide guidance, logistical support, and supplemental analysis during the process of evaluating the relative merits of different technical options.  This will include drawing up comparisons of the capabilities provided by different options, setting up software demonstrations to guide FTA staff through the evaluation process, and investigating IT compatibility issues.  

Task 2:
Make recommendations to FTA on software products that can best provide functionality to enhance performance measure reporting and on how to implement a performance data reporting system the meets FTA requirements using this software.  

Note: This sources sought is seeking small businesses with the below qualifications:

1.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a 234-bed biomedical research hospital with an active outpatient component.  The Department of Laboratory Medicine processes standard and specialized laboratory tests at the Clinical Center.  The laboratories housed within the Clinical Center process and report approximately one million test results per year.  Because of the unique research role of the NIH, there is also a need for outside clinical laboratory test services to support and augment in-house capabilities.  Off-site laboratory services support ongoing clinical research and clinical trials through the performance of unique or unusual tests.  Because of the research focus, each sample requires a high degree of methodological and reference range uniformity to ensure consistency over time.  Historically, the off-site laboratory services have performed approximately 28,000 tests per year.  

PURPOSE

The purpose of this contract is to establish a mechanism for obtaining laboratory services.  This contract will provide service to the multiple Institutes of the National Institutes of Health through a central site in the Department of Laboratory Medicine of the Clinical Center.  To ensure the continuity and uniformity required for long term clinical studies, and to maximize the efficient use of patient specimens and the Department of Laboratory Medicine’s resources, laboratory services should be provided by a Contractor who has the capability to furnish all laboratory tests listed in Section B in a timely manner.  It is imperative that changes in reference ranges and methodologies be limited during the length of the contract, because the laboratory results will be used in clinical trials.  It is expected that most of the tests will be performed directly by the Contractor, however, some may (must?) be distributed to sub-contractor laboratories, if approved or requested by the Department of Laboratory Medicine COTR.

EVALUATION/AWARD CRITERIA

The Contracting Officer and evaluation panel will select for purposes of award the best overall proposal based primarily upon technical merit with cost and other factors considered as appropriate.  In determining the best overall proposal, the following minimum qualifications will be considered:

1.	TECHNICAL PROPOSAL – An objective technical evaluation will be performed on each offeror’s technical proposal based solely on the information furnished and not on previous knowledge or associations.  

a.  An objective price analysis will be performed on each offeror’s price proposal including all options.  Any proposed prompt payment discounts or credits will also be evaluated.  For details on how each offerors price will be evaluated see the price evaluation section.			

b.  The Offeror receiving this award must be accredited by the College of American Pathologists or show evidence of certification with equivalent standards and be eligible to obtain Federal contracts.  The quality of testing will be evaluated based on the qualifications of the technical and directorial staff and the diversity of the test menu.  The quality of testing will also be judged on whether state-of-the art test methodologies and instrumentation exists, the capability of interfacing with SOFT (SCC) Laboratory Information System, (ordering and reporting) and the capability to provide extensive data on test performance upon request.								

c.  The Offeror shall provide the best turn-around-times available based on industry  standards and methodologies and have to meet the clinical needs of DLM.  Reporting of these results must be electronically transmitted by Contractor’s Laboratory Information System (LIS) to the DLM SOFT LIS.  This interface must be built and tested prior to final acceptance by the Government.  The Contractor will be responsible for any cost related to the initial building or maintenance of the interface.    Consideration will also be given to the % of testing that will be performed at on-site facility and the % of testing that will be sent off-site.
									

d.  The Offeror shall provide client services that will include customer services via telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, support for specimen handling and a dependable courier service with option of weekend pickup at no additional cost with delivery to the testing lab by at least 5:00am local time the following calendar day.						

e.  The offeror shall provide support for test interpretations through the use of consultations with doctoral experts, interpretive guides, extensive data on reference ranges and test performance and parallel testing of specimens when there are methodology changes.					

f.  The offeror shall provide support to the Department of Laboratory Medicine operations by giving assistance with method validation and evaluation, new test development, and offer continuing education programs.  Within one (1) year after the contractor has developed a new test, the contractor when requested shall assist the NIH Clinical Center laboratory in the development of this new test for use in the NIH Clinical Center laboratory.  		

g.  The offeror shall submit documentation of the experience with testing for clinical research and use of advanced test methodologies that provide optional data for research protocols, including any evidence of the ability to generate a database for human patient lab testing.	

h.  Past Performance/Prior Experience				

Past Performance
	
Past performance will be evaluated from a business and technical standpoint to determine the relative merits of the proposal.  The performance of the contractor on earlier work for the Government or the private sector will be a very significant indicator of how well the contractor can be expected to perform the required services in the future.  The information presented by the contractor together with that available from sources within the Government will provide the information for this portion of the technical evaluation.  References from labs with a similar lab set-up are requested at time of submission.

The Offeror’s past performance will be evaluated after determination of the competitive range of the proposals.  Only those offerors included in the competitive range will be evaluated. 

The Government will evaluate the quality of the Offeror’s past performance based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.

The assessment of the Offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and the other competitors.  Thus, an offeror with the exceptional record of past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable even though both may have acceptable technical proposals.

Past performance will be scored, and the Government’s conclusions about overall quality of the Offeror’s past performance will be highly influential in determining the relative merits of the offer’s proposal and in selecting the offeror, whose proposal is considered most advantageous to the Government.

By past performance, the Government means the offeror’s record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror’s record of forecasting and controlling costs; the offeror’s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror’s reputations for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

The Government will consider the number and severity of an offeror’s problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the offeror’s overall work record, and the age and relevance or past performance information.

The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.

2.	GENERAL RELATIONSHIP – TECHNICAL MERIT VERSUS COST

In the relationship of technical merit versus cost, offerors are advised that overall cost of contract performance will not be considered as controlling.  However, in the event evaluations result in substantially equal technical proposals, overall cost will be a major factor in selection of a proposal for award.   In the event evaluations result in acceptable technical proposals with a significant difference in technical weighting, overall cost will be considered but will not be major in making a determination as to which proposal offers the greatest value and is most advantageous to the Government.
	
      The vendor‘s response shall also include any other specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company to perform the specialized requirements described in the synopsis. Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted, to this market survey extensive with and the ability to perform all of the specialized requirements elsewhere described.

This notice is a market survey and is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The Government will not award a Purchase Order or contract based upon Vendor responses to this announcement. The Government shall not assume any costs for preparing or submitting any information in response to the survey of the Government’s use of the information.

<CONTACT>Joanna M. Magginas, Chief, Procurement  Branch, Phone (301) 435-0360, Email Magginaj@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) , Translational Medical Branch (TMB) is seeking to purchase a Biplane X-ray Angio System for cardiovascular intervention, investigational X-ray/MRI fusion, and support of interventional MRI system. 

The TMB has taken a leading role in developing advanced cardiac imaging methods and minimally invasive interventional procedures.  This work has included some of the first XFM-guided (X-ray Fused with MRI) and wholly real-time MRI guided vascular interventional procedures in humans, as well as preclinical development of a novel treatment for ischemic mitral valve regurgitation.  TMB is staffed by a large team of physiologists, engineers, physicists, and physicians spanning a wide range of interests ranging from sub cellular metabolism to human diagnostic imaging and catheter-based interventions.
TMB requires a new X-ray fluoroscopy system to introduce new capability for image-guided intervention.  Flat-panel X-ray detectors are necessary for further development and application of intramural XFM (X-ray Fused with MRI) technology.  The Biplane X-ray Angio system is necessary for treatment of structural heart disease, congenital heart disease, and for sparing iodinated radiocontrast in patients.  This new technology would be combined with the current X-ray and MRI interventional suite.

<DESC>The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to provide a continuum of planning, organizational, logistical, and facilitation services for the Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor & Human Trafficking (OCFT)-sponsored grantee meetings and other occasional meetings, conferences, and symposia; and Record proceedings of the aforementioned OCFT-sponsored events and prepare related reports as requested. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.

Background

The Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking (OCFT) is an office within the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB), an agency of the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL).  OCFT activities include research on international child labor; supporting U.S. government policy on international child labor; administering and overseeing cooperative agreements with organizations working to eliminate child labor around the world; and raising awareness about child labor issues.  
Since 1995, the U.S. Congress has appropriated over $720 million to USDOL for efforts to combat exploitive child labor internationally.  This funding has been used to support technical cooperation projects to combat exploitive child labor in more than 80 countries around the world. Technical cooperation projects funded by USDOL range from targeted action programs in specific sectors of work to more comprehensive programs that support national efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor as defined by ILO Convention 182. USDOL-funded child labor elimination projects generally seek to achieve five major goals:
1.	Withdrawing or preventing children from involvement in exploitive child labor through the provision of direct educational services;
2.	Strengthening policies on child labor and education, the capacity of national institutions to combat child labor, and formal and transitional education systems that encourage children engaged in or at risk of engaging in exploitive labor to attend school;
3.	Raising awareness of the importance of education for all children and mobilizing a wide array of actors to improve and expand education infrastructures;

<DESC>The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a package of related services including research, analysis of business practices, a publication, and meetings/trainings.  Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.

Background

The Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking (OCFT) of the Department of Labor’s Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) is interested in awarding a contract for a package of related services including developing a framework/set of criteria; conducting background research and producing a bibliography; producing a compendium; carrying out stakeholder consultations/meetings; and providnig training to USDOL staff.  These services will assist OCFT in fulfilling an important mandate under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 (TVPRA).  The TVPRA directed ILAB to, among other things, “work with persons involved in the production of goods [using forced labor or child labor] to create a standard set of practices that will reduce the likelihood that such persons will produce goods using [such] labor.”

OCFT was created in 1993 in response to a request from Congress to investigate and report on child labor around the world. As domestic and international concern about child labor grew, OCFT’s activities significantly expanded.  Today, these activities include research on international child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking; funding and overseeing cooperative agreements and contracts to organizations engaged in efforts to eliminate exploitive child labor around the world; and assisting in the development and implementation of U.S. government policy on international child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking issues.

OCFT plays an active role in research and policy initiatives relating to international child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking. Pursuant to Congressional requests, OCFT has published annual international child labor reports since 1994.  In 2000, Congress adopted the Trade and Development Act, which requires the Secretary of Labor to issue an annual report on the efforts of approximately 140 U.S. trade beneficiary countries and territories to meet their international commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.  Through these research activities as well as technical cooperation programming, ILAB OCFT promotes international labor standards and aims to comply with the U.S. Government commitments under International Labor Organization Convention No. 182 to work with other countries to assist in efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor.

Purpose and Objectives

The goal of the proposed program is to reduce the likelihood that producers of goods worldwide will use forced labor and child labor in their production.  The TVPRA proposed to achieve this goal by working with persons involved in production to explore good practices in this area.  To accomplish this goal, USDOL has established several key objectives, including the development of a framework/set of criteria to evaluate good practice; wide dissemination of examples of good practices for replication; stakeholder engagement through meetings and consultations; and increased capacity of USDOL staff to provide technical assistance to companies on these and related issues.

Project Requirements

Task 1:  Framework/Set of Criteria.  Develop a framework/set of criteria for analyzing and identifying “good practices” that can be used by private sector entities to reduce the likelihood that goods are produced using child labor and forced labor.  Development of this framework/set of criteria should include not only the framework itself, but guidelines for its application.  These guidelines should clearly describe how the framework is to be used, by whom, for what purpose(s), etc.  

Task 2:  Background Research/Bibliography.  Conduct comprehensive background research and produce a bibliography of current practices in use (such as tools, toolkits, systems, activities, programs, relationships, collaborative arrangements, etc.) to reduce child labor and forced labor in the production of goods.  Research should include such methods as desk review, attending meetings of knowledgeable groups, interviews with companies, and other methods.  

Task 3:  Compendium.  Using the framework/set of criteria developed under Task 1 and the practices collected under Task 2, identify a selection of the best practices currently in use and compile them into a Compendium targeting a business audience.  The Compendium should include examples of practices in a wide variety of categories, and could be written as case studies or in other formats.  It must be a complete, print-ready publication, in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, including all relevant content: all text, sidebars/highlight boxes, suggested graphics/photos, etc.  The publication will be posted on USDOL’s Web site and must be Section 508 compliant.  

Task 4:  Meetings/Consultations.  At least two stakeholder meetings/consultations with businesses, employers’ organizations, NGOs, and trade unions, at a minimum.  At least one consultation should occur within the United States.  Each meeting/consultation should be followed by a summary of meeting proceedings that can be published and disseminated to keep all stakeholders informed.  

Task 5:  Training for USDOL Staff.  A training or series of trainings to build the capacity of USDOL/OCFT staff.  Staff should be trained in the content of research conducted, in the analysis of good business practices, and in skills to provide technical assistance to businesses seeking guidance from USDOL in the area of forced labor and child labor eradication.  

Capability Statement

OCFT is interested in soliciting capability statements from all qualified Offerors demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort. At a minimum prospective Offerors must document capabilities in the following areas.

•	Familiarity with current business practices in the area of child and forced labor in global supply chains, in a variety of industries.  Familiarity may be demonstrated through a discussion of how the organization used it in prior work, or through convincing discussion of the work of others.
•	Capacity to innovate systematic analytical tools (i.e., Task 1, the framework/set of criteria).
•	Capacity to research and analyze “good practices” for businesses/private sector in combating forced labor and child labor in a comprehensive manner.
•	Familiarity with other current efforts to formulate, compile, analyze, and disseminate guidance and good practice in this area (in order to avoid duplication).
•	Experience producing publication-quality written materials.
•	Track record of working with business/private sector entities to formulate policies and guide implementation of practices in this area. 
•	Track record of successful multi-stakeholder engagement on related topics.
•	Capacity and skills to guide high-profile meetings and consultations with various stakeholders, including business.
•	Capacity and skills to conduct training.
•	Personnel possess knowledge of current business practices in the area of child and forced labor in global supply chains, in a variety of industries. 
•	Personnel possess experience in creating analytical tools.
•	Personnel possess experience working on publications in related fields.
•	Personnel possess experience working with a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the field of corporate social responsibility.
•	Personnel possess experience in guiding high-profile meetings and consultations with various stakeholders, including business.

<DESC>This notice serves as public announcement that United States Postal Service (USPS) is seeking to pre-qualify sources for participation in future competitive acquisitions for selection of contractors to provide and complete audit services for a third party logistics provider for the Non-Mail Freight Team. The Non-Mail Freight Team utilizes two third party logistics providers to maintain a logistics network for the transportation of freight throughout the United States Postal Service’s network.  Historically, the third party logistics providers complete between 25,000 and 60,000 transactions per year for the Non-Mail Freight Team.  The purpose of the audit is to serve as an independent check of the transactions provided by the third party logistics providers.  The United States Postal Service would like a supplier with specific skills in developing and implementing written procedures for the independent review of invoices to confirm the shipping and receipt of good and services and to ensure accurate payment.  Suppliers that have experience in this type of work can submit documentation showing specific experience of this kind as well as a proposal of the work to be completed for the United States Postal Service.  Along with this documentation, the United States Postal Service will be completing the prequalification process to identify suppliers capable of completing the proposed service. 


Prequalification is the process of up-front identification of top-quality suppliers able to compete for specific types of contract opportunities. Selection of the appropriate suppliers is critical to the Postal Service's success. This augments the Postal Service's ability to deliver high-quality and innovative services to its customers and reduces operational risks. Pre-qualifying suppliers enhances competition, ensures quality performance, and can also shorten cycle time and strengthen relationships between the Postal Service and its suppliers.

For the purpose of this potential solicitation, the prequalification will include the following.  
•	The supplier must be a registered corporation in the United States of America.
•	The supplier must have at least three years of freight auditing experience. 
•	The supplier must provide an income statement and balance sheet for at least one year of service.
•	The supplier is to provide the number of employees and office locations within the United States.  
 

The USPS intends to pre-qualify an adequate number of suppliers whose record of performance in the marketplace (commercial or governmental or both) have demonstrated their ability to consistently perform to high standards of quality and reliability.

SOURCES SOUGHT FOR RADAR PROCESSING SERVICES FOR USCG DEVELOPED VEGA ECINS PROJECT PR #21-09-449TED766


OVERVIEW:
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (THIS IS NOT A RFP OR RFQ) to identify firms capable of providing all labor, material, equipment, transportation and supervision & program/project management required for the USCG C2CEN in Portsmouth VA to have a Contractor to provide the Services as stated herein. 


The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking sources to replace Radar Processing Services (RPS), hardware and software, currently fielded aboard Coast Guard Juniper, Keeper, and Coastal Marine Protector Class Cutters.  The goal of the effort is to replace several fielded commercial RPS units with one common unit.  Prospective units shall provide all RPS for the Coast Guard owned and developed ECINS (Electronic Charting Integrated Navigation System) product call Vega ECINS, which is in development under a separate project.

Included below is a preliminary list of requirements to allow RPS manufactures the ability to review the scope of the project and provide feedback on prospective products along with a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) of unit costs.  All interested companies are encouraged to respond, regardless of the number of requirements they feel they currently fulfill.  Future refinement of these requirements may take place based on information the USCG receives along with current technology limitations and/or overall costs.

PRELIMINARY REQUIREMENTS:

The RPS shall:

1.)	Consist of hardware and/or software. 

2.)	Contain Microsoft XP OS or newer.

3.)	Be external to the USCG Vega PC based ECINS on a small form factor, 1U or less of rack space.

3.) Integrate with multiple radar vendors’, such as Sperry’s BridgeMaster E Marine Radar and Raytheon’s AN-SPS-73 Marine Radar, using standard analog radar signals. 
		
4.) Provide a radar transparent overlay image suitable for integration onto Vega ECINS charting video.

5.)  Provide a distributed radar solution.  Communications with Vega ECINS shall use Microsoft’s Service-Oriented Architecture .Net framework, via an Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN).

6.)	Ability to provide level one radar control of Sperry’s BridgeMaster E Marine Radar and Raytheon’s AN-SPS-73 Marine Radar.

7.)	 The RPS will not replace the radar unit’s indicator or radar processor units.  In addition, the RPS will not require a tracking module, recording module, or a requirement to integrate multiple radar units into one overlay.

  Vendors interested in performing this requirement are invited to provide the following information to USCG C2CEN no later than July/27/2009 @ 8:00AM EST.     NO TELEPHONE CALLS ARE ACCEPTED.

The tasks are intelligence missions and the scenarios are representations of "red" activity and "blue" operational capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Decision makers will use the output of this Construct to make force management and investment decisions for ISR capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Integration of non-developmental systems is expected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">The objective of the ISR Force Sizing Construct is to develop a capability that can evaluate existing and planned resources and determine optimal ISR mixes to cover anticipated ISR requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It shall include a tool or system to rapidly recommend optimal ISR capabilities needed to address a series of tasks or requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Optimal solutions are those mixes that meet defined sufficiency criteria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Central to this segment is the identification and explanation of metrics/measures associated with the assignment of forces against requirements utilizing existing processes; and the establishment of sufficiency criteria (i.e. what is a sufficient amount of intelligence, generated by the ISR mix, to address the tasks).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tool should be flexible enough to incorporate existing and proposed forces, requirements, and processes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be capable of considering wide-ranging scenarios that are potentially geographically dispersed, contain multiple intelligence tasks (i.e. Warning, science and technology, support to military operations, etc) or both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source basis with Thomson Reuters (Scientific), Inc. 3501 Market Street Philadelphia, PA. The University Science Indicators (USI) and the Institutional Citation Reports (ICR) are used to analyze and extract data on the impact of NIST publications to demonstrate the utility and relevance of NIST technical publications, and to show state collaborations. This requirement also includes the new Conference proceedings Citation Index (CPCI), which will provide NIST with a broader set of research papers to extract impact data, especially for those in the engineering area. The USI is essential for reporting the year end data associated with one of NIST’s performance measures under the Government performance and Reporting Act, “Citation impact of NIST-authored publications.” This information is reported in several external documents in response to this Act, including the Annual Performance and Accountability Report and the Annual Performance Plans submitted with the Budget Request which is sent to DoC, OMB, and Congress.  The ICR includes the detailed information used to generate the USI and is essential for producing more comprehensive analyses on the impact of NIST technical publications.  For example, the names and addresses of specific organizations associated with authors that cite or co-author NIST papers help to demonstrate the nation-wide impact of NIST illustrated on U.S. maps used in presentations on NIST impact. This data will be expanded to include the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI), information.  
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) because the Government has not identified any other sources that can meet the requirements specified above. Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that clearly and unambiguously demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to provide these services. Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>DESCRIPTION:<br />The project will be awarded through an action under one of the multiple award task order contracts (MATOCs). This announcement is to facilitate the maximum competition among Subcontractors and Suppliers.
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to award a construction contract for the National Ocean Service (NOS) Gulf of Mexico Disaster Response Center (GoMDRC) located in Mobile, Alabama. NOAA must ensure that it can continue to efficiently and effectively meet its mission requirements to reduce the environmental, economic, and human risk consequences resulting from natural or human-induced emergencies along the nation's coasts. The construction of this project is needed to satisfy those demands. The Gulf of Mexico is particularly vulnerable to disasters due to a combination of factors. These include not only frequent hurricanes and other severe weather events but also the pollution potential of its oil industry; its fragile ecosystem; the number of economically critical ports, waterways and fishing industries in the Gulf region.</p>
<p>To provide for this capability, NOAA will establish a physical center in the Mobile, Alabama, vicinity to house staff and programming that will deliver data, observations, forecasts and scientific expertise before, during, and after emergency events in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>This procurement is a Firm-Fixed Price Contract for Construction. The estimated construction cost is $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.</p>
<p>Interested Subcontractors and Suppliers are directed to contact the MATOC holders for more information. The Request for Proposal will be posted on FedBizOps on/or about July 10, 2009.</p>

<SUBJECT>Otolith growth analysis to elucidate environmental influences on growth of rockfish early life history 
<SOLNBR>WRAD-9-15676
<RESPDATE>070909
<CONTACT>Melvin N. Fondue, Phone (206) 526-6043, Email melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) with Humboldt State University to provide techincal support for Groundfish stock assessments on the US West Coast typically employ information on age and/or length composition derived from port samples and abundance estimates derived from trawl surveys. More recently, assessments for some stocks have incorporated as data fishery-independent estimates of pre-recruit abundance obtained from a coast-wide midwater trawl survey of pelagic juvenile rockfish (Sakuma et al. 2006, Hastie and Ralston 2007). Environmental indices have not yet been incorporated in these assessments.</p>
<p>NOAA's Fisheries and the Environment (FATE) program recently funded a proposal to develop recruitment indices for rockfish through the use of individual based models (IBM) for rockfish early life history stages (ELHS) nested in a coupled bio-physical model (CBPM) of the coastal upwelling system off north-central California and elsewhere along the U.S. West Coast. One element of this work is to develop and analyze otolith growth data to improve IBMs for rockfish ELHS, with specific focus on enriching our empirical understanding of how growth rates of rockfish ELHS respond to environmental forcing.</p>
<p>The requested funds will support a graduate (Masters) student enrolled in the Department of Fisheries Biology at Humboldt State University to carry out the work described in the Project Summary. This work will be conducted under the supervision of Dr. Eric Bjorkstedt, and will take advantage of existing microscopy assets at HSU.</p>
<p>Project Summary</p>
<p>(1) Extract growth chronologies from archived otoliths of pelagic juvenile chilipepper (Sebastes goodei), yellowtail rockfish (S. flavidus), and widow rockfish (S. entomelas) collected during the 1990s and 2000s, and compile these data with similar observations from the 1985-1989 year classes.<br />(2) Analyze these new data and existing data from the 1985-1989 year classes to model otolith growth in response to a suite of environmental parameters, including, e.g., Ekman transport, turbulence, sea level anomaly, sea surface temperature, and outputs from coupled bio-physical models for the coastal marine ecosystem.<br /><br />Deliverables</p>
<p>(1) Database of otolith growth increments and associated microphotographic records of otoliths.<br />(2) M.S. Thesis on response of otolith growth rates to environmental forcing.<br />&nbsp;Interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to 206-526-6025 or email (melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov) . This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.</p>

<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Northwest Regional Office on a sole source basis with Skagit River System Cooperative. The government intends to acquire the services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor shall document the stray rate of Chinook salmon returning to the Marblemount hatchery on the Skagit River for improvement of escapement estimates to the Pacific Salmon Commission's Chinook Technical Committee (CTC) standards and improve the data used in analytical methods that support Chinook salmon Abundance-Based management under the Pacific Salmon (Treaty).<br />The services required for this contract are:<br />&bull; Tag sample at least 10% of the Chinook spawners in the vicinity of the Marblemount Hatchery during the spawning timing of spring Chinook<br />&bull; Estimate the number of hatchery stray spawners by age and release stage, and estimate the total number of strays to within a Coefficient of Variation (C.V.) &plusmn; 15%<br />&bull; Calculate the hatchery stray rate, and compare it to the rate estimated in previous years<br />&bull; Develop several options, with design and cost estimates, for improving fish passage into Marblemount Hatchery<br />The United States Chinook Technical Committee (USCTC) of the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) on behalf of the Pacific Salmon (Treaty) has previously identified data standards for stock assessment and has made recommendations for improving data quality and assessments. The USCTC has requested that a program be conducted to determine the Skagit Hatchery spring Chinook stray rate. The work to be accomplished by the contractor needs to technically and administratively meet the following two research themes as identified in the USCTC request for proposals memorandum dated December 11, 2008: Research Theme #2 (Improvement of Escapement Estimates to USCTC Standards), and Research Theme #4 (Improvement of Analytical Methods for Abundance-based Management). These project shall be addressing these themes, will support improved Abundance-Based management by removing bias from ER estimates, as well as from estimates of hatchery survival rate and abundance of both the hatchery stock and the associated Skagit natural spring stock. This information is required for this stock to be used as a PSC Chinook indicator stock. The Skagit River System Cooperative conducted a pilot study in 2006 that found that the undocumented straying rate was a significant problem and this experience will allow them to design an effective project for the 2009/2010 season. The Skagit River Chinook stocks are a population within Puget sound Chinook ESU that are listed as threatened under Endangered Species Act and the Skagit River System Cooperative holds the required permit to conduct research on them. The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract with period of performance of twelve months from date of award. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed attention to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513or email at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov.

Prices are determined to be substantially below median costs and are considered by the Contracting Officer to be Fair and Reasonable. 8.  Market Survey (FAR 10): Based on market research this SDVOSB is trained and capable of performing the duties of Financial Resources Consultant as well as significant other consulting duties,  there is no requirement for training and the resulting experience will provide the best value to the government. 9.  Other Considerations:  Not applicable.10.  Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: No sources have expressed in writing an interest in this acquisition.11.  Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: No actions intended as the action is based on statutory authority for sole source.  12.

<DESC>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the 'Act'), Public Law 111-5, this notice is provided for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), intends to modify Contract No. 06CRCN0006 with Honeywell Tech Solutions, to include Act related provisions, which are incorporated into the contract via Modification 21.  The requirement described below is within scope of the existing contract, which was originally awarded on a competitive basis.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE INCUMBENT CONTRACTOR.
The USGS (U.S. Geological Survey) operates seismic stations in every continent and in over 60 countries around the world in order to provide rapid earthquake information for emergency response.  The USGS Global Seismic Network (GSN) consists of approximately 100 stations. The proposed ARRA work will fund additional personnel and field work to modernize approximately 23 GSN stations.  The method used for this acquisition was full and open competition.  The modification is not fixed price because many external factors, such as unknown site conditions, political upheaval and civil unrest, indeterminate equipment shipping schedules, delays in customs clearance, foreign travel costs, and unpredictable equipment failures, impose unacceptable risk for a bidder on a fixed price contract. The total estimated contract cost for the base year and four option years is $14.2 million.  The proposed ARRA work is less than 10% of the contract total.  This contract is currently in Option Year Three with a period of performance of 10/01/2008 through 09/30/2009, and contains one more option period, 10/01/2009 through 09/30/2010. The place of performance is Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Full or partial funding for requirements to be completed by the contractor will utilize funds provided by the Act.  Inclusion of unique provisions required to implement the Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency requirements by Honeywell Tech. Solutions, will be incorporated into this contract by Modification 21. (ATN# ARRA-SE0002B)

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Raytheon Company, Andover, Massachusetts for Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) support of the Army Integrated Air Missile Defense (AIAMD) mission.  The first phase of the effort will generate  interface documentation and identify the necessary information to develop a budgetary input for the cost of designing and developing an A-Kit for the JLENS side of the IAMD interface.  Phase two will continue the A-Kit design effort and commonality with the IAMD B-Kit.  The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  Award to any source other than Raytheon Company would result in unacceptable delays and substantial costs.  The significant duplication of cost involved with a new contractor is considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed toward Raytheon Company.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to Dianne Trimble at dianne.trimble@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit a response which will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.

<p>Description of Requirements<br />ATSDR's Geospatial Research, Analysis, &amp; Services Program (GRASP) is on the forefront of the use of spatial analysis tools for public health applications. Other activities include demographic analyses, medical geography, exposure assessment and contaminant modeling. Scientists in the program use US Census data, health outcome data, and contaminant data collected by State and Federal agencies and their contractors to address public health related issues related to potential exposure to hazardous substances in the environment. In addition, field personnel collect spatial data at sites using global positioning system (GPS) technology for integration within the GIS.</p>
<p>GRASP provides GIS support to the CDC DEOC and is responsible for staffing field teams and assisting in the operation of field investigations. The rapid response team assists program areas in the analysis of factors related to current disease outbreaks, emergency exposures, and other natural and man-made events, provides technical assistance in the collection of information in a spatial context, and establishes protocols for GIS products and services in the field and in the operations centers. This unit functions as the primary point of contact with NCEH/ATSDR in the areas of terrorism preparedness and emergency response.</p>
<p>Since the fall of 2001, the GRASP has been providing GIS support to emergency operations at CDC. When the new DEOC was completed in March of 2003, GRASP GIS has been involved full-time in the events that the DEOC responds to such as the Monkeypox outbreak, West Nile Virus, Hurricanes in Florida, and a number of exercises. GIS is a fully integrated part of the DEOC and may even be thought of as an annex of the main body of the GIS program. The program interfaces with many CIOs to provide the geographic products used in executive level public health management decisions. It is involved with building applications such as the personnel deployment mapping application, which tracks the geographic placement of CDC staff world-wide which helps manage assets in a public health emergency.</p>
<p>An integral part of the GRASP is the conceptualization, architecture, and direction of web/desktop-based GIS applications and of web services that make geospatial tools available to program and agency information systems. Additionally, the program maintains the enterprise-grade geospatial data warehouse that serves to create, manage, and store government, commercial and GPS field-derived geospatial data that is used throughout the program and agency in analysis, research, emergency response, and systems integration efforts.</p>
<p>Examples of unit-supported GIS applications include web-based interactive atlases, web-based geospatial gazetteers, web services that contain components for spatial analysis and/or reporting, and desktop productivity tools for cartographic production and geospatial analysis. The geospatial data warehouse, which contains base map, socio-demographic, emergency response, environmental, hazard, and health resource data, is used by a wide array of individuals and all of the web-based applications.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>The objective of the proposed award is to acquire a license for comprehensive domestic GIS data to GRASP for use within GRASP cartographic products, applications, and analytic services.. The offeror shall be required to ensure that the street reference files used within the CDC ATSDR GRASP Centrus geocoding software is completely compatible and entirely locationally-consistent with the proposed product. The street reference files used within the CDC ATSDR GRASP Centrus geocoding software is currently provided by TeleAtlas, Inc. Thus, the offeror must ensure that its GIS data product is entirely locationally consistent with the TeleAtlas, Inc. street reference files OR the offeror must propose a solution in which consistency between the offeror's GIS data product and the street reference files employed within the Centrus geocoding software is guaranteed. The contract stipulates one base period (1 year) with 2 option periods (1 year each).</p>

These data layers are required for GRASP to perform complete and accurates analyses of public health issues such as disease dispersion, environmental health, built environment, health care accessibility, and emergency preparedness &amp; response. Significant level of detail is required to enhance GRASP's ability to develop final products such as maps, analytic reports, and indices on a variety of public health topics. The offeror shall be required to ensure that the street reference files used within the CDC ATSDR GRASP Centrus geocoding software is completely compatible and entirely locationally-consistent with the proposed product.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2009-208-TMB and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33 (6/15/2009).

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This solicitation is set aside for small business. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to procure the services from Sequenom, Inc., 3595 John Hopkins Court, San Diego, CA 92121-1121 for the following:

1.	Catalog Number: 10920-1, MassARRAY Compact System with Server and RT workstation, includes: MassARRAY Analyzer Compact MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer for separation, detection and characterization of the analyte molecules from SpectroCHIP arrays, MassARRAY RT Workstation for real-time data analysis, MassARRAY Server for data management and Compact Laser MNL 103-PD.

2.	Catalog Number: 10118, MassARRAY Clean Resin Tool Kit (no charge)

The sole source determination is based on the fact the data acquisition and system control for all MassARRAY platforms is via proprietary software developed by Sequenom. The computer workstation dedicated to these tasks was developed with software modules such that all data obtained through the MALDI-TOF is controlled through this workstation software and not through vendor software for the genetic analysis applications. Once data is obtained from each sample the electronic signal is processed and analyzed using each individual software application. (i.e. genotyping, quantitative gene expression, methylation analysis, etc.) Ultimately this method of data processing and acquisition is unique for Sequenom and other vendors only supply small portions of this solution. However, the solutions provided by other vendors are often slower and less specific then that delivered by Sequenom requiring greater user intervention and technique (manual sample analysis) resulting in more time and inconsistencies. The MassARRAY therefore provides a fully integrated turn-key system platform for a range of genetic analysis applications.

The specific Sequenom MassARRAY Compact System is required to complement the high throughput genotyping system currently used in the laboratory. These scanners are custom designed for this genotyping process. This process has been utilized for eleven years. There are no other manufacturers that make a compatible scanner for this high throughput system. The MassARRAY system is fully compatible with the current instruments and the database which archives and tracks the genotyping process. No other manufacturer can supply an instrument that meets these requirements.

 
The offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; 2) As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Evaluation and Price. 3) FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; 4) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; and 5) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions. This action is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however; all responses received within five (5) days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for supplies in which the government intends to acquire in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) located in Seattle, WA intends to acquire the following items: A.) 48" OR 49" DIAMETER ACOUSTIC DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILER (ADCP) BUOY RATED 1000M, 1100 LBS GROSS BUOYANCY, B.) INTEGRAL HANDLING FRAME (22" BOLT CIRCLE) MADE FROM 316 STAINLESS STEEL . See attached detailed specifications and drawings. <br />BACKGROUND:<br />The ADCP buoy and integral handling frame is the primary component of the TAO Project's subsurface upper ocean current data collection mooring. The ADCP buoy is a spherical float that provides underwater flotation and has a special instrument well to mount the RDIffeledyne Workhorse Long Ranger ADCP. The integral frame is inserted through holes in the sphere and acts as the strength member and skeleton to support the flotation, as well as an attachment point to tether it to the bottom. The frame also provides mounting pads for attaching additional instrumentation for measuring salinity, temperature, and depth. The 5 new ADCP buoys &amp; frames are needed for new deployment sites in the build-up of the Indian Ocean "RAMA" Observational Array. The current data from these moorings will be used to measure ocean climate processes with an emphasis on the Indian Ocean seasonal monsoonal cycle and the Madden Julian Oscillation, which can be a precursor for EI Nino in the Tropical Pacific. There will be a total of 12 ADCP mooring sites that will be maintained by the TAO Project in the Indian Ocean. These 5 buoys are scheduled for deployment in early 2010 and will be shipped to India in November of 2009.

<RESPDATE>071009
<CONTACT>Maria L Mendoza, Phone (206)526-6671, Email Maria.L.Mendoza@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for services in which the government intends to acquire in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA has a requirement for a contractor to provide following services: 1. Collection of a single post canine tooth from up to 300 live-captured northern fur seal females during tagging operations scheduled for fall 2009 on St. Paul and St. George Islands. Completed by Oct. 30, 2009. 2. Instruction of NMML personnel on the proper methods to be used in tooth extraction from live fur seals. Completed by Oct. 30, 2009.<br />3. The preparation, acid etching, and aging of 500 canine teeth collected from fur seal carcasses found on the Pribilof Islands. Completed by August 1, 2010. 4. The preparation of a final report that summarizes the method of tooth aging used with the canines and the results. Completed by August 30, 2010.<br />This project will support two separate research projects that build on the work conducted in 2008.<br />1. The collection of teeth from live fur seals. During the summer-fall of 2008 NMML conducted a prototype study that involved tagging and tooth sampling from live adult female northern fur seals. This method has proven to be an effective tool for aging live animals. However, the skills to conduct this work quickly and efficiently are not available within the Alaska Ecosystems Program. Work conducted in 2009 indicated that it will take a few years before the ability to collect teeth at a rate deemed efficient will be available. To date, tooth samples have only been collected from fur seals that have been culled or died of natural causes. This contract seeks an experienced individual to assist in this work as well as to train NMML scientists. This individual will be required to travel to St. Paul Island, Alaska in September of 2009 for approximately 20 days of work to collect teeth and train NMML staff. <br />2. The aging of previously collected teeth from carcasses. The NMML has been routinely collecting canine teeth from fur seals found dead on the rookeries during surveys since 1974. During this time over 3,000 teeth have been collected. Canines are large, difficult teeth to section and read. A random sample of 500 upper canine teeth will be removed and sectioned longitudinally through the center of the pulp cavity using a diamond saw. Polished tooth sections will be etched with formic acid for 22-26 h depending on tooth size. Sections will then be thoroughly rinsed in water, air dried, and rubbed with graphite powder. Light will then be projected across the etched surface, and light and dark lines will be counted at 10X magnification. Each pair of lines (a ridge and hollow; one growth layer group or GLG) is equivalent to one year's growth, which has been validated on known-age individuals, in several fur seal species. To estimate the precision of the aging technique, the number of GLG will be counted at repeated reading sessions. During each session, each tooth will be given a subjective score of readability (1-4 = excellent to unreadable) and detailed notes will be made on any damage to the tooth. Three to five reading sessions will be undertaken for each tooth without prior knowledge of the previous estimation nor animal identification. If the three readings are the same, that value will be assigned as the animal's age estimate. If two readings are the same and the third reading differs by no more than one year the modal value will be taken as the final age. In the case that a third reading differs by more than one year from the mode or all three readings differ, two more readings will be made and the mean and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. Individual readings beyond the 95% confidence interval (&lsquo;outliers') will be removed and the final age estimate will be calculated as the median of the remaining values. Age estimations will be corrected for date of collection by adjusting ages to the nearest 0.1 yr, based on the mean date of birth at the St Paul Is colony. All readings will be conducted by a single reader, in order to eliminate inter-reader biases.
<p>Contractors responding to this solicitation must have experience in both the needs of this contract: 1. The collection of post-canine teeth from live fur seals in the wild, the ability and willingness to travel to St. Paul Island, Alaska in the fall of 2009, and<br />2. Experience preparing and aging canine teeth from fur seals and access to a laboratory with the appropriate tools to conduct the work.</p>
<p>All interested concerns must submit a quotation and documentation demonstrating the qualifications to provide services as described above within fifteen (15) days of the publication date of this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Only firms that can provide the services described herein will be considered. A fixed firm order will be issued with period of performance of one year plus two option years. It is anticipated that work on this project will start Sept 1, 2009. This RFQ closes at 4:00 p.m. July 10, 2009.

The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
Request for Quotations (RFQ) will be evaluated against the requirements listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, and the ALC drawings.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government in technical factors, and price considered.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance.  When combined, non-price factors are more important than price. 

1)	Technical Conformance to Specifications
2)	Past Performance
3)	Warranty
4)	Price

Technical Conformance 

The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the drawings. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer. An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQ’s technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. 

Past Performance

Offers shall provide at least two (2) references for recent and relevant contracts for the manufacturing of safety belts.  Reference information must include contract numbers, points of contract names with telephone numbers and other relevant information.  For this factor the Government will evaluate information obtained from past performance information that the Government obtains about the offeror from these contacts or other sources.  Failure to address this requirement can result in failure of this evaluation factor.

Warranty
 
Offerors are required to offer the Government at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice.

Price

Proposals should identify any price reductions offered, or quantity discounts.

(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(2) &#61551; Outside the United States. 
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror &#61551; does &#61551; does not certify that—

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
                                                Commandant (G-A)

U.S. COAST GUARD
HU25 ATF3-6 ENGINE NOSE-COWLING (PN 553-0170 SERIES) REPAIR
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel (Falcon Jet Corporation).  Each aircraft is equipped with two Honeywell ATF3-6 fan jet engines.  Typical failure modes of ATF3-6 engine nose-cowlings (intake) are material cracks that propagate as a result of various environmental factors.  Some of these include: vibration, corrosion, thermal fatigue and erosion.  These failures occur primarily at the nose lip rivet lines.  Past history shows that a complete or partial disassembly of the nose-cowling is necessary for thorough inspection and repair or replacement of damaged components.  During the last repair cycle Nose-Lip Assembly P/Ns 553-0169-1 or M20H5530169-1 were replaced with a 321 stainless steel assembly which has proven to meet the aircraft’s operational characteristics.   
2.0	OBJECTIVE
2.1	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 ATF3-6 nose-cowling assemblies.  Repaired nose-cowlings must meet the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM’s) form, fit and function specifications to ensure installation and operational characteristics are met. During the last repair cycle the Coast Guard started replacing the original aluminum nose lip (PNs 553-0169-1 or M20H5530169-1) with a nose lip manufactured from 321 stainless steel,: however, there may be some nose cowlings remaining in the Coast Guard supply system with the aluminum nose lip still installed.  The contractor shall replace the remaining nose lip assemblies with stainless steel and assign a new part number if applicable.  In addition, corrosion preventative measures shall be incorporated during the repair.
	Note:  Nose cowlings have several different parts numbers assigned and listed in the Coast Guard supply records.  Each part number is similar in design and function.  
The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair nose-cowlings.
The Coast Guard anticipates different levels of repairs: 
The offeror’s responsibilities to the Coast Guard consist of preparing and submitting a detailed work specification and cost breakdown structure for repair and ensure that all Coast Guard Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs) remain incorporated upon completion of work. Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.
The Coast Guard Aircraft Logistic Center Center’s (ALC) Medium Range Surveillance (MRS) Product Line and the selected offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance plan and service level agreements.
2.2	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria as part of their proposal package:
2.2.1	Technical
2.2.1.1	Provide detailed work specifications for nose-cowling repair.
2.2.1.2	Provide a written Performance plan that includes the repair turn around time
2.2.1.3	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.
2.2.1.4	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s form, fit and function characteristics.
2.2.1.5	Exterior paint scheme for the engine nose-cowling consists of an epoxy primer which meets MIL-PRF-23377 and top coated with Sherwin Williams Jet GLO Express product number Y05412, Federal Standard 595 color 17860 or equal. 
2.2.1.6	Temporary repairs are not permissible repairs for the purpose of this contract (e.g., stop drilling of cracks and external doublers).
2.2.1.7	Provide separate cost breakdowns for contractor proposed levels of repair (labor and parts inc the nose lip).
2.2.1.8	The contractor shall provide documentation describing material, weight and heat transfer properties of the nose lip, and assign a new part number.
2.2.2	Past Performance
2.2.2.1	Provide documentation for having performed repair of similar or like items.
2.2.2.2	Provide points of contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.
2.2.3	Certifications
2.2.3.1	Be certified by the FAA and have experience in repairing/overhaul of similar or like nose cowlings.  If the contractor for any reason looses its FAA certification during the period of performance; this constitutes a material breach of contract and may result in contract termination.  The contractor shall notify the Coast Guard’s Contracting Officer verbally and in writing no later then five (5) calendar days after certification forfeiture disclosing the events that caused such.
2.2.3.2	Provide copies of all certifications (e.g. FAA, OEM, ISO 9000, etc.)

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION  (48 CFR CHAPTER 1)
FAR 52.212-1  Instructions To Offerors Commercial Items (Jun 2008) ADDENDUM
SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.702(a)(1), the offeror shall submit a subcontracting plan along with any proposal which exceeds $500,000 and which has subcontracting possibilities. 
If the proposal exceed $500,000 and the offeror believes there are no subcontracting possibilities, the offeror should include with the proposal a letter so stating, along with supporting rationale. The plan shall comply with the requirements of FAR clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan. In accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause, upon acceptance by the Contracting Officer, the plan will be incorporated into the resultant contract. NOTE: SUBCONTRACTING PLANS ARE NOT REQUIRED FROM A SMALL BUSINESS OR FOREIGHN FIRMS.
FAR 52.212-2  Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999)  Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance.  The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.

&#61607;	The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the Coast Guard merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The SST, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:

o	Factor 1 –Technical/Management Solution/Approach
o	Factor 2 – Performance Measures and Metrics
o	Factor 3 – Past Performance
o	Factor 4 – Cost/Price
Factors 1, 2 and 3 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 4.  While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.  Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical, past performance and performance factors approach equality.

DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical Management/Solution/Approach
The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Offeror’s solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of Nose Cowling (repair).  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the offeror has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical management/solution/approach includes:
(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.
(b)	A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.
(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

&#61607;	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.

&#61607;	Clear lines of communication between the Contractor’s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.

&#61607;	Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.


(d)	The Offeror’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance, e.g., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications.
Factor 2:  Performance Measures and Metrics
The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:
(a)	Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,

(b)	Identify the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness,

(c)	Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.

Factor 3:  Past Performance
The past performance evaluation will examine how the Offeror’s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.
The past performance evaluation will also examine the Offeror’s actual performance on repair/overhaul of similar or like items.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.
Factor 4:  Cost/Price
Each Offeror’s cost/price quote will be evaluated based on the following:
(a)	Evaluation or proposed price/cost.  Offeror’s quote shall include a firm-fixed-price for each of the one-year ordering periods contained in the 3-year base & the 2-year option.  Note the requirement under technical 2.2.1.7 to price the nose lip separately.  This shall also be done for each of the base and option year periods.

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.

(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractor’s proposed cost/price proposal.  

The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor’s technical proposal.

		(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
			(A) The tax liability is finally determined.  The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.  A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.  In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
			(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.  A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.  A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
		(ii) Examples.  (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.  This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
			(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159.  The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.  The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
			(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.  The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  

If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  
The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE SPECIFICATIONS SECTION OF THE SOLICITATION IS MODIFIED TO REMOVE THE CAPATABILITY WITH MAC OSX.&nbsp; PLEASE SEE THE REVISED SOLICITATION IN THE ATTACHMENTS SECTION (25 JUNE 2009).</span></strong></p>
<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (25 JUNE 2009)</p>
<p>QUESTION 1:&nbsp; I have been unable to locate from my suppliers an external hard drive that fits the 32mb buffer speed and is both compatible with Windows and MAC OSX.&nbsp; Is this correct?</p>
<p>ANSWER 1:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The solicitation is being modified to reflect a change.&nbsp; The capability needed is with Windows, NOT Windows and MAC.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">___________________________________________________________</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE ZIP CODE&nbsp;UNDER CLIN 0001 OF THE SOLICITATION IS REVISED UNDER ATTACHMENT ONE.&nbsp; PLEASE SEE REVISED CHANGE PAGES (23 JUNE 2009)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;________________________________________________________________________</span></strong></p>
<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (23 JUNE 2009)</p>
<p>QUESTION 1: On the above Solicitation, it asks for Firewire 400 &amp; USB2.0 connectivity, but later on in the specs, it asks for 3.0GB/s speed which is available only through eSATA connectivity. Should these be bid as Quad-Interface drives to cover both eventualities?</p>
<p>ANSWER 1:&nbsp; Our requirements are for a minumum of triple connectivity:
<p>* Firewire 400<br />* USB 2.0<br />* eSATA</p>
<p>You may bid quad connectivity (which would presumably be adding Firewire 800 to the list of possibilities), but it is not required. Only the three specifications listed above are required.</p>
<p>QUESTION 3:&nbsp; Are you looking for a specific brand?</p>
<p>ANSWER 3:&nbsp; A specific brand is not required.&nbsp; As long as it meets all of our required specifications, then it is technically acceptable.&nbsp;</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Amendment A001, attached, is issued 6/25/09.  A list of the attendees at the pre-proposal conference held in Oklahoma City on June 19, 2009 has been posted.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for project management, engineering and installation/construction work for power systems and power system ancillary equipment and structures.  The engineering services include: site surveys, coordination studies, and design specifications and drawings.  The installation and construction work includes but is not limited to: Engine Generators (EG), fuel tanks, fuel systems, Uninterruptible Power Systems (UPS), power panels, Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC), equipment shelters, remote maintenance monitoring systems, and miscellaneous electrical work.  The general equipment size range, intended for installation, is: engine generators from 20 kW to 1,000 kW; UPS from 15 kVA up to 1,100 kVA.  
Work performed under this requirement will be replacement, enhancement and/or maintenance of existing power systems.  The majority of work will be replacement of power systems in existing facilities.  The facility size, and corresponding power service capacity, ranges from small sites with a 20 kW Engine Generator (EG) to consolidated critical power facilities with multiple 1 MW EGs.  The vast majority of sites have EGs in the small 100 kW to medium 500 kW range.  Approximately twenty-nine (29) sites can be classified as large critical power facilities.  The work at large critical power sites is more complex and involves a higher risk to the Air Traffic Control system than work performed at the smaller facilities.  The SOW differentiates work into two (2) categories; small-to-medium size facilities and large facilities.  The two categories are General National Air Space (GNAS) and Critical Power Distribution Systems (CPDS).
It is anticipated that Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity type contracts, with fixed priced pricing arrangements, will be awarded covering these services.  The resultant contracts will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.
"Q&A Open period."  Questions regarding the solicitation and/or Statement of Work shall be provided electronically to the Contracting Officer (connie.m.houpt@faa.gov) prior to June 12, 2009.
A pre-proposal conference will be held in Oklahoma City on June 19, 2009.  See SIR/RFO Provision L.8 Pre-proposal Conference, page 65.  Questions received during the Q&A open period will be addressed at the pre-proposal conference.  It is not necessary to attend the pre-proposal conference to submit a proposal or receive responses to the questions.  Q&As will be posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities website following the pre-proposal conference.  
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).  It is anticipated that up to eight contracts will be awarded as a result of this SIR/RFO.  This requirement has been partially set-aside for small businesses.  No more than two contracts will be awarded to large businesses and at least two contracts will be awarded to SEDB [8(a) certified] businesses with the remaining contracts being awarded within the small business program.  The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 238210 Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors.  The business size standard for this NAICS is $14 million.
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (July 9, 2009).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."
In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Complete submittals, both technical and cost proposals, must be received by the FAA, no later than 3:00 p.m. CST, Thursday, July 9, 2009.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Hand-delivered responses will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR/RFO could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for mail handling procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.
Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the solicitation process.
The FAA reserves the right to no longer consider on this acquisition, firms which fail to respond, firms with respond incompletely, or firms which respond with any information found to be verifiably false.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this announcement.
This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts. Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing. The maximum line of credit is $750,000.

GENERAL INFORMATION:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace and to identify qualified and capable sources.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.  Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities to meet requirements in the attached description.  The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy.  Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the Source List to be used when the solicitation for this requirement is issued, and will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) or Small Business, or open it up for full and open competition.  Any interested sources may respond to this market survey.  The information identified from this market survey may result in a restricted Screening Process when the RFP is issued.  All decisions will be made based on the information provided by vendors responding to this market survey.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for planning purposes only.

For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives.  Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level.  If at any level of indentation an Offers submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for a criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory), the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation.  Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level.  The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<BR><BR>(i) Outstanding: Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards.  The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.  Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  The offerors qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government.  The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract.  Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements.  There is a very high probability of success.<BR><BR>(ii) Above Average: Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to exceed performance or capability standards.  Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.  The offerors qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements.  The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government.  The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements.  Disadvantages are minimal.  There is a high probability of success.<BR><BR>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral): Information submitted demonstrate offerors potential to meet performance or capability standards.  The information represents an acceptable solution.  Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas.  A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved.  The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements.  No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral.  There is a good probability of success.<BR><BR>(iv) Marginal:  The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement.  The offerors interpretation of the Governments requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient.  The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement criteria requirements.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall submittal rating.  The offerors qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government.  There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable.  There are significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>(v) Unsatisfactory:  The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards.  Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal.  There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved.  The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Governments requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. There are very significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>5.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY-- NZAS051056C - Maintain Roofing, Multi Locations - Malmstrom AFB, MT
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Award Notice supersedes the award notice posted on 17 June 2009 under RFQ359555, Award FA4626-09-F-0005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RECOVERY Roofing Repair and Maintenance. A request for quote, Firm Fixed Price, was posted to GSA e-Buy on 15 May 2009 under RFQ 359555. This RFQ was canceled due to technical difficulties which resulted in its premature posting. The RFQ was re-posted to GSA e-Buy on 15 May 2009 under RFQ 363741. In accordance with FAR 13.104, Promoting Competition, eleven contractors were contacted via e-Buy to request quotes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This requirement was initially posted as a construction RFQ since the majority of the funding was for roof replacement. The GSA contracts for roof replacement and roof maintenance are covered under two different schedules; therefore, the RFQ was modified to only reflect the maintenance and inspection of 18 designated roofs. The construction requirement for roof replacement will be solicited at a later date. This major change to the solicitation caused the initial closing date of 22 May 2009 to be changed to 10 Jun 2009.</p>

<AWARDEE>UT-Battelle, LLC, P.O. Box 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 US
<DESC>The Recovery Action project entitled “Modernization of Laboratory Facilities (MLF)” involves the construction of a laboratory building, consisting of 120,000 to 160,000 gross square feet, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  This facility will provide modern, 21st-century laboratories, with associated space for support functions, for materials and chemical research and development use. The design will use modern, efficient lab planning benchmarks as the basis for determining the size and configuration of space types. The design of the facility will also emphasize more open, collaborative environments and flexibility to respond to future mission changes. In addition to the research laboratories, the facility will include lab offices for researchers, small group conference rooms, equipment areas, restrooms, circulation space, and any needed supporting infrastructure. The design will incorporate all current applicable codes; standards; best management practices; meet sustainability principles and environment, safety, and health (ES&H) features; and implement Integrated Safety Management at all levels in a new state-of-the-art facility.  This facility will be designed and built to meet LEED gold.  The DUNS number is 0991142870000.

Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:

As the Management and Operating (M&O) contractor, UT-Battelle is responsible for all activities at ORNL and the facilities located at the site.  The Statement of Work (SOW) for the ORNL M&O contract primarily addresses the conduct of basic and applied research and development (R&D) to advance scientific knowledge, the nation’s energy resources, national security and environmental quality and to strengthen educational foundations and national economic competitiveness.  However, also included in the SOW are requirements for many other non-R&D types of work consistent with the Department of Energy’s mission.  The work referenced in this synopsis has been reviewed by the Contracting Officer and determined to be within existing scope.  UT-Battelle anticipates numerous subcontracting opportunities for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funded projects and plans to conduct competitive, fixed-price procurements for much of the work.  Many of the subcontracting opportunities will be directed at small businesses.

<AWARDEE>The Research Corporation of the University of Hawaii, Inc. (RCUH)
<DESC>This contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only the University of Hawaii (UH) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is funding development of a comprehensive web-based ocean wave forecasting tool at the UH School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST). ONR chose SOEST because it offers integrated expertise in Geology and Resources Engineering, and Geophysics, Meteorology, Ocean and Resources Engineering, and Oceanography. The objective of this tool is to deliver extreme event and multiyear hindcasting for any site around the world, and includes ETOPO 1 (or user defined) bathymetry to allow for coastal refraction. The immediate deliverable from this subject study is estimates of storm waves at a site associated iwth an actual Navy design project. But furthermore, and equally importantly, tasking this specifically to the UH provides them and ONR with a valuable real-world Navy test case regarding the utility of this developmental tool. The work includes, but is not limited to, performing ocean wave simulation and refraction studies for representative extreme events in the vicinity of the subject site, including statistical evaluation of the results.

<DESC>PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE INFORMATION

JUSTIFIATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION - DUFFEL, BAG NYLON

1.  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Clothing & Textiles is the contracting activity.

2.  The action being approved is the ability to solicit for DLA requirements on an other than full and open competition basis.

3.  The following are the supplies required to meet DLA’s needs: 

Item:  Duffel, Bag, Nylon   PGC:  17632
NSN:  8465-01-117-8699
Quantity:   75,000 Each
Unit Price:  $18.71
Estimated Dollar Value: $1, 403,250.00

4.  The applicable statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(2), FAR Part 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.

5. The use of this authority is necessary to ensure a continuous supply of duffel bags for all incoming recruits and deploying troops during the upcoming summer months.  The current supply situation is insufficient to meet the fluctuating demands for duffel bags.  The fluctuation in demand for this item over the last year and a half has exceeded the production capacity of the current supplier of this item, SNC Telecommunications (SPM1C1-09-D-0014).  The monthly demand in February 2008 was 44,231 and the monthly demand in May 2009 rose to 70,863, with a spike in demand of 92,662 in December 2008.  Although  SNC Telecommunications has been gradually increasing their monthly deliveries to 80,000 per month to meet demands, it was insufficient to avoid the current backorder situation.  The proposed urgent procurement will augment the current supply situation and ensure a continuous supply of duffel bags until the first deliveries from a proposed long-term contract begins in September 2009.  

The current supply position of this item is as follows:

Average Monthly Demand:  70,863 ea.
Stock on Hand: 88,544
Backorders:  87,324
Due In:  267,000 
 
The proposed urgent acquisition of 75,000 Duffel Bags will have a production lead-time of forty-five (45) days.  Initial delivery for a quantity of 20,000 each is due 45  days after date of award,  (two) monthly increments of 20,000 each, and another (one) monthly  increment of 15,000 each.  If this 
procurement is not awarded by 31 May 2009, DSCP will not be able to meet all customer demands because stock on hand from July thru October  2009 will only be at 0.2-0.3 months of stock.  


JUSTIFIATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION - DUFFEL, BAG NYLON


Furthermore, if demand forecasts are higher than Manugistics projections, DSCP will not be able to meet customer demand  and will have zero stock on hand from July through October 2009.  The Army is the primary user and has various ship to locations, however, delivery orders will be issued to one delivery destination, Lion Vallen, who acts as a Third Party Logistics Center for the Clothing and Textile Supply chain and will expedite the receipt of goods and ship the required quantity to the customer.

6.  Due to the unusual and compelling urgency, this acquisition will not  be advertised in FedBizOpps as permitted by FAR 5.202(a)(2).  The firm to be solicited for this exigency is a proven military supplier of Duffel Bags and numerous Clothing and Textile items required by DSCP:    D. J. Manufacturing Corp.  This firm has successfully manufactured this item for ten (10) years as an 8(a) contractor and more recently as a Subcontractor for SNC who is presently fulfilling the Governments requirements.

7..The undersigned Contracting Officer hereby determines that  the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on price analyses and historical pricing (determined fair and reasonable from certified cost and pricing data).  Cost and pricing information will not be required in accordance with FAR 15.403-1 (C ) (iii).  

8.  An informal market survey was conducted with the two proven Duffel Bag manufacturers, DJ Manufacturing Corp., and SNC Telecommunications.    D.J.’s  accelerated production capacity was obtained to guarantee coverage of the urgent requirement in the desired time frame.  SNC stated they are at full capacity, per email dated 29 April 2009 and will not be able to provide coverage on this requirement.

9.  There is no substitute item available.  The Duffel Bag is an integral part of the Warfighter’s requirement and is used by deploying forces.  The subject item is in a critical supply status due to the Army’s increased demands from FY 08   to FY 09.  The current quantities on contract with  SNC are inadequate to satisfy the supply deficit.  Failure to provide this item will impair the Army’s combat readiness.

10.  Only D.J. Manufacturing Corp. will be given the opportunity to offer on this procurement.  There is insufficient time to conduct a formal market survey to determine if any other sources are capable of providing the end items in the required time period.


11.  The quantity procured under this exigency acquisition is sufficient to satisfy the immediate requirement until deliveries are received from the proposed NISH contract.  With the current 8(a) and proposed mandatory procurement due ins, requirements will be satisfied.

Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The Network 22 Logistics Office, 5901 E. 7th Street, Long Beach, California, as requested by the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, shall enter into a service contract that requires justification for other than full and open competition.2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  Sole source contractor shall provide services for a new and complete short-circuit study, equipment-interrupting or withstand evaluation, and a protective device coordination study for the electrical system at Building 299 for the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System.3. Description of Requirement: VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System is requesting sole source service contract from Giga Electrical and Technical Services, Inc., 4515 Eagle Rock Blvd, Suite 142, Los Angeles, CA 90041.  The period of performance shall be 12 weeks from the date of award.  The estimated annual cost is $81,540.00. 4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The service being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR Part 6.302-1(b), Only One Responsible Source.5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: Giga Electrical and Technical Services performed the initial analysis of the previous switchgear equipment in building 299.  Giga is uniquely qualified because of the technical knowledge, skills and track record of excellent performance in the most difficult part of the field of electrical engineering. This system is particularly complex because of the preferred and emergency configurations that can change throughout the system. Giga is fully prepared to provide an analysis of all configurations and cross connections of this large and complex system. No other company is capable of completing this project in time in order for the required settings to be available on startup of the new equipment time is of the essence on this emergency repair. The new switchgear equipment is due to be installed by the end of September. It is imperative that this study be completed prior to this installation. The facility requires the settings to be accurate as well as available at the time of the new switchgear equipment start up.Giga has certain proprietary information from prior work that they are building upon, which is the reason that they can perform this study with such a quick turn-around time.Gathering the information that they (Giga) have accumulated to this point would require a team of engineers at least 6 months to inspect the entire north campus electrical system, including all of the underground distribution following the route of the 8 main electrical circuits to every building on the north campus checking every cable, switchboard, panel board, and motor control center. VA Greater Los Angeles cannot afford to delay the project for 6 months. This would require additional funds to rent a temporary switchgear and risk interruption of electrical services. This part of the project is every bit an emergency as the switchgear equipment replacement of the substation. Replacement of the switchgear equipment was procured under an emergency basis and DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS NETWORK 22 LOGISTICS OFFICEJUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONFAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)ELECTRICAL STUDY"                                                                   VA-262-09-RQ-0374replacement and installation is currently underway. Successful and efficient installation has been determined to be vital to patient care. Interruption in this equipment could result in loss of electrical power, which would have possible catastrophic consequences.Giga Electrical and Technical Services is able to provide this vital service in the time frame required, thus minimizing cost to the Government and safeguarding property and life.6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  See number 5 above.  A Pre-solicitation Notice was transmitted to the GPE (Fedbizzopps). 7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost has been determined to be fair and reasonable to the government based on the using service estimate and past prices paid for similar services.8. Results of Market Survey: Market research information was also obtained by other contractors and through historical data.  See Items 5 above. 9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Items 5 above.10. Any Other Interested Sources There are no other sources that expressed in writing an interest in the service other than the incumbent who cannot perform the requirements.  See Item 5.  11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: None. See Paragraph 2, 3, 4, and 5 above.12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.____________________________Chelsea Black						Contract Specialist

<DESC>The Radar and Antenna Systems Division 4.5.5 Facilities for RCS and Antenna Measurements (FARM) is made up of both outdoor antenna ranges and anechoic chambers that are used in conducting antenna measurements. Building 2193 outdoor range uses an automated antenna measurements system developed by Orbit/FR that consists of both hardware and software to conduct antenna measurements. This system is the Orbit FR959 Antenna Pattern Data Acquisition and Analysis System. The system includes hardware from Orbit/FR and their channel partner Agilent Technologies. All the hardware is controlled by  software from Orbit/FR. The Agilent 8530 RF receiver and multi-channel controller is now obsolete and no longer supported by Agilent. The Agilent RF receiver will be replaced with an existing government Agilent PNA network Analyzer and the Agilent multi-channel controller will be replaced with an Orbit/FR 9800 High Speed Switch Controller. This procurement will also include RF cables, software drivers, PC controllers, training, manuals and installation of the new equipment with the existing system.
