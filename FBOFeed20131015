Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and Ability One. The required delivery is 172 days.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed.

This will be a full and open competitive procurement.  The scope of work consists of the following:

This construction project provides an addition and renovation to a portion of the existing Galley, and a separate cold storage warehouse to support the galley at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti (CLDJ), Africa.
  A front addition to the Galley, approximately 506 m2 (5,447 SF), shall expand the seating area and restrooms, requiring the removal of the portion of existing facility's facade.

It shall also include modifications to the receiving area for food shipments. Once the rear addition is completed, a portion of the existing kitchen area, approximately 66 m2 (710 SF), shall be modified to provide spaces for a general preparation area and additional storage for the Galley. 

The Cold Storage Warehouse shall be a stand-alone new structure, approximately 1,173 m2 (12,626 SF), in the industrial area of the camp,  mile away.
  The facility shall provide additional refrigerated, frozen, and dry storage spaces for galley items, and an office and restroom.

The work includes the furnishing of all labor, management, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to construct a P-218 Galley and Cold Storage Warehouse at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, Africa.   Work will include selective site demolition, concrete foundations and slabs, concrete walls, metal panel walls and roofing, steel structure, fireproofing, modified bitumen roofing, aluminum windows and storefront entries, blast resistant door and window assemblies, metal stud and gypsum board walls, interior finishes, steel doors, wood doors, metal stairs, electrical power and lighting, communications (public address, intrusion detection, mass notification, electronic access control, and others), HVAC systems, plumbing systems, fire sprinkler and alarm systems, smoke detection, fireproofing, potable water service lines with meters and backflow preventers, underground electric power service, pedestrian sidewalk paving, exterior lighting, storm drainage system, and incidental related work.

This project will be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract. The Government reserves the right to enter into negotiations or limit the competitive range. The magnitude of construction is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. 

This contract will require a Performance Bond pursuant to FAR 52.228-15, through an approved surety under the United States Treasury Department Circular 570.

The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available for viewing and downloading on or about 8 April 2013.

The solicitation will be formatted as an RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.203 for a negotiated procurement utilizing procedures of FAR 36.2. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.

The technical evaluation factors are anticipated to be as follows: Corporate Experience, Past Performance, and Safety.
 

A site visit to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti will be available for this procurement. Due to the geographic location of this site, it is recommended that interested firms make pre-arrangements for travel (immunizations, etc.), base access and any other necessary requirements for overseas travel, as the solicitation will be limited to 30 days.

<p>1.5 The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511. The small business size standard is $25.5M.<br /><br />2.0 Background</p>
<p>In prior years, a commercial version of the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) was modified and developed to create an "AFTAC Specific CAMx" tool to evaluate photochemical transport and diffusion model to gain insight into ambient characterization of the environment. Specifically, the software allows for integrated assessment of gaseous and particulate air-pollution over many scales ranging from urban to super-regional. The software contains a modular architecture which facilitates adaptability of other applications, multi-platform configuration, and state-of-the-art photochemistry and transport and diffusion algorithms. Modifications to the software require the developer to apply the model to ambient characterization of selected field test and site locations, and provide field tests and experiments. Software input/output file formats are based on the Urban Air shed Model, and are therefore compatible with many existing pre- and post-processing tools.<br /><br />Contract actions require the ability to:</p>
<p>1. Provide development of CAMx and Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).<br />2. Provide photochemical kinetics technical support.<br />3. Provide test, evaluation, enhancements, and support for air quality systems.<br />4. Provide CAMx modeling of tracer experiments.<br />5. Provide analysis of data from field test experiments.<br />6. Provide gridded emissions inventories for selected locations.<br />7. Provide field test management services, assistance and guidance for upcoming field test experiments.<br />8. Provide CAMx photochemistry, aerometric modeling, and data analysis research and support.<br />9. Provide support or other development service as requested.<br />10. Provide Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) support.<br />11. Provide CAMx software maintenance support.<br />12. Develop and produce technical documentation required under a particular Task Order.<br />13. Work performed under this contract may be O&amp;M or Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E). <br /><br />This is a 5-year, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Sources Sought Notice:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Seeking Sources for Inclusion of Colorimetric Explosive Detection Kits in the Explosive Detection Equipment-User Scenario Evaluation (EDE-USE)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NSWC IHEODTD) is seeking Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and near COTS colorimetric kits capable of detecting trace and small bulk (less than one gram) explosives. Detection capabilities should include, but not be limited to, commercial and military explosives, as well as Home Made Explosives (HME) such as urea nitrate, ammonium nitrate mixtures, and potassium chlorate mixtures. Detection systems should be designed for, or able to operate in, an indoor or field environment.<br /><br />Colorimetric detection kits are traditionally used for presumptive screening of personnel and objects at security checkpoints or other locations. In some cases, these checkpoints may be located outdoors and/or in harsh environments. Systems operating in these environments are expected to perform their function (explosive detection) effectively and consistently, even in the presence of moisture or temperature.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The purpose of this sources sought notice (SSN) is to seek out equipment that uses colorimetric technology enabling personnel to collect, analyze, and detect/identify trace and small bulk amounts of explosives. The SSN solicits vendors' information that fully explains their existing technology features, capabilities, and performance. NSWC IHEODTD plans to select colorimetric explosive detection systems to be included in a user scenario evaluation. Following completion of said evaluation, a final report will be written and available for use by government agencies, Department of Defense services, and law enforcement organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Users with various duties related to various aspects of explosive detection or explosive ordnance disposal will be participating in this evaluation. The users will be provided training for the colorimetric kit, to be conducted by the manufacturer. Subsequently, the users will be asked to assess a variety of scenarios based on real-world threats using their training. The scenarios will include threat items consisting of trace or small bulk explosive material deposited onto a variety of surfaces. Once the scenario is completed, the user will be requested to complete a survey evaluating the performance, applicability, and usefulness of the kit as well as the training received. </span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">A maximum of two manufacturer representatives are asked to be onsite in conjunction with this evaluation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These representatives will conduct the training session and receive feedback from the users after each scenario.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If selected for inclusion in testing, the manufacturer shall provide advance transcripts of the training session to IHEODTD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Manufacturer representatives will not be allowed to interact with the users during the scenarios.</span></p>

            7.1. GENERAL 
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. 

                      7.2 ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
a.	 A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 
b.	 All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

       VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE 
a.	 Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). 

b.	VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the     contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. 
c.	Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization.

e.	     The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 
f.	 If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 
g.	If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
l.

Violation of the Privacy Act may involve the imposition of criminal and civil penalties. 
g.	The contractor/subcontractor agrees to: 
(1) Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations issued under   the Act in the design, development, or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically identifies: 
(a) The Systems of Records (SOR); and 
(b) The design, development, or operation work that the contractor/subcontractor is to perform; 
(2) Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals that is subject to the Privacy Act; and

h.	 In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function. For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the contractor/subcontractor is considered to be an employee of the agency. 
 (1) "Operation of a System of Records" means performance of any of the activities associated      with maintaining the SOR, including the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of records. 
(2) "Record" means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and contains the person's name, or identifying number, symbol, or any other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint, or a photograph. 
(3) "System of Records" means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual. 
i.	The vendor shall ensure the security of all procured or developed systems and technologies, including their subcomponents (hereinafter referred to as "Systems"), throughout the life of this contract and any extension, warranty, or maintenance periods. This includes, but is not limited to workarounds, patches, hotfixes, upgrades, and any physical components (hereafter referred to as Security Fixes) which may be necessary to fix all security vulnerabilities published or known to the vendor anywhere in the Systems, including Operating Systems and firmware. The vendor shall ensure that Security Fixes shall not negatively impact the Systems. 
j.	 The vendor shall notify VA within 24 hours of the discovery or disclosure of successful exploits of the vulnerability which can compromise the security of the Systems (including the confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system). Such issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, but in no event longer than ____ days. 
k.	 When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to the VA that the patch has been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days. When the vendor is responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes within ____ days. 
l.	 All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure. Exceptions to this paragraph (e.g. for the convenience of VA) shall only be granted with approval of the contracting officer and the VA Assistant Secretary for Office of Information and Technology. 

    INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE 
a.	For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerability scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The contractor's security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation. 
b.	 Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII. 
c.	 Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks. 
d.	The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process. The contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with contractor/subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary. 
e.	The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor. The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost. 
f.	 VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor-owned equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA-approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.
g.	 All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract. 
h.	Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are: 
(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive;                                                                                  (2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed  in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or 
(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost  at time of    purchase.
(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then; 
(a) The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and 
(b)any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies /methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre-approved and described in the purchase order or contract.
(c) A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation. 

 SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION 
a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. 
b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. 
c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 
d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident. 

                7.7 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH 
a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 
b.	The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. 
c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following: 
(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access); 
(2) Description of the event, including: 
(a) date of occurrence; 
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code; (3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected; 
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected:
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected; 
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text; 
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); 
(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any; 
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals; 
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and 
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. 
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $______ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
(1) Notification; 
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports; 
(3) Data breach analysis; 
(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; 
(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and 
(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs. 
  SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING 
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time. 
    TRAINING 
a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems: 
(1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems; 
(2) Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training; 
(3) Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and 
(4) Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.] 
b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. 
c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI)<br /><br />The 421st SCMS/GUMBA of the United States Air Force (USAF), Tinker Air Force Base, OK, is submitting this Request for Information (RFI) with the intent of determining if delivery requirements for the repair of the F-108 Turbine Clearance Control Valve (TCCV) are realistic and obtainable. This RFI is based on strategy changes implemented by the cognizant engineering authority. This strategy increases the repair capacity required as the percentage of replacement is increased. Through this RFI the USAF is conducting market research to establish realistic delivery requirements for the Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The USAF is determining if industry capability and capacity is available to meet the increased demand for the repair of the TCCV. The determination will be based on industry's ability to meet delivery of 12 - 15 each per month. The required delivery schedule would be for a quantity of 3 each per week until the total monthly delivery of 12 - 15 each is met.</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to respond with either positive or negative comments which will help the USAF in establishing this requirement. Parties are also encouraged to provide a better solution to meet the increased demand should it be determined that the delivery schedule is unrealistic.</p>
<p>Please provide all responses to Ann Redwine via email at ann.redwine@us.af.mil. Should you have any questions or need further information please call Ann at 405 734-4613.</p>
<p>THE INFORMATION REQUESTED THROUGH THIS RFI IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY</p>

Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c.

Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.<br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>
<p>(xi) Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) "Work Orders" is added as follows: Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. <br>  <br> Contracting Officer (KO): A duly appointed individual with the authority to enter into, administer and terminate contracts on behalf of the Government. Only the KO can legally commit the Government and, as the Government's agent, modify the Contract/Order. The KO is the final authority for determining adequacy of the Contractor's performance. KO decisions arising under or relating to the contact are final.  <br>  <br>  Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) - An individual designated in writing by the KO to perform specific technical and administrative functions within the scope and limitations of their written appointment (e.g., surveillance of Contractor's performance, accept services).  The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or authorize any changes to the order/contract or in any way obligate additional funds by the Government; such authority rests solely with the KO. The COR for this contract will be located in Kuwait. <br>  <br> 4.  METHODS OF SURVEILLANCE.  Simplified methods of surveillance will be used by the Government to evaluate contractor performance. The primary methods of surveillance are periodic inspections to determine if the contractor is providing vehicles that meet contract requirements. <br>  <br> Periodic Inspections - The COR will perform an inspection on a monthly basis and upon completion of the services.   <br>  <br> 5.  QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA) SURVEILLANCE TASKS.  <br> a. The COR will perform surveillance on all services required of the contractor either through periodic inspection of the vehicles or the use of objective quality evidence (i.e. customer feedback or evaluation of contractor supplied performance data), and will ensure all required services of the Contract/Order are properly executed.    <br>  <br> b. The COR will immediately report any noted contractual deficiencies to the Contractor and the KO, to include date, specific contract requirement, deficiency, request for contractor corrective action and suspense date.  When Contractor contractual performance deficiencies are noted increased periodic inspections will take place to assure contract compliance. <br>  <br> c. The COR will re-inspect services that were found deficient. Failure to complete corrective actions will be reported immediately to the KO for further action. <br>  <br> d. Upon satisfactory completion of the work, the COR will accept the services provided and authorize payment, by approving the Contractor's invoice and completing a receiving report. <br>   <br> 6.  DOCUMENTATION.  When services are provided IAW the Contract/Order it is not uncommon for a low dollar value and low complexity and/or duration service to be performed without any remedial actions required by the Government.  Based on the low dollar value and the low complexity and/or duration of the Contract/Order, documentation will be kept to a minimum.  Documentation of COR surveillance of contractor performance will include memos for record that include date, type of surveillance, what was observed, and results. The COR must forward all records they maintained to the KO after accepting the Contractor's services for use in the event of a future contract claim/dispute. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

Award of Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Orders shall be made on a competitive basis, using the  quote mark best-value Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote mark  process.  The Government intends to award a minimum of two (2)  and a maximum of six (6) Purchase Orders depending upon the availability of funds. <br>  <br> 2.  The LPTA process does not permit tradeoffs between price and non-price factors in accordance with FAR Part 15; thus, the Government will award to responsible vendors who meet or exceed the acceptability standards for non-price factors with the lowest evaluated price.  The evaluation factors are listed below. <br>  <br> Factor 1 - Technical Capability <br> Factor 2 - Past Performance <br> Factor 3 - Price <br>  <br> 3.  The Government evaluators will not assume that the vendor's quote possesses any capability or knowledge unless it is specified in the quote.   <br>  <br> 4.  The Government intends to evaluate and award Purchase Orders without discussions.  However, the Government reserves the  right to conduct discussions.  If discussion are required, they will be conducted with vendors in the competitive range to the extent deemed necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer IAW FAR 15.306. <br>  <br> 5.  If any of the above non-price factors receives an individual rating of  quote mark Unacceptable, quote mark  the vendor's quote will deemed  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  and removed from further consideration.  Only quotes receiving an overall rating of  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  will be considered for award. <br>  <br> (b) EVALUATION CRITERIA <br>  <br> 1.  Factor 1 - Technical Capability <br>  <br> The vendor's quote will be evaluated to the degree to which the vendor's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide litters with the requested technicalcapabilities,specifications, salient characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum essential characteristics.  The degree to which the Offeror's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide delivery and training as stated in the Statement of Need. The degree to which the training package demonstrates to the Government a clear understanding of each system must be met. The degree in which the systems parts list will be clear and complete so that the Government will have a full understanding of what makes up each system.  Table 1 identifies the ratings for Factor 1. <br>  <br> Table 1:  Factor 1 Ratings <br> Rating	           Description <br> Acceptable ---   Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. <br> Unacceptable --- Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.   <br>  <br> 2.  Factor 2 - Past Performance <br>  <br> a.  The past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the vendor's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in services that meets the requirements of the Statement of Need.  The Government will conduct a past performance risk evaluation that will be based on the quality, relevance, and currency of the Offeror's past performance on products and services of similar size, scope, and complexity within similar periods of performance as it related to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.   A purchase order or contract of similar nature is a contract of comparable risk - functions, responsibilities, and control exercised by the Contractor which is essentially the same as required under the Request for Quote solicitation. <br>  <br> b.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of demonstrating relevancy of the past performance and expectation based on the relevant past performance that the requirements will successfully be performed rests with the Offeror.  Other sources available to the Government include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).  The vendor must provide a list of 3 references of relevant past and present contracts for Federal, State and/or City agencies and commercial customers within the past 3 years.   quote mark Relevant quote mark  is defined as like items as stated in this solicitation's Statement of Work in terms of similar characteristics and quantities.  References must include: <br>  <br> Name of the Organization that will be providing the reference,  <br> Name of the Point of Contact (POC),  <br> POC Telephone Number, <br> POC Email address,  <br> Contract Number,  <br> Period of Performance, and <br> Description of goods/services rendered.  <br>  <br> c.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the Offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. <br>  <br> Table 2:  Factor 2 Ratings <br> Rating	        Description <br> Acceptable ---  Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance record is unknown. <br> Unacceptable --- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to succesffuly perform the required effort. <br>  <br>  <br> 3.  Factor 3 - Price <br>  <br> Price will be evaluated separately from past performance and other non-price factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.  The total evaluated price will be evaluated for reasonableness in terms of: <br>  <br> 3.1.  Consistency with the requirement's acceptable technical capabilities in the vendor's technical quote;  <br>  <br> 3.2.  Price quote evaluation is to determine whether vendor's price quote is fair and reasonable, the Government will evaluate the completeness and reasonableness of vendor's price quote.  The Procuring Contracting Officer may conduct a cost analysis to support the price determination using Contract Pricing Reference Guide (https://acc.dau.mil/cprg). <br>  <br> 3.3.  Option Items.  The Government will evaluate quotes for Purchase Orders award purposes by adding the total price for option item to the total price of the basic requirement for each  product type.   The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the quote for option prices is significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.  <br>  <br> (end of provision) <br>  <br> 52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2012) <br> 52.247-29 	F.O.B. Origin 	FEB 2006  <br>  <br> EXPORT CONTRACT ACT COMPLIANCE (DEC 2006) (USAMRAA) <br>  <br> 52.217-9     OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) <br>  <br> (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within  30 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least  60  days before the contract expires.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS (IF &gt;$25K)</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>China Air Quality Management Program Feasibility Study<br />USTDA Activity No. 2013-61030A</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an air quality management program based on U.S. best practices and technologies. The project will also disseminate information on U.S. clean air technologies in this sector through a series of workshops tied to the air quality management plan development.</p>
<p>The project, developed in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), will assist China's Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) to meet their goals for reducing air pollution across the country through developing an air quality management plan based on U.S. best practices and technologies.  MEP has identified 10 regions of China as priority areas for remediating air pollution and this project will target one of these; specifically, Jiangsu province. The project will work with EPA and MEP, as well as officials from the Jiangsu EPB, to develop a model regional air quality plan.  This plan will reflect and adapt best practices of U.S. air quality management programs and regulations, as well as highlight appropriate U.S. advanced pollution assessment and control technologies based on the priority pollution sources.  Further, the study will include an assessment of the source of pollutants, including industrial processes such as chemical and electricity production, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and transportation.  Based on these findings, the program will hold a series of training workshops in developing the model air quality plan that would highlight relevant U.S. companies and technologies. These trainings will help disseminate the information to other Chinese cities and regions to assist them in developing air quality plans and enhancing capacity to implement plans and programs to reduce PM2.5 and other air pollution (e.g., ozone).</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $842,584 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 4:00 PM, NOVEMBER 28, 2013</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ??Principal,?? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror??s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as:THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 48HRS PRIOR TO CLOSING.

Open Solicitation for SF 330s (we are currently in this step, and will conduct an evaluation of all SF 330s received)<br />2. Closed Request for Proposal (the RFP will be limited to the firms selected in the SF 330 evaluation)<br /><br />Prior to the shutdown, we anticipated completing Step 1 in mid-November, and issuing the RFPs in early December.&nbsp; However, with the limits currently imposed upon us, I anticipate our planned schedule will be delayed by 2-4 weeks.<br />***END UPDATE***

Award of Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Orders shall be made on a competitive basis, using the  quote mark best-value Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote mark  process.  The Government intends to award a minimum of two (2)  and a maximum of six (6) Purchase Orders depending upon the availability of funds.  <br>    <br>  2.  The LPTA process does not permit tradeoffs between price and non-price factors in accordance with FAR Part 15; thus, the Government will award to responsible vendors who meet or exceed the acceptability standards for non-price factors with the lowest evaluated price.  The evaluation factors are listed below.  <br>    <br>  Factor 1 - Technical Capability  <br>  Factor 2 - Past Performance  <br>  Factor 3 - Price  <br>    <br>  3.  The Government evaluators will not assume that the vendor's quote possesses any capability or knowledge unless it is specified in the quote.    <br>    <br>  4.  The Government intends to evaluate and award Purchase Orders without discussions.  However, the Government reserves the  right to conduct discussions.  If discussion are required, they will be conducted with vendors in the competitive range to the extent deemed necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer IAW FAR 15.306.  <br>    <br>  5.  If any of the above non-price factors receives an individual rating of  quote mark Unacceptable, quote mark  the vendor's quote will deemed  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  and removed from further consideration.  Only quotes receiving an overall rating of  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  will be considered for award.  <br>    <br>  (b) EVALUATION CRITERIA  <br>    <br>  1.  Factor 1 - Technical Capability  <br>    <br>  The vendor's quote will be evaluated to the degree to which the vendor's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide litters with the requested technicalcapabilities,specifications, salient characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum essential characteristics.  The degree to which the Offeror's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide delivery and training as stated in the Statement of Need. The degree to which the training package demonstrates to the Government a clear understanding of each system must be met. The degree in which the systems parts list will be clear and complete so that the Government will have a full understanding of what makes up each system.  Table 1 identifies the ratings for Factor 1.  <br>    <br>  Table 1:  Factor 1 Ratings  <br>  Rating	           Description  <br>  Acceptable ---   Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br>  Unacceptable --- Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.    <br>    <br>  2.  Factor 2 - Past Performance  <br>    <br>  a.  The past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the vendor's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in services that meets the requirements of the Statement of Need.  The Government will conduct a past performance risk evaluation that will be based on the quality, relevance, and currency of the Offeror's past performance on products and services of similar size, scope, and complexity within similar periods of performance as it related to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.   A purchase order or contract of similar nature is a contract of comparable risk - functions, responsibilities, and control exercised by the Contractor which is essentially the same as required under the Request for Quote solicitation.  <br>    <br>  b.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of demonstrating relevancy of the past performance and expectation based on the relevant past performance that the requirements will successfully be performed rests with the Offeror.  Other sources available to the Government include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).  The vendor must provide a list of 3 references of relevant past and present contracts for Federal, State and/or City agencies and commercial customers within the past 3 years.   quote mark Relevant quote mark  is defined as like items as stated in this solicitation's Statement of Work in terms of similar characteristics and quantities.  References must include:  <br>    <br>  Name of the Organization that will be providing the reference,   <br>  Name of the Point of Contact (POC),   <br>  POC Telephone Number,  <br>  POC Email address,   <br>  Contract Number,   <br>  Period of Performance, and  <br>  Description of goods/services rendered.   <br>    <br>  c.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the Offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.  <br>    <br>  Table 2:  Factor 2 Ratings  <br>  Rating	        Description  <br>  Acceptable ---  Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance record is unknown.  <br>  Unacceptable --- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to succesffuly perform the required effort.  <br>    <br>    <br>  3.  Factor 3 - Price  <br>    <br>  Price will be evaluated separately from past performance and other non-price factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.  The total evaluated price will be evaluated for reasonableness in terms of:  <br>    <br>  3.1.  Consistency with the requirement's acceptable technical capabilities in the vendor's technical quote;   <br>    <br>  3.2.  Price quote evaluation is to determine whether vendor's price quote is fair and reasonable, the Government will evaluate the completeness and reasonableness of vendor's price quote.  The Procuring Contracting Officer may conduct a cost analysis to support the price determination using Contract Pricing Reference Guide (https://acc.dau.mil/cprg).  <br>    <br>  3.3.  Option Items.  The Government will evaluate quotes for Purchase Orders award purposes by adding the total price for option item to the total price of the basic requirement for each  product type.   The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the quote for option prices is significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.   <br>    <br>  (end of provision)  <br>    <br>  52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2012)  <br>  52.247-29 	F.O.B.

Award of Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Orders shall be made on a competitive basis, using the  quote mark best-value Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote mark  process.  The Government intends to award a minimum of two (2)  and a maximum of six (6) Purchase Orders depending upon the availability of funds.   <br>      <br>   2.  The LPTA process does not permit tradeoffs between price and non-price factors in accordance with FAR Part 15; thus, the Government will award to responsible vendors who meet or exceed the acceptability standards for non-price factors with the lowest evaluated price.  The evaluation factors are listed below.   <br>      <br>   Factor 1 - Technical Capability   <br>   Factor 2 - Past Performance   <br>   Factor 3 - Price   <br>      <br>   3.  The Government evaluators will not assume that the vendor's quote possesses any capability or knowledge unless it is specified in the quote.     <br>      <br>   4.  The Government intends to evaluate and award Purchase Orders without discussions.  However, the Government reserves the  right to conduct discussions.  If discussion are required, they will be conducted with vendors in the competitive range to the extent deemed necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer IAW FAR 15.306.   <br>      <br>   5.  If any of the above non-price factors receives an individual rating of  quote mark Unacceptable, quote mark  the vendor's quote will deemed  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  and removed from further consideration.  Only quotes receiving an overall rating of  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  will be considered for award.   <br>      <br>   (b) EVALUATION CRITERIA   <br>      <br>   1.  Factor 1 - Technical Capability   <br>      <br>   The vendor's quote will be evaluated to the degree to which the vendor's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide litters with the requested technicalcapabilities,specifications, salient characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum essential characteristics.  The degree to which the Offeror's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide delivery and training as stated in the Statement of Need. The degree to which the training package demonstrates to the Government a clear understanding of each system must be met. The degree in which the systems parts list will be clear and complete so that the Government will have a full understanding of what makes up each system.  Table 1 identifies the ratings for Factor 1.   <br>      <br>   Table 1:  Factor 1 Ratings   <br>   Rating	           Description   <br>   Acceptable ---   Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.   <br>   Unacceptable --- Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.     <br>      <br>   2.  Factor 2 - Past Performance   <br>      <br>   a.  The past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the vendor's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in services that meets the requirements of the Statement of Need.  The Government will conduct a past performance risk evaluation that will be based on the quality, relevance, and currency of the Offeror's past performance on products and services of similar size, scope, and complexity within similar periods of performance as it related to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.   A purchase order or contract of similar nature is a contract of comparable risk - functions, responsibilities, and control exercised by the Contractor which is essentially the same as required under the Request for Quote solicitation.   <br>      <br>   b.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of demonstrating relevancy of the past performance and expectation based on the relevant past performance that the requirements will successfully be performed rests with the Offeror.  Other sources available to the Government include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).  The vendor must provide a list of 3 references of relevant past and present contracts for Federal, State and/or City agencies and commercial customers within the past 3 years.   quote mark Relevant quote mark  is defined as like items as stated in this solicitation's Statement of Work in terms of similar characteristics and quantities.  References must include:   <br>      <br>   Name of the Organization that will be providing the reference,    <br>   Name of the Point of Contact (POC),    <br>   POC Telephone Number,   <br>   POC Email address,    <br>   Contract Number,    <br>   Period of Performance, and   <br>   Description of goods/services rendered.    <br>      <br>   c.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the Offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.   <br>      <br>   Table 2:  Factor 2 Ratings   <br>   Rating	        Description   <br>   Acceptable ---  Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance record is unknown.   <br>   Unacceptable --- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to succesffuly perform the required effort.   <br>      <br>      <br>   3.  Factor 3 - Price   <br>      <br>   Price will be evaluated separately from past performance and other non-price factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.  The total evaluated price will be evaluated for reasonableness in terms of:   <br>      <br>   3.1.  Consistency with the requirement's acceptable technical capabilities in the vendor's technical quote;    <br>      <br>   3.2.  Price quote evaluation is to determine whether vendor's price quote is fair and reasonable, the Government will evaluate the completeness and reasonableness of vendor's price quote.  The Procuring Contracting Officer may conduct a cost analysis to support the price determination using Contract Pricing Reference Guide (https://acc.dau.mil/cprg).   <br>      <br>   3.3.  Option Items.  The Government will evaluate quotes for Purchase Orders award purposes by adding the total price for option item to the total price of the basic requirement for each  product type.   The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the quote for option prices is significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.    <br>      <br>   (end of provision)   <br>      <br>   52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2012)   <br>   52.247-29 	F.O.B.

Award of Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Orders shall be made on a competitive basis, using the  quote mark best-value Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote mark  process.  The Government intends to award a minimum of two (2)  and a maximum of six (6) Purchase Orders depending upon the availability of funds.    <br>        <br>    2.  The LPTA process does not permit tradeoffs between price and non-price factors in accordance with FAR Part 15; thus, the Government will award to responsible vendors who meet or exceed the acceptability standards for non-price factors with the lowest evaluated price.  The evaluation factors are listed below.    <br>        <br>    Factor 1 - Technical Capability    <br>    Factor 2 - Past Performance    <br>    Factor 3 - Price    <br>        <br>    3.  The Government evaluators will not assume that the vendor's quote possesses any capability or knowledge unless it is specified in the quote.      <br>        <br>    4.  The Government intends to evaluate and award Purchase Orders without discussions.  However, the Government reserves the  right to conduct discussions.  If discussion are required, they will be conducted with vendors in the competitive range to the extent deemed necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer IAW FAR 15.306.    <br>        <br>    5.  If any of the above non-price factors receives an individual rating of  quote mark Unacceptable, quote mark  the vendor's quote will deemed  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  and removed from further consideration.  Only quotes receiving an overall rating of  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  will be considered for award.    <br>        <br>    (b) EVALUATION CRITERIA    <br>        <br>    1.  Factor 1 - Technical Capability    <br>        <br>    The vendor's quote will be evaluated to the degree to which the vendor's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide litters with the requested technicalcapabilities,specifications, salient characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum essential characteristics.  The degree to which the Offeror's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide delivery and training as stated in the Statement of Need. The degree to which the training package demonstrates to the Government a clear understanding of each system must be met. The degree in which the systems parts list will be clear and complete so that the Government will have a full understanding of what makes up each system.  Table 1 identifies the ratings for Factor 1.    <br>        <br>    Table 1:  Factor 1 Ratings    <br>    Rating	           Description    <br>    Acceptable ---   Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.    <br>    Unacceptable --- Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.      <br>        <br>    2.  Factor 2 - Past Performance    <br>        <br>    a.  The past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the vendor's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in services that meets the requirements of the Statement of Need.  The Government will conduct a past performance risk evaluation that will be based on the quality, relevance, and currency of the Offeror's past performance on products and services of similar size, scope, and complexity within similar periods of performance as it related to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.   A purchase order or contract of similar nature is a contract of comparable risk - functions, responsibilities, and control exercised by the Contractor which is essentially the same as required under the Request for Quote solicitation.    <br>        <br>    b.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of demonstrating relevancy of the past performance and expectation based on the relevant past performance that the requirements will successfully be performed rests with the Offeror.  Other sources available to the Government include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).  The vendor must provide a list of 3 references of relevant past and present contracts for Federal, State and/or City agencies and commercial customers within the past 3 years.   quote mark Relevant quote mark  is defined as like items as stated in this solicitation's Statement of Work in terms of similar characteristics and quantities.  References must include:    <br>        <br>    Name of the Organization that will be providing the reference,     <br>    Name of the Point of Contact (POC),     <br>    POC Telephone Number,    <br>    POC Email address,     <br>    Contract Number,     <br>    Period of Performance, and    <br>    Description of goods/services rendered.     <br>        <br>    c.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the Offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.    <br>        <br>    Table 2:  Factor 2 Ratings    <br>    Rating	        Description    <br>    Acceptable ---  Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance record is unknown.    <br>    Unacceptable --- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to succesffuly perform the required effort.    <br>        <br>        <br>    3.  Factor 3 - Price    <br>        <br>    Price will be evaluated separately from past performance and other non-price factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.  The total evaluated price will be evaluated for reasonableness in terms of:    <br>        <br>    3.1.  Consistency with the requirement's acceptable technical capabilities in the vendor's technical quote;     <br>        <br>    3.2.  Price quote evaluation is to determine whether vendor's price quote is fair and reasonable, the Government will evaluate the completeness and reasonableness of vendor's price quote.  The Procuring Contracting Officer may conduct a cost analysis to support the price determination using Contract Pricing Reference Guide (https://acc.dau.mil/cprg).    <br>        <br>    3.3.  Option Items.  The Government will evaluate quotes for Purchase Orders award purposes by adding the total price for option item to the total price of the basic requirement for each  product type.   The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the quote for option prices is significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.     <br>        <br>    (end of provision)    <br>        <br>    52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2012)    <br>    52.247-29 	F.O.B.

Award of Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Orders shall be made on a competitive basis, using the  quote mark best-value Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote mark  process.  The Government intends to award a minimum of two (2)  and a maximum of six (6) Purchase Orders depending upon the availability of funds.     <br>          <br>     2.  The LPTA process does not permit tradeoffs between price and non-price factors in accordance with FAR Part 15; thus, the Government will award to responsible vendors who meet or exceed the acceptability standards for non-price factors with the lowest evaluated price.  The evaluation factors are listed below.     <br>          <br>     Factor 1 - Technical Capability     <br>     Factor 2 - Past Performance     <br>     Factor 3 - Price     <br>          <br>     3.  The Government evaluators will not assume that the vendor's quote possesses any capability or knowledge unless it is specified in the quote.       <br>          <br>     4.  The Government intends to evaluate and award Purchase Orders without discussions.  However, the Government reserves the  right to conduct discussions.  If discussion are required, they will be conducted with vendors in the competitive range to the extent deemed necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer IAW FAR 15.306.     <br>          <br>     5.  If any of the above non-price factors receives an individual rating of  quote mark Unacceptable, quote mark  the vendor's quote will deemed  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  and removed from further consideration.  Only quotes receiving an overall rating of  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  will be considered for award.     <br>          <br>     (b) EVALUATION CRITERIA     <br>          <br>     1.  Factor 1 - Technical Capability     <br>          <br>     The vendor's quote will be evaluated to the degree to which the vendor's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide litters with the requested technicalcapabilities,specifications, salient characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum essential characteristics.  The degree to which the Offeror's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide delivery and training as stated in the Statement of Need. The degree to which the training package demonstrates to the Government a clear understanding of each system must be met. The degree in which the systems parts list will be clear and complete so that the Government will have a full understanding of what makes up each system.  Table 1 identifies the ratings for Factor 1.     <br>          <br>     Table 1:  Factor 1 Ratings     <br>     Rating	           Description     <br>     Acceptable ---   Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.     <br>     Unacceptable --- Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.       <br>          <br>     2.  Factor 2 - Past Performance     <br>          <br>     a.  The past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the vendor's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in services that meets the requirements of the Statement of Need.  The Government will conduct a past performance risk evaluation that will be based on the quality, relevance, and currency of the Offeror's past performance on products and services of similar size, scope, and complexity within similar periods of performance as it related to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.   A purchase order or contract of similar nature is a contract of comparable risk - functions, responsibilities, and control exercised by the Contractor which is essentially the same as required under the Request for Quote solicitation.     <br>          <br>     b.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of demonstrating relevancy of the past performance and expectation based on the relevant past performance that the requirements will successfully be performed rests with the Offeror.  Other sources available to the Government include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).

Award of Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Orders shall be made on a competitive basis, using the  quote mark best-value Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote mark  process.  The Government intends to award a minimum of two (2)  and a maximum of six (6) Purchase Orders depending upon the availability of funds.      <br>            <br>      2.  The LPTA process does not permit tradeoffs between price and non-price factors in accordance with FAR Part 15; thus, the Government will award to responsible vendors who meet or exceed the acceptability standards for non-price factors with the lowest evaluated price.  The evaluation factors are listed below.      <br>            <br>      Factor 1 - Technical Capability      <br>      Factor 2 - Past Performance      <br>      Factor 3 - Price      <br>            <br>      3.  The Government evaluators will not assume that the vendor's quote possesses any capability or knowledge unless it is specified in the quote.        <br>            <br>      4.  The Government intends to evaluate and award Purchase Orders without discussions.  However, the Government reserves the  right to conduct discussions.  If discussion are required, they will be conducted with vendors in the competitive range to the extent deemed necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer IAW FAR 15.306.      <br>            <br>      5.  If any of the above non-price factors receives an individual rating of  quote mark Unacceptable, quote mark  the vendor's quote will deemed  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  and removed from further consideration.  Only quotes receiving an overall rating of  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  will be considered for award.      <br>            <br>      (b) EVALUATION CRITERIA      <br>            <br>      1.  Factor 1 - Technical Capability      <br>            <br>      The vendor's quote will be evaluated to the degree to which the vendor's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide litters with the requested technicalcapabilities,specifications, salient characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum essential characteristics.  The degree to which the Offeror's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide delivery and training as stated in the Statement of Need. The degree to which the training package demonstrates to the Government a clear understanding of each system must be met. The degree in which the systems parts list will be clear and complete so that the Government will have a full understanding of what makes up each system.  Table 1 identifies the ratings for Factor 1.      <br>            <br>      Table 1:  Factor 1 Ratings      <br>      Rating	           Description      <br>      Acceptable ---   Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.      <br>      Unacceptable --- Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.        <br>            <br>      2.  Factor 2 - Past Performance      <br>            <br>      a.  The past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the vendor's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in services that meets the requirements of the Statement of Need.  The Government will conduct a past performance risk evaluation that will be based on the quality, relevance, and currency of the Offeror's past performance on products and services of similar size, scope, and complexity within similar periods of performance as it related to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.   A purchase order or contract of similar nature is a contract of comparable risk - functions, responsibilities, and control exercised by the Contractor which is essentially the same as required under the Request for Quote solicitation.      <br>            <br>      b.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of demonstrating relevancy of the past performance and expectation based on the relevant past performance that the requirements will successfully be performed rests with the Offeror.  Other sources available to the Government include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).  The vendor must provide a list of 3 references of relevant past and present contracts for Federal, State and/or City agencies and commercial customers within the past 3 years.   quote mark Relevant quote mark  is defined as like items as stated in this solicitation's Statement of Work in terms of similar characteristics and quantities.  References must include:      <br>            <br>      Name of the Organization that will be providing the reference,       <br>      Name of the Point of Contact (POC),       <br>      POC Telephone Number,      <br>      POC Email address,       <br>      Contract Number,       <br>      Period of Performance, and      <br>      Description of goods/services rendered.       <br>            <br>      c.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the Offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.      <br>            <br>      Table 2:  Factor 2 Ratings      <br>      Rating	        Description      <br>      Acceptable ---  Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance record is unknown.      <br>      Unacceptable --- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to succesffuly perform the required effort.      <br>            <br>            <br>      3.  Factor 3 - Price      <br>            <br>      Price will be evaluated separately from past performance and other non-price factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.  The total evaluated price will be evaluated for reasonableness in terms of:      <br>            <br>      3.1.  Consistency with the requirement's acceptable technical capabilities in the vendor's technical quote;       <br>            <br>      3.2.  Price quote evaluation is to determine whether vendor's price quote is fair and reasonable, the Government will evaluate the completeness and reasonableness of vendor's price quote.  The Procuring Contracting Officer may conduct a cost analysis to support the price determination using Contract Pricing Reference Guide (https://acc.dau.mil/cprg).      <br>            <br>      3.3.  Option Items.  The Government will evaluate quotes for Purchase Orders award purposes by adding the total price for option item to the total price of the basic requirement for each  product type.   The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the quote for option prices is significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.       <br>            <br>      (end of provision)      <br>            <br>      52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2012)      <br>      52.247-29 	F.O.B.

The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.      <br>            <br>      (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.      <br>            <br>      (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed  12  months.      <br>      (End of clause)      <br>            <br>      252.211-7003   ITEM IDENTIFICATION AND VALUATION (JUN 2011)      <br>      252.232-7006 	Wide Area WorkFlow Payment Instructions 	JUN 2012       <br>            <br>      CONTRACTOR IDENTIFICATION (DEC 2005) (USAMRAA)       <br>            <br>      	When contractor personnel perform the services required in this contract on a Government installation they are required to possess and wear an identification badge that displays his or her name and the name of the Company.

<DESC><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">1. Purpose:<br /><br /></strong>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Aegis Ashore (AA) Program is conducting market research to determine interest, cost, and capability to manufacture Array Frame and Weldment Assemblies to be fabricated at a contractor location and shipped to a location to be determined within the continental United States at a later date. This market research will provide information to: 1) identify potential sources and their experience base to fulfill the requirements; 2) support the development of acquisition requirements, strategies, and cost estimates; 3) identify barriers to competition to reduce competition risk; 4) determine the need for documentation necessary to support proposal preparation; and 5) provide information on the capabilities of small business to fulfill the requirements in order to assess the feasibility of a total Small Business set-aside. The contemplated contract type is Firm Fixed Price (FFP). The resultant knowledge aids MDA in determining the best acquisition strategy to fulfill this requirement.<br /><br />This is a market research announcement for informational planning purposes only and does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), nor shall it be construed as a commitment by MDA. Information submitted will be considered an exchange of capabilities. Any proprietary information provided should be properly marked and MDA will control it as such. MDA is not accepting any classified information. No solicitation will be issued at this time. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by MDA. MDA is not bound by this information if a solicitation is issued. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by responders to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. The information provided herein is subject to change and does not bind the Government to solicit for or award a contract.<br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><br />2. Background:</strong> <br /><br />The AA Program was established on September 17, 2009 in response to the direction of the President of the United States. As part of the President's Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), AA builds upon already deployed U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) assets and adapts a sea-based weapon system for use on land. This will be accomplished by adapting the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) and Vertical Launching System (VLS) to the land based concept. The AA Missile Defense System (AAMDS) provides the capability to detect, track, intercept, and destroy missiles.<br /><br />The AA Program Office is developing an acquisition strategy to deploy the AAMDS at a designated Poland Site in Calendar Year 2018. The Array Frame and Weldment fabrication efforts required under this acquisition have been considered in relation to the requirements and milestones of the AA Program to establish realistic deadlines and deliverables, while balancing the AA funding profiles. The AA program's evaluation of the Array Frame acquisition strategy alternatives will be accomplished in multiple stages, with this first Request for Information (RFI) Sources Sought provided as an invitation for interested parties to provide input and information on their capabilities.<br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><br />3. Description:<br /></strong><br />The purpose of this RFI / Sources Sought is to aid MDA in determining if there is sufficient industrial expertise and interest to manufacture, build to print, Array Frames, Weldment Assemblies, and other needed hardware items (as listed in Table 1 attached) to support the Aegis Ashore platform in Poland. The fabricated items are to be completed at a contractor location and shipped to a location to be determined within the continental United States at a later date. <br /><br />At a minimum, the contractor shall have the capability to fabricate final end items up to a size of 10" x 10" Tubular Frame Structure / 16' x 20' Steel surface area / 2" Steel plate construction. The Government will not supply any special tooling or equipment for this requirement. <span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">Access to the drawing package will be provided to eligible contractors upon request and submission of required documentation, discussed under section 4 of this RFI.</span>

<DESC>The Navy has a requirement to monitor and record radiation exposures for whole and extremities at its various radiation producing facilities. Various end users include, but are not limited to, the Radiological Affairs Support Office (RASO), Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPP) and the Navy Hospitals and Medical Centers (NHMC). The DXTRAD Finger Ring is used to monitor for extremity dose. A DXTRAD Finger Ring Reader is needed to obtain the dose captured on the finger ring. The Navy currently utilizes the Harshaw 6600 finger ring reader. This model, while still useful, is not conducive to smaller work environments. A new reader is needed to reduce the overall footprint of the DXTRAD Finger Ring Reader.<br /><br />This announcement is being modified to change the point of contact from Megan Thayer to Megan Ault.&nbsp; Point of contact information is below.

ICAP does need to integrate with a netwrok AV, DLP appliance.<br /><br />There is a requirement for the proxy to simultaneously send log files to multiple locations/decices.

<p>This DRAFT RFP HHM402-14-R-0002 is published in accordance with FAR 15.202. The proposed contract type is Multiple Award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) for various professional IT services with TS/SCI cleared personnel. This notice constitutes a DRAFT solicitation, identified as HHM402-14-R-0002. Comments and questions are being requested at this time. A final RFP is scheduled to be posted in January 2014. The North American Industry Classification Code is 541519. It is the responsibility of the prospective contractors to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.</p>

The government anticipates multiple contract awards to both large and small business concerns. The ordering period of the multiple awards is anticipated to be for a base and four option years. The overall E-SITE Program ceiling is anticipated to be $6.0B.</p>
<p><br />The purpose of the E-SITE contract is to satisfy the information technology (IT) requirements for the Department of Defense (DoD) Intelligence Community, and would allow for external ordering of IT by other other Intelligence Community Partners.

Small business goals will also be reportable on an annual basis to ensure goals are being met. Past Performance will reflect the primes' capability to meet goals and provide real opportunities for their small business partners. Small business prime awards are envisioned as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR Parts 15 and 16.5, VACA anticipates the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to support the E-SITE requirement. The Government intends to make multiple awards resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offers, conforming to the solicitation, will be the best value to the Government.</p>
<p><strong><br /><br />The E-SITE Industry Day is re-scheduled for 30 October 2013. Details regarding the re-scheduled E-SITE Industry Day and registration process will be posted&nbsp;to <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>.&nbsp; Please hold all questions and registration request until the updated information is posted.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

Sole Source Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition 
(Simplified Acquisition Procedures $2,500 TO $150,000)

Subject:  OLYMPUS FLEXIBLE ENDOSCOPE MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR SERVICES
Olympus Laparoscope, Model WA50052A (EndoEYE HD II) ,Serial Number 616262
		 	
1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity and specific identification of document as a sole source justification for other than full and open competition:

	DEPARTMENT of VETERANS AFFAIRS
	Office of Acquisition and Logistics (OAL)
	National Acquisition Center (NAC)/Business Resource Service Center (BRS) 
	1st Avenue, One Block North of 22nd (Cermak) Street  
	Building #37
	Hines, Illinois 60141-0076

This document constitutes a sole source "Justification and Approval" for purchases of services, 
IAW 6.302-1, on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Service Distribution Center
(SDC), Service and Repair (S&R) Department, Building 37, Hines, Illinois (IL), 60141.

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:

The VA National Acquisition Center, Business Resource Services, Contingency Contracting Department, Hines, IL 60141 proposes by means of other than full and open competition, a need to acquire services and repairs of an Olympus Laparoscope-model, WA50052A (EndoEYE HD II)  to be performed by original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Olympus America, Inc.; to include, factory original repair parts, labor and shipping.
	
3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:

This acquisition derives from the fundamental nature, mission and objectives of the program office (VA, Hines SDC, S&R Department), who provides a service to VA Hospitals around the country, and some DOD facilities, state side and abroad. The  VA Hines SDC, S&R Department provides non warranty services and repairs for various medical equipment, including but not limited to flexible endoscopes.  Laparoscopes are known as critical diagnostic and surgical instruments utilized in various medical procedures and are valuable tools in providing direct patient care.  Relevant to the above stated equipment, for those services and/or repairs that cannot be accomplished in house by VA personnel and Non-OEM; they are outsourced to Olympus America, Inc.  

On August 6, 2013 the VA  Hines SDC, S&R Department received an Olympus' Laparoscopes model, 
WA50052A, Serial Number 616262 for complaint of no image.  Equipment was received from the VAMC Iowa 
City, Iowa . The VA Hines SDC, S&R Department conducted an initial evaluation of the subject equipment and 
determined that it could not be repaired in house and repairs would require outsourcing.
4.	An identification of the sole source rationale and statutory authority permitting a sole source acquisition:

This is a specific service provider requirement under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as stated in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  

Rationale:  Olympus America, Inc. has patent rights and proprietary ownership of their products, parts, services and does not authorize a third party service dealer or retailer to service and/or resale their equipment or parts.  As a result, the VA Hines SDC, S &R Department has a Bona Fide need to acquire on a sole source basis, services and repairs of  a Government owned Laparoscopes, from Olympus America, Inc. 

5.	A determination by the contracting officer (CO) that the anticipated cost will remain fair and reasonable:

Prices were verified to be consistent with Contractor's commercial price list for services and 
repairs of the WA50052A (EndoEYE HD II) Laparoscopes.

6.	A description of the market research conducted and the results of the research, or a statement why market research was not conducted:  

Market research was conducted and it was determine due to the unique nature of subject Laparoscopes
repairs and proprietary elements of the services and repairs; Olympus America, Inc. is the only viable option to
provide the required services and repairs to ensure strict adherence to manufacturer's specifications.  

7.	Any other facts supporting the sole source justification: 

Other sources, although capable of services and repairs, cannot obtain OEM manufacturer's parts and diagnostic equipment necessary to restore equipment to 100% functionality and to ensure adherence to manufacturer's specifications. In addition, Olympus' parts and repair service are proprietary to Olympus America, Inc. and are not releasable to the general public for equipment repairs. Again, to the best of our knowledge, no other service provider is authorized by Olympus America, Inc. at this time, to perform stated repairs for Olympus Laparoscopes model, WA50052A.

In reviewing this requirement, and discussing the details surrounding the equipment, it's rational to conclude that it would do more harm than good, to the patients of the VA Medical System and the Government, not to establish a sole source acquisition at this time.

8.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency will take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for supplies and services are made:

Contracting activity will continue to advocate brand name or equivalent specification for equipment purchased by VA Medical Centers. The NAC, BRS Department will continue to monitor and seek to identify other vendors that may meet the VA's specialized needs.

9.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: 

None at this time.



10.	Certification: 	I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
