<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Energy Information Administration (EIA) intends to award a modification in the amount of $30,000.00 to Contract DE-AC01-07EI38172 which was awarded to Dr. George M. Lady (Optima Consulting Services) of Hainesport, New Jersey for expanded services under Contract DE-AC01-07EI38172.  The period of performance of Contract DE-AC01-07EI38172 is currently from May 1, 2007 through January 31, 2008.  Such expanded services will involve estimating crude oil elasticities for the EIA.  Contract DE-AC01-07EI38172 was awarded on April 30, 2007 in the amount of $125,000.00 for the purpose of providing evaluation methodology support regarding portions of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) and the Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO) and related assistance to the EIA. In addition, this modification will change the period of performance of Option Period Two of Contract DE-AC01-07EI38172 FROM February 1, 2009 through April 30, 2009 TO February 1, 2009 through July 31, 2009, a period of 6 months.  The value of these expanded services will increase the total amount of Contract DE-AC01-07EI38172 by $30,000.00, from $125,000.00 to $155,000.00. Dr. Lady has provided extensive software customization support to the EIA for many years with regards to the NEMS and the STEO.  Dr. Lady has also, and is currently using his own proprietary software applications in analysis assistance to the EIA.  No other source exists which possesses both Dr. Ladyâs knowledge of these systems, their content and an equivalent to the highly specialized software to which he has proprietary rights. The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation is available for this requirement.  Interested parties may submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement within 15 calendar days of the publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has a requirement to establish, maintain, and operate a program for timely response to reports of marine mammals (both alive and dead) entangled in active and derelict commercial fishing gear.  This requirement includes the responsibility to conduct training to aid in the empowerment and enhancement of the skillset of network members in order to enable them to conduct their own responses, whenever possible, as well as public dissemination of information, approved by NMFS, gained from the response efforts.   The goals of NMFS are to maintain a team of experts to respond to marine mammal entanglements, prevent entanglements from becoming fatal, and to increase the pool of individuals qualified to assist the primary team or, eventually,  to assume full capability and responsibility of the response efforts.  The accomplishment of these goals requires a sound reporting and monitoring protocol as well as the necessary equipment needed for an emergency response team to maximize the potential for decreased timing responses to each incident.  The proposed contract is necessary to maintain a formal disentanglement network as a part of a greater management scheme that involves the U.S. Coast Guard, NMFS east coast regions, several state fisheries agencies, individual fishermen, and conservation and research groups.  The disentanglement program will require dedicated staff along with the infrastructure and administrative resources to support them.  The necessary support shall include office staffing, communications, public/media relations, education and outreach, provision and maintenance of equipment kits and caches, and training of network participants, including small boat safety and handling as required by NOAA small boat program.  The disentanglement network established by NMFS through it's current contractor includes providing assistance in Canadian territorial waters, as requested by NMFS, to the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans for entanglement response.  This proposed contract shall require that these contacts along the Atlantic coast of the United States be maintained.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541620.  The small business size standard is $6.5M. To be eligible for award, offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov and obtain a DUNS number by calling 1-800-333-0505.  Proof of CCR registration must be included in submitted proposal package.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. A copy of the solicitation will be attached to this announcement as a downloadable Word file on or about July 9, 2007.  A hard copy of the solicitation will only be provided in response to a written or faxed request received directly from the requestor.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Requests for hard copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Offers received by August 6, 2007 will be considered for award.  Award will be made on or about August 28, 2007.

<DESC>A competitive acquisition is anticipated to be held for Mode S Elementary and Enhanced Surveillance Testing Capability in the areas of design, implementation, installation, test and evaluation. This will include ongoing technical support from the contractor during the five-year duration of the proposed contract.  The identified Mode S is a stand-alone system. Further detail is provided in the Draft Statement of Work (SOW) and Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs) which have been uploaded as part of this Mode S Test and Evaluation Center (MSTEC) notice. This MSTEC posting is similar to a posting made this date under the ACTFAST identifier; however, the latter identifier is not appropriate for the acquisition of this 
stand-alone Mode S system. This FedBizOpps posting stands up the MSTEC acquisition. The next posting under MSTEC will be the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) in Aug 2007. Offerors will have thirty (30) calendar days to provide complete proposals.  It is anticipated it will be a best value source selection.  Further, that all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, will be significantly more important than price.  However, price will contribute substantially to the award decision.  The Government anticipates a ceiling price of no more than $5M under the Mode S acquisition with award of contract in Nov 2007.  The draft SOW and CDRLs that are specific to the Mode S requirements are part of this posting.  Industry is encouraged to provide comments on the attached draft SOW and CDRLs.  Responses to the SOW and CDRLs will be addressed to joanne.eldredge@edwards.af.mil and are due no later than 4:00 PM (local time) on 06 Aug 2007.  Firms can respond under either this MSTEC posting or the ACTFAST posting (both postings made this date); however, note should be made that all future Mode S postings will be made only under MSTEC and Solicitation No. FA9302-07-R-0005.

Four (4) copies of the Standard Form 330 and other pertinent information must be received no later than 3:00 PM Central Standard Time on September 25, 2007.  

The North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541310, Architectural Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8712.
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes to award one indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for supplemental architectural and engineering services for the State of Texas, Zone 1 (West Texas).  Texas Zone 1 currently consists of, but is not limited to, the area bordered by following counties:  Lipscomb, Hemphill, Wheeler, Collingsworth, Childress, Hall, Briscoe, Floyd, Crosby, Garza, Borden, Howard, Glasscock, Reagan, Upton, Crane, Pecos, Terrell, Brewster, Presidio, Jeff Davis, Hudspeth, El Paso, Culberson, Reeves, Loving, Winkler, Andrews, Gaines, Yoakum, Cochran, Bailey, Parmer, Deaf Smith, Oldham, Hartley, Dallam, Sherman, Hansford and Ochiltree.

There is no limit on the number of Task Orders, certified invoices, or the size of a project.  However, the total cumulative Task Orders, certified invoices, and oral purchases amount shall not exceed $3 million for any one-year contract period.  Projects, while there will be no limit on size, will generally involve repairs, alterations, and improvements in connection with existing construction cost.  A/E firms will be evaluated in terms of their professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services, specialized experience and technical competence in the fields of energy conservation, pollution prevention waste reduction, the use of recovered materials and services regarding asbestos related work.

Selection criteria for this acquisition are listed below in descending order of importance:  (1) Experience:  Experience of the firm and consultants with regard to providing the types of services described above, and with regard to accomplishment of past projects including repair and alteration work.

The Government will not indemnify the firm against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials, that is, no clause holding the firm harmless will be included in the contract.  A Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating FFP task orders.  A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing task orders for projects with an estimated construction cost of less than $2,000,000 will be included in the contract.  The Government will use the fixed price amount in the lookup table which will be a function of project size, type, and complexity.  The lookup table will be provided to the A/E during initial contract negotiations.

<DESC>Seeks expert research services designed to inform IAN of the transforming technology(ies) that may most affect sectors of the economy -- for better or worse -- and the governments actions that may most facilitate or obstruct the technological advances.  The International Trade Administration's (ITA) mission is to create prosperity by strengthening the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promoting trade and investment, and ensuring fair trade and compliance with trade laws and agreements.  ITA's Office of Industry Analysis (IAN) uses various analytical techniques and in-depth industry knowledge to identify and assess key factors, trends and policies that impact U.S. firms.  These assessments are used to help both policy makers and industry leaders better understand global market forces and how to respond to these forces.

The objective is to develop a set of well-defined yet distinct scenarios describing various potential futures of U.S. manufacturing identifying significant technological advances and key government policies, laws or regulations.  These scenarios will provide IAN a framework to identify key milestones and policy solutions that may predicate certain future outcomes as well as unintended consequences.  A potential future may include:  

*	Nanotechnology becomes as common place in consumer goods as computers are today.
*	Nanotechnology becomes central to technological improvements in medical devices.
*	Nanotechnological processes become crucial for the development of new chemicals, including pharmaceuticals.
*	The government actions (e.g. policies, laws, regulations) that are most like to obstruct (facilitate) the adoption the transforming nanotechnology
*	The sectors of the economy that would benefit most (or be hurt by) the transforming nanotechnology and the government action.
 

Seeks expert services that will efficiently and effectively provide future scenarios in support of MAS mission of providing expert research and analysis in order to shape and implement trade policy, create conditions that encourage innovation, lower the cost of doing business, and promote U.S. economic growth.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole source Request for Proposal (RFP) to Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation (BATC) for the fabrication of the second Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) Instrument.   BATC will manufacture, test and deliver the second GMI flight instrument, support instrument integration on the spacecraft, and provide launch and post-launch support. The GMI contract was awarded through full and open competition to BATC on March 22, 2005, to develop the GMI Instrument flight unit #1 for the Core spacecraft.   In order to achieve full potential of the GPM mission it is paramount that the two instruments on Core and Constellation spacecraft be identical in performance.  Since BATC is currently under contract to develop the first GMI flight unit for the Core spacecraft, they are uniquely qualified to produce the second instrument for Constellation spacecraft. The Government will incur cost savings with this sole source procurement as the nonrecurring design and development cost associated with the production of the second instrument is avoided and all lessons learned will be applied during the assembly and test. In addition to the cost savings described above, this sole source will enable NASA to avoid unacceptable schedule delays to fulfilling mission requirements.	Complex instruments such as GMI, normally have a 48-month developmental schedule and since the second flight instrument is needed in early 2012, BATC has the unique knowledge and understanding of the GMI instrument to provide the instrument in time to support the launch.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)-Only One Responsible Source. However, organizations that believe they can provide the instrument without any detrimental impact to the program schedules, may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. EST on September 5, 2007.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>In accordance with the guidance promulgated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (NII), concerning Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR), which deals with the mitigation of denial of Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), this effort is concerned with the first two of the three elements:  Electronic Protection (EP) and Electronic Support (ES). Please note, this effort does not address Electronic Attack (EA). 
  
Precision navigation and timekeeping are essential for many modern naval and maritime systems, and it is essential that navigation and timekeeping services be made available to platforms and weapons at the highest level of accuracy and with the highest possible confidence at reasonable cost.  Lack of precise navigation and timekeeping technologies may jeopardize the success of military operations.  For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate position/time information at low cost and, due to this, GPS has become the technology of choice for many users.  Unfortunately, the GPS signal is a low-power signal that is susceptible to interference. Therefore there is a need for (1) affordable approaches to make GPS more reliable/robust, and (2) methods of quantifying threats to GPS performance that may be termed ?situational awareness? and (3) affordable and reliable precision navigation/timing alternatives to GPS.   
  
In the past six years, ONR has been conducting a series of Navigation and Timekeeping Science and Technology Projects in the following three technology areas; GPS Anti-Jam Technology,  Precision Time and Time Transfer Technology, and Non-GPS Navigation Technology.  

In FY2009, the ONR Navigation and Timekeeping Technology Program seeks new and innovative navigation technologies that will provide more accurate, reliable, maintainable and affordable systems for Naval air, surface, subsurface and ground platforms and forces.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 811219   The US EPA/OCEFT National Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a limited source purchase order to Thermo Electron North America LLC for a service agreement for the X7 ICP-MS Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer, the Cetac ASX-520 Autosampler, the Recircultor Chiller M75 50/60HZ, and the UP 266 Beam Focusing Laser.  It includes maintenance, repair, and calibration for the laboratory devices and related accessories.  The agreement is an annual renewal  and will be in place from October 3, 2007 to October 2, 2008.   The justification for a limited source purchase is as follows.  The X7 ICP Mass Spectrometer and New Wave UP Laser hardware, software, and associated accessories are a Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer  (LA-ICP-MS) system developed by NEIC to determine relative elemental abundances in soil samples, filter particulates, and process materials, allowing NEIC to perform ICP-MS analysis of individual particles rather than bulk samples, which increases their forensic capabilities.  The nature of the  system requires NEIC to not only insure that the highly specialized equipment and accessories are operating at peak performance at all times, but that the potentially dangerous equipment is in safe working order, maintained only by specially trained individuals.  Thermo Electron North America LLC  is the only organization with the combination of hardware knowledge, software knowledge, and available parts that is capable of properly servicing the X7-ICP-MS and the New Wave UP 266 Laser hardware, software, and associated accessories.  Furthermore, no other organization offers an Essential  Support Plan for the X7 ICP-MS and the NW UP 266 Laser.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be  considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the contracting officer at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

ESRB's goal is to  quantify the value of energy efficiency to homebuilders, homebuyers, and the environment by correlating real-world energy savings with the level of energy efficient construction. Accurate and confirmable cost-effective data for energy efficient residential construction will support the adoption of  voluntary energy efficient programs nationwide. It has been determined that Advanced Energy is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement as it is the only known organization to perform a utility study which isolates methods of energy efficient construction, and compares these data  with base levels. In addition, Advance Energy possesses leading experts in the fields of building science and energy efficient construction research and has performed a similar analysis for the Phoenix, AZ market. NO SOLICIATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Matthew Growney, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2029
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   Under authority granted in FAR 13.501, the US Environmental Protection Agency's National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) intends to seek a quotation on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS from Nikon Instruments, Inc. for a spectral confocal imaging multi-user core system for fixed and live cells.   The NHEERL's main campus imaging core facility requires a confocal imaging system with capabilities for rapid, high sensitivity, high resolution spectral imaging of fluorescence in live cells and fixed tissues.  These capabilities are essential  for NHEERL's investigations of molecular and biochemical changes induced by environmental stimuli in living cells and fixed tissues samples.  Requirements for this system include the capacity for multiple spectral resolutions over a 300 nm acquisition range and a spectral acquisition time of 2  seconds per 512 x 512 32-channel frame, essential to producing images of optimal clarity to capture short-lived intracellular events associated with the effects of environmental agents in living cells.  Additional requirements include compatibility with NIST traceable standards for compliance with  Agency quality control and assurance standards. Only the Nikon system has a separate fiber-optically-coupled detection unit, a design feature that allows for the sensitivity necessary to meet the above requirements.  In addition, investigators at NHEERL's main campus facility have collaborative  research with scientists from NHEERL's Human Studies Division who currently use a Nikon confocal system at their facility.  These ongoing collaborations require compatibility of NHEERL's main campus confocal imaging system with that of the Human Studies Division's confocal microscope. Only the  Nikon Instruments Spectral Confocal Imaging System Multi-User Core System for Fixed and Live Cells meets all of the above requirements.  Nikon Instruments, Inc is the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirement because it manufactures the only instrument that meets the  government's needs for this system. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received by September 5, 2006 in order to be considered by  the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a  competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to Matthew J. Growney by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail growney.matthew@epa.gov to receive consideration for this purchase order. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) order under BOA number N00019-05-G-0008 for services and engineering support necessary for the Tomahawk Block III and IV All-Up-Round (AUR) integration into the SSN-774 launch platform, specifically Block III Capsule Launch System (CLS) and Torpedo Tube Launch (TTL) plus Block IV CLS variants.  This effort includes technical support in the areas of systems engineering; mechanical engineering; electrical engineering;  performance engineering; safety; integrated logistics support (ILS); integration, verification, and test (IVT); software engineering; as well as program management.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Company, P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, Raytheon has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk AUR.  Raytheon solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk AUR missile.  Raytheon currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk missile is required to perform the services and engineering support necessary for the Tomahawk Block III and IV All-Up-Round (AUR) integration into the SSN-774 launch platform, Raytheon is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 USC 253 (c)(1), with Alcatel-Lucent of Murray Hill, NJ, for a Multi-Electrical Characterization System.   

The NIST/CNST has recently hired a scientist from Bell Labs, a part of Alcatel-Lucent.  As such, NIST has a unique opportunity to purchase a lot of used equipment from Alcatel-Lucent for the purpose of magneto-transport characterization of nanofabricated structures.

A comprehensive electrical characterization of nanodevices based on novel material combinations requires a toolset capable of electrical probing at intermediate processing stages with the sensitivity capable of electrical detection to single atom/dopant /electron motion within the devices and an acceptable throughput for accumulating a statistically significant dataset.  These requirements cannot be met by any single experimental tool. This lot of tools is designed to address different material, fabrication and measurement issues common for a broad range of devices. 

The lot consists of three major characterization/fabrication tools:
(1) A high-vacuum evaporator which is equipped with a custom-designed cold stage with tilt over 180 degrees relative to evaporation axis and 360 degree rotation;

(2) An Oxford Heliox 2 top-loading He3 cryostat enabling transport measurement in a quiet and controlled electronic environment over extended period of time; and

(3) A JOEL JSPM-4200 AFM/STM system which is used as a versatile structural characterization tool and as a nanoscale probe station.  

Other devices in the lot are used to support different types of electrical measurements (ultra-low voltage and current noise, high frequency etc.) within the main characterization stations.

This lot of equipment has been assembled over a few years and is not collection of individual components, but rather an entire system.  Each piece has been selected and, in many cases, customized to work with all the others.  The customized items are unique and are, therefore, not available from any other source. 

Sole source determination is based on the following:
The equipment lot is currently owned by Alcatel-Lucent/Bell Laboratories.  Alcatel-Lucent does not typically sell used equipment, however, in this case, they are discontinuing the project that the suite of equipment was purchased to perform, and they have offered this equipment to the scientist in order for the research to continue at NIST.  As this lot of equipment is only available from Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent is the only source for this equipment.

In addition, there is a real and substantial benefit to the Government both in terms of cost and in terms of a dramatic reduction in the time necessary to establish an operational multi-electrical characterization lab in the CNST. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by September 4, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Specifically, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) assays will be used to quantify circulating levels of amino acids, acylcarnitines, and fatty acid metabolites in previously-collected serum samples from 260 breast and endometrial cancer cases, 260 controls, and 52 women selected as quality control samples.  Duke University is the only vendor known to the HREB that is uniquely qualified to meet the requirements of this effort without the introduction of new variables into ongoing research.  Duke University has extensive experience in the metabolomic profiles of obese subjects and the profile changes induced by weight loss.  They are unique in that they are able to provide quantitatively rigorous data for clusters of analytes in each of the three analtye classes (amino acids, acylcarnitines, and fatty acids), as opposed to screening labs that simply search for appearance of aberrant analyte peaks.  Duke University has experts on matebolomics in subjects without inborn errors of metabolism and who have optimized the assays for "normal populations".  Duke University is uniquely able to perform the assays in a high throughput manner to complete the work.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.

<CONTACT>Theresta Lanier Contracting Officer 2023669684     theresta.lanier@dot.gov;
<DESC>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  This is NOT a solicitation and does not constitute a Government agreement to contract.  The Department of Transportation, Maritime administration is seeking a contractor to provide diver services to support the collection of biological samples from the hulls of the three (3) vessels per the Statement of Work (SOW) work: SOW The aim is to support Maritime Administration-supplied marine biologists conducting a survey of the biofouling community associated with the hull and underwater appendages of three (3) vessels at the Beaumont Reserve Fleet.  The surveys will contain two main components: 1) an image library of video and still images of the hull, propeller, rudder, stern tube and gratings; 2) samples of biota collected from the areas surveyed by camera.  Sea chests and internal piping will also be examined if possible (based of diver capabilities and conditions). Sea chest strainer plates and/or hull blanks covering the sea chests, if installed, shall not be removed.   The scientists must be given the ability to view/communicate from the dive boat but if this is not possible, then there must be a capability to communicate from a position aboard the ship (which means a long "tether" to the diver). For the hulls of vessels sampled in the past, samples were taken from transverse transects from bow to stern at three depths; waterline (just below), mid depth and flat bottom at approximately 30 foot intervals. Samples were also taken from the rudder, propeller, any recessed areas/sea chests, appurtenances, and any other areas of interest to the scientists.  It is anticipated that this will be the same method employed during this contract.  Approximately 50 samples will be taken per sampling event. 1.	The survey and sampling will be conducted at The Beaumont Reserve Fleet.  2.	Divers must have surface air, surface audio and visual communications, and will provide recordings (DVD and mini disks) of the survey.   3.	The use of a Clearwater box was essential during earlier sampling projects.  Divers should have this capability even though the visibility may not be bad. 4.	Divers will be directed by the scientific (surface) team and will take images and samples from different locations all around the hull and on the rudders, propellers, stern tubes, struts, gratings etc.   5.	Samples will be collected in scientist-supplied bags. The bags will be provided by the science team and will be pre-labeled.  Approximately 50 samples per sampling event will be collected.   6.	Divers shall provide still photographs of sample locations along the hull using a camera box with standardized field of view for each photo.  The photo of the hull must be taken adjacent to where a biological sample will be collected in order not to disturb the sample area. The sample is to be collected after the photo has been taken. For a scientifically robust sampling, a two-person dive team is recommended.  7.	Underwater video of the sample collection process should also be provided. 8.	Initial sorting of samples will be conducted by the science team on dock side. Deliverables.   a.	The offeror shall provide the following documentation to the Maritime Administration Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, (COTR) for the three vessel that undergo biological sampling in the BRF only.   1.	Four copies of the underwater video of the sample collection process shall also be provided.  Submittals shall be in digital format on CD-ROM or DVD as appropriate. The video shall be submitted to the Maritime Administration COTR within two weeks after completion of the sample collection process 2.	Still photographs taken of the sample locations during collection of the biological samples shall be provided.   Submittals shall be in digital format on CD-ROM as appropriate. The still photographs shall be submitted to the Maritime Administration COTR within two weeks after completion of the sample collection process All reports whether interim or final shall be signed versions and shall be digitally scanned onto a CD-ROM in either Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word document format.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.

<RESPDATE>082707
<ARCHDATE>10262007
<CONTACT>Leeann Burke, 254-287-5457
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue a purchase order to a Stanley Vidmar, 11 Grimes Road, Allentown, PA18105, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirement s.  Requirements call for custom cabinetry and storage solutions that can easily integrate with already existing Stanley-Vidmar cabinetry and storage solutions installed throughout the Combat Aviation Brigade footprint.  The requirement also calls for a pr oduct that has a world-wide replacement, a lifetime warranty, and contractor support.  The description of the product includes storage solutions and work stations that will enable aviation maintainers the ability to conduct maintenance within close proximi ty of the aircraft.  Under our current situation, tools, repair parts, maintenance manuals, and maintainer personal protective equipment are all stored in separate locations.  Time used to secure these items and re-store them for security and accountabilit y purposes creates inefficiencies.  The standard aviation maintenance bay incorporates storage locations for tools, repair parts, maintenance manuals, and maintainer personal protective equipment and a workspace for the maintainer to conduct automated writ e-ups in the aircraft automated logbooks.  Specific description of supplies includes: Storage systems and various work stations that enhance deployment readiness and work efficiency.  These storage systems allow for an expedient and organized deployment. P lus provide a uniform work environment to store equipment in an organized manner that provides ready access to our equipment at home station and deployed locations,  and more importantly will increase the units overall deployment readiness.  Given the curr ent status of cabinetry and storage solutions in the Combat Aviation Brigade there is a critical need for new storage solutions that can seamlessly integrate with existing Stanley-Vidmar cabinetry and storage solutions.  New storage solutions are vital to ensuring that aviation maintainers have viable means to ensure proper maintenance of the 4th Infantry Divisions rotary wing fleet of 110 helicopters.  Our current facilities are not in line with the standard set-up for an aviation maintenance bay.  For ex ample, there are no repair workstations in the newest hangars that hold our AH-64 Apaches; it is essentially an empty hangar.  In some cases elsewhere in the Combat Aviation Brigade footprint, where we dont have Stanley-Vidmar cabinetry and storage soluti ons, we are using plastic tables to store heavy and bulky aviation parts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars while Soldiers perform repairs.  This causes situations that are not only unsafe to our Soldiers, but it could also cost the Army money due to t he high probability of damage should one of these unstable tables collapse and damage the repair parts.  Using the existing Stanley-Vidmar products coupled with the new products we are requesting will create a situation that enables the Combat Aviation Bri gade to conduct phase maintenance and unscheduled maintenance using equipment that is safe and durable.  Without this purchase, there is an increased chance of unsafe maintenance practices as well as increased opportunities to damage critical aviation repa ir parts that could potentially lead to an aviation mishap or injury to Soldiers.  Required delivery schedule is no later than 1 October 2007.

<CONTACT>Ms. Tracy M. Carole 301-227-4893
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) and the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) are seeking information from potential sources that can provide commercially-viable technologies, systems, or processes for the recycling of shipboard plastic waste disks into feedstock for manufactured products or fuel in waste-to-energy conversions systems. The Plastics Waste Processor (PWP) is used by the fleet to compact shipboard plastic waste into dense sanitary disks that can be stored in odor barrier bags to prevent shipboard habitability problems. Navy ships retain the plastic waste disks onboard while at sea to comply with zero-plastic waste discharge regulations. When ships return to U.S. ports, these disks are offloaded and disposed of in landfills. Navy ships generate an estimated 1,500 tons per year of plastic waste. The goal of this initiative is to eliminate the landfill disposal of PWP plastic disks through recycling. The potential !  obstacle to recycling is that the plastic disks intermingle various plastic types with food and other contaminants (e.g., metal, glass, paper, cardboard, and cloth) by melting the thermoplastics around the other constituents. The proposed solution must demonstrate the ability to recycle the plastic waste disks into feedstock for manufactured products or fuel in waste-to-energy conversion systems at a cost equal to or lower than current landfill disposal fees ($40-$50 per ton). The proposed solution shall also identify who will remove the plastic disks offloaded from Navy ships. Potential offerors are requested to respond with technical documentation supporting the commercially-viable technology, system or process, including: (a) process description, (b) processing rate capability, (c) descriptions of demonstrations conducted to date, (d) current commercial, industrial, or military applications, (e) an estimate of the fee (per ton plastic waste) to process the PWP plastic di!  sks, (f) preliminary implementation plan (less than one page), that tr acks the Navy plastic disks from who removes the disks offloaded from Navy ships all the way to how the disks are used or consumed in the final application, and (g) quantity of systems sold or in use commercially. Technical, industry, or professional society certifications or endorsements should be provided, if available. The submittals should consist of no more than ten pages of text, including data and/or illustrations and are due by August 31, 2007. This synopsis is for information purposes and to identify potential technologies and offerors. This sources sought announcement does not constitute a request for proposal (RFP) and does not obligate the government in any way to purchase or test any of the potential solutions offered. Furthermore, it does not commit the government to pay for any proposal costs in response to the sources sought announcement. Submit responses for this synopsis to Ms. Tracy M. Carole by email (tracy.carole@navy.mil) or by mail to Naval Surface War!  fare Center, Attn: Tracy M. Carole, Code 634, 9500 MacArthur Blvd., West Bethesda, Maryland 20817-5700.

<CONTACT>Debra Zamarron, Code 210000D, (760) 939-9658.  E-mail: Debra.Zamarron@navy.mil.
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (amendment 0001) is to distribute the revised Section 1.4, Program Goals, provided in the attachment to the original synopsis (N6893607R0061). Also provided is the questions and answers which were discussed at Industry Day held at NAWCWD, China Lake on 15 August 2007, and the Industry Day Attendance Log. The following specifications have been designated as program goals and were defined in order to indicate the target characteristics and operating environments that are extremely important.  The overall goal is to develop a weapon 0/0 sensor that is capable of attacking the following target types in the environments listed. 1. Provide a sensor that can detect and track, and report (to the DASH core processor) moving, relocateable, and stationary targets in adverse weather conditions. Sample Target Descriptions:  ships, technicals (armed civilian vehicles), armor, air defense units, small boats, structures, and specific aim points on targets greater than 9 m2 (stationary or moving). Typical target radar cross sections for analysis can be: Ford Pickup: 10 dBsm; 7 meter boat: 15 dBsm; Armor: 13 dBsm; and a Frigate at 50 dBsm. For infrared analysis use an Effective Target Contrast of 2 C and an NE&#61508;T &#8804; 130 milliKelvin. 2. Demonstrate the ability to detect and track moving targets with a minimum discernable velocity of no more than 5 knots, with 1 knot desired, and a maximum velocity not less than 80 knots. 3. Demonstrate the ability to detect and track moving targets executing weaving maneuvers up to 0.3 g's. 4. Demonstrate the ability to detect and guide to stationary targets in adverse weather conditions. 5. Demonstrate the ability to detect and track the targets in a variety of weather and environmental conditions defined as: a. Clear Weather: 23 km visibility b. Haze/Smoke/Dust: 5 km visibility c. Rain < 5mm/hour  d. Fog < 0.5 km visibility e. High Humidity:  21 g/m3 f. 0/0 Conditions: Zero  meters visibility, zero meters ceiling g. Day and Night h. Military Operations in Urban Terrain Environment i. Desert Environment (China Lake range representative) j. Rural Environment k. Mountainous Environment l. Forest Environment m. Jungle Environment n. Ice and Snow Environment o. Maritime Environment (littorals included, NAWCWPNS Sea Range Pt. Mugu representative) i. Maximum Sea State of 6 (winds to 33 knots) 6. Demonstrate a detection range in excess of 6 nmi against a 10 dBsm target.  Available prime power is a function of the weapon and power source. Weapons with batteries can be assumed to have 100W available. Other weapons with generators can have up to 400 W available. If more power is required that will be a trade study at the weapon system level. 7. Demonstrate a sensor field of regard in excess of 50 degrees in elevation and azimuth (± 25° from boresight) 8. Demonstrate the sensor relative target location error supports a weapon system CEP of less than 3 meters. 9. Demonstrate the sensor has sufficient resolution to support Automatic Target Recognition algorithms and aim point selection on targets with a physical extent greater than 9 m2. Lock On After Launch (LOAL) requirement. 10. Demonstrate a sensor tracker than can maintain tracks on the five targets nearest the cue location until they fall out of the sensor field of regard. this tracking capability must be part of the sensor processor, not part of the DASH Core Processor. 11. Demonstrate the sensor in a 5" diameter form factor such as the DSU-33 volume. The goal is for the production DASH to fit entirely in the DSU-33 volume. For demonstration hardware, the "back end" components can exceed the DSU volume; however the aperture should remain in the DSU-33 form factor to simplify flight certification. 12. Demonstrate the sensor supports both lock on after launch (LOAL) and lock on before launch (LOBL) functionality for fire and forget operation. 13. Demonstrate off axis launch capability up to at least 25 degrees. A Zuni type application where the target is at least 25 degrees off the missile axis in primarily a lock on before launch application. 14. Demonstrate that the 0/0 sensor tracker can provide track update rates in excess of 5 Hz to the DASH core processor for the final ten seconds of flight. 15. Demonstrate that the sensor provides enough information to perform target identification or that the sensor design accommodates the inclusion of an imaging sensor into the DASH form factor. a. Target identification will include distinguishing combatant water and land craft from noncombatant water and land craft. b. Target identification includes distinguishing a machine gun equipped pick up truck from a noncombatant pick up truck. 16. Provide analysis that the 0/0 sensor can be produced affordably to support a DASH production cost of $15,000.00 per round for a 6,000 unit production rate for 5 years. The $10K portion for the 0/0 sensor is a rough estimate with the core processor and imaging sensor, if required, additional, but staying under the $15K total. 17. Demonstrate the sensor design does not require significant launcher and launch platform interface modifications. For the initial demonstration show the sensor test operation is compatible with existing aircraft and weapon interfaces. 18. Demonstrate the sensor subcomponent design is compatible with a variety of weapon airframes including Zuni, JDAM (DSU-33), JSOW, and Tomahawk. 19. Demonstrate the tracker output is compatible with the DASH core processor and sensor fusion algorithms, use of a STANAG or NATO format is desired. a. The DASH Core Processor design is to be determined b. The DASH Sensor Fusion algorithms are an out year development. c. Flexibility in message format and utilizing standard communication interfaces between subcomponents is desired. 20. Demonstrate the sensor is compatible with a captive carry environment on an F/A-18 C/D including flight elevations of 30,000 feet. 21. Demonstrate the ability of the sensor to detect and signal the core processor when the weapon is a specified distance from target impact.

<DESC>A/B MAC CYCLE 2 ? JURISDICTIONS 6, 11, 14 & 15

Section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take the necessary steps between now and 2011 to implement Medicare Contracting Reform (MCR).  MCR will bring standard contracting principles to Medicare such as competition and performance incentives.  These basic contracting principles, which have been applied to other federal programs under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), have been missing from the Medicare contracting environment.  CMS is required to replace the current contracting authority under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with the new Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority.  The MAC?s will perform the work currently being handled by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, regional home health intermediaries and durable medical equipment regional carriers in administering the Medicare fee-for-service program.  

CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for the Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractors (A/B MAC) for Jurisdiction 6 (comprised of the states of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin), Jurisdiction 11 (comprised of the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia), Jurisdiction 14 (comprised of the states of Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont) and Jurisdiction 15 (compromised of the states of Kentucky and Ohio).    

The A/B MAC will provide specified fee-for-service health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, for most all institutional health care as well as for providers.  It is anticipated that this solicitation will result in the award of four stand-alone A/B MAC contracts.  These contracts will include a base year and four one-year options.  CMS anticipates releasing the solicitation on or about August 30, 2007.

<DESC>X-Bot Solicitation Amendment 07 During the X-Bot technical demonstration, the government concluded that there was too much emphasis placed on the operators ability to identify the items in a low-light condition.  The emphasis should have been placed on system resolution in a low light e nvironment.  Paragraph 4.3. in the notes section in MIS-PRF-56596RevB (2) Exhibit (A) states that Effectiveness will be measured by 19 positive identifications out of 20 attempts by a 5th to 95th percentile representative Army Soldier.  Accordingly, the Government decided that it is necessary to re-conduct the technical demonstration.  As a result, items used in the initial demonstration will be replaced with common items to reduce the emphasis on the operators knowledge of military items.  The course la yout will be adjusted to ensure that there is no benefit from the first demonstration run.  The revised technical demonstration plan was posted to the PEO STRI website for your review and use.  The performance requirements will remain the same; however the  sequence has been changed slightly.    Bidders will be scheduled for timeslots in the same order during the 22rd - 24th of August 2007.  The technical demonstration will not change with the exception of the process for completing Station 6A, the low light item identification.  All other portio ns of the technical demonstration will be followed as written in the original technical demonstration plan.  Bidders will be notified via phone on 24 August 07 whether they passed or failed the technical demonstration.  A formal invitation to the Reverse Auction will be sent on 27 August 07 with instructions.      The following is the expected milestone schedule: Letter of intent							7 August 2007 Submission of 1494s 						7 August 2007 Issue Technical Demonstration timeslots			8 August 2007 Technical Demonstration 					13  15 August 2007 Submission of Reps and Certs				16 August 2007 Submission of Subcontracting Plan (if required)		16 August 2007 Issue Technical Demonstration re-run timeslots		17 August 2007 Technical Demonstration Re-Run				22 - 24 August 2007 Invitations to participate in the Reverse Auction		24 August 2007 Bidders submission of Reverse Auction Clause		24 August 2007 Issue Passwords to the Reverse Auction applicant		24 August 2007 Reverse Auction 						4 September 2007 Pre-Award Survey 						5 - 14 September 2007 Contract Award						14 September 2007 If you should have any questions regarding this information, refer them to the below listed points of contact for formal responses.

<DESC>The U.S. Air Force requests industry-wide assistance in identifying potential concepts/solutions for the Air Force?s full spectrum of military combat support capabilities.  The Agile Combat Support Modernization Analysis Working Group (MAWG) is interested in obtaining information from industry, academia, and National Laboratories for concepts/solutions, as well as enabling and critical R&D innovative technologies and approaches, which potentially enhance Air Force ability to achieve combat support across a full spectrum of military operations.  The MAWG is preparing to conduct a Functional Solutions Analysis (FSA) for FY-10 POM input.  Agile Combat Support is comprised of equipment and systems that are applied in support of all Air Force military operations.  There is an immediate need to safely and efficiently operate, survive, and sustain operations in all Combat Support scenarios with lighter weight, smaller footprint, reduced number of combat support resources to achieve a more rapidly deployable capability.  These mandates require the more efficient application of combat support resources, equipment, and concepts, via enabling technologies to support a broad spectrum of combat support capabilities.  Agile Combat Support concept of operations identifies 27 functional areas in support of Expeditionary Combat Support operations.  This RFI is limited to the following functional areas: Aeromedical Evacuation, Air Traffic Control and Airfield Management, Chaplain, Civil Engineer, Communications and Information, Contracting, Financial Management and Comptroller, Historian, Intelligence, Judge Advocate, Logistics Planning, Maintenance and Munitions, Manpower, Medical, Military Equal Opportunity, Personnel, Postal Services, Protocol, Public Affairs, Safety, Security Forces, Base Services, Supply, and Transportation.  To be considered a viable concept, submissions must apply to one or more Agile Combat Support capabilities.  A capability list of requested topics is provided in a subsequent Amendment under the same tracking number as this special notice.  Many combat support conditions across the full spectrum of military operations restrict operational prerogatives.  Initial forces often arrive with minimal support and resources.  Equipment and systems may be constrained by limited airlift or sealift.  Pre-positioned assets in areas of operations may be constrained by international agreements or lack of agreements.  Bed-down plans, transportation, and manpower may be constrained by short-notice response times, budget shortfalls, or force reductions.  Innovative, concepts potentially serve to offset these constraints.  Operating locations may be required to support other military branches and/or allied military forces.  Information on systems, tactics, and techniques that require less inter theater airlift and fewer personnel to support, erect, and maintain operations are requested.  Present combat support resources are aging and are quickly becoming technically obsolete.  Viable concepts/solutions shall include those that are projected to mature within the following timeframes: Near-term- (2010-2015), Mid-term- (2016-2025), Far-term- (2026-2035).  All viable concepts will be entered under the ongoing FSA.  The operational benefits of reducing personnel requirements and logistical footprint are of particular interest and cannot be over stated in this request.  Concept data should provide sufficient detail regarding processes, technologies, approaches and capabilities for the Government to meaningfully assess the concept?s viability, risk, scope of development and procurement costs as well as correlation to the Agile Combat Support capability topics listed under amendment one.  Submission of concepts under this special notice will require the use of a Concept Template provided separately in an amendment to this Special Notice using the same tracking number.  Each concept/solution shall specify sufficient detail, not to exceed 3 pages, in describing potential viability.  The template format shall be followed in order for a concept submission to be considered responsive.  Each response must be received at the: 688th Armament Systems Squadron,  314 Choctawhatchee Avenue, Suite 104, Bldg. 40, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5717, no later than close of business: 20 September in order
for it to be considered.  Data submissions must be delivered via Email (using the MS Word template file provided), or a PDF Formatted attachment, or via authorized delivery means for documents authorized under DOD procedures.  Mark all proprietary information ?For Government Use Only.?  MAWG government representatives from across the entire US Air Force will technically score all responsive concept submissions.  This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment by the US Government.  Any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer which could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract.  The Government does not intend to award any contract on the sole basis of this special notice, nor shall the US Government otherwise pay for any information solicited under this special notice.  For additional information on requested technologies or concepts, please contact Stephen Lambeth USAF civilian employee at (850) 883-3269.

<DESC>This sources sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health to identify small business sources (including veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) business, and women-owned small business concerns) that are capable of performing the following requirements:

Fabrication of Multielectrode Arrays (MEAs) specifically optimized for use in the NIDCD mission areas of voice, speech, hearing, and balance. Novel fabrication techniques are required for precise and rapid construction of MEAs suitable for use in chronic animal studies, although the materials and fabrication techniques to be developed should be adaptable for eventual use in human subjects. Outside groups will utilize these electrodes in chronic animal studies and subsequently provide requests for specific modifications or refinements in the electrode design and construction. New MEA variations will then be constructed and distributed under this award in order to support cycles of electrode design and testing for neural prosthesis development.

Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Contracts Competency (AIR 2.0) is seeking potential vendors/schools capable of providing an educational brief/survey on the Aerospace Industry to approximately 650 NAVAIR contracting personnel.     

1.0        BACKGROUND

           One of the key management objectives of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Contracts Competency is for its contracting professionals to better understand the key financial and business motivations of the Aerospace Industry.     This management objective supports DODs emphasis on smarter acquisitions while continuing to support the needs of the Services.     The Aerospace Industry has historically been successful in educating itself on the inner workings of the various DOD organizations in an effort to better understand their customers.     The NAVAIR Contracts Competency asserts that it is equally important for its employees to have knowledge of the motivations and decision points of its key suppliers.     Mutual understanding makes for healthier business relationships.           

2.0       SCOPE

           This Request for Information (RFI) outlines a potential requirement for an educational brief/survey on the Aerospace Industry to approximately 650 NAVAIR contracting personnel in the NAVAIR Contracts Competency (NAVAIR Code 2.0).

The term NAVAIR Code 2.0 includes all contracts specialists at all sites.)     The brief/survey will provide a comprehensive look into the overall health of the Aerospace Industry with an objective of helping the civilian and military contracting personnel at NAVAIR better understand the financial and business motivations of the Aerospace Industry.

<DESC>Q: I was wondering if this market survey is to replace the two contracts issued under solicitation N66001-01-R- 0016 (contracts N66001-03-D-0036 and N66001-03-D-0037).  Those two contracts are for engineering and tech support services to the UHF MILSATCOM system.  If those are not the incumbent contracts for this requirement, is there an incumbent for it?  And do you know if there is an intention to re-compete the requirement for those two contracts? A: The market survey is not intended to replace, nor is it connected to, contracts N66001-03-D-0036 and N66001-03-D-0037. There is no existing incumbent for the market survey. I am not able to answer as to the intention to re-compete the requirements for N66001-03-D-0036 and N66001-03-D-0037 as they are not SPAWAR Headquartersâ contracts. â Maureen Zajano, Contract Specialist, SPAWAR HQ.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, GCA Systems, In c. 2233 South Presidents Drive, West Valley City, UT 84120 for upgrade to the Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) at the Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) in Tobyhanna, PA 18466.   The systems proprietary Warehouse Management System (WMS) was develop ed in the year 2000 by the proprietor and staff of what is now GCA Systems working as a subcontractor. Subsequently GCA provided remedial and preventive maintenance including software upgrades and fixes either as a subcontractor or recently as a prime cont ractor. At present the only party known to have the proprietary rights to the system software as upgraded through the present revision level is the proposed contractor GCA Systems. The primary objective of the upgrade is to provide the ability to track par ts on the shop floor. The Government does not have a competitive technical data package for upgrade to the TYAD ASRS system. The TYAD ASRS WMS software is proprietary to GCS Systems. Therefore, GCS Systems is the only firm known to provide the required sys tem upgrade. Any firms believing they can provide the required service should contact the Contract Negotiator identified within ten (10) days of this notice.  The NAICS Code is 333922 and the size standard is 500 employees. W25G1V-07-R-0003 applies.

<SUBJECT>A -- Low-Cost Method of Producing Aluminum Oxynitride
<DESC>Idaho National Laboratory, managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance is offering the opportunity to license and commercialize the technology. The INL would like to identify industrial partners capable of providing funds-in and cost share towards development of low-cost aluminum oxynitride (AlON). The INL seeks parties interested in production of low-cost aluminum oxynitride. 

Technology: The INL has demonstrated and is further refining a novel process to form aluminum oxynitride by a pressureless sintering method.  Thie INL approach has the potential to reduce costs for manufacture of AlON enabling use of this material in transparent armor applications for commercial and military use.


Development Status: The INL has currently developed some samples for testing. INL has filed a patent application covering the invention and is evaluating a second invention disclosure for a second patent application.

Benefits: A pressureless sintered aluminum oxynitride with comparable ballistic performance to hot pressed AlON that is made by a simplified processing method.  Transparent aluminum oxynitride ceramic offers the potential of ballistic protection with a commensurate weight savings compared to traditional glass/polymer-based transparent armor. Additionally, this affordable manufacturing process would enable the production of low-cost aluminum oxynitride for use in a variety of transparent armor systems to protect against bullet and explosion, i.e. cars, trucks, helicopters, fighter jets, and windows. 

THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Companies and/or interested parties who feel they are capable of performing this project are invited to indicate their interest by providing the INL a brief summary of their capabilities, including brief description of facilities, personnel, and existing manufacturing experience as it relates. 

Please provide your written statement of interest within 30 days from the date this announcement is published to ensure your consideration.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Custom Laser System
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health(NIH)National Institute on Deafness(NIDCD)intends to procure from Mike's Machine Company the following: 

We are currently using multiple custom laser scanning systems from Mike?s Machine Company and we would like this instrument to be compatible with them, allowing us to maintain experimental consistency with previous research. Mike's Machine Company is the sole manufacturer of this equipment.

These instruments will be a base instrument for an elaborate custom designed system and should adhere to the following specifications. 

Requirements: 

 

1. The Custom Laser System must mount on the base of an Olympus BX51WI and allow installation of an Olympus fluorescence condenser on its upper surface. 

 

2. The Custom Laser System must allow installation of Cambridge Optical 6210 (4mm) scanning galvanometers. 

 

3. The system must allow installation of the Olympus FV-PL-W3 pupil transfer lens. 

 

4. The translation stage must be physically compatible with the Olympus BX51WI microscope and allow specimen placement with submicron precision for cellular recording and imaging. 

 

 

5. The Translation stage stepper motors must interface with the Sutter MP285 controller for automated computer control of specimen movement in x, y, and z axes. 

 

6. The Sutter MP285 controller must be modified for use with stepper motors present in the translation stage (TS-BX51WI).  

enables combined two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy with electrophysiological (patch-clamp) recordings. I (Stephan Brenowitz) have collaborated with a precision machinist (Tim Lafratta) at Mike?s Machine Company to design custom optical components that interface between an infrared Ti-Sapphire pulsed-laser and Olympus BX51WI upright microscope for laser-scanning microscopy. In addition the system includes a custom translation stage and controller that are designed to be used with the scan system and microscope and work with custom software that we have written for computer control of imaging and electrophysiology data acquisition. 

we are currently using multiple custom laser scanning systems from Mike?s Machine Company and we would like this instrument to be compatible with them, allowing us to maintain experimental consistency with previous research. 
This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals however, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statment and any other information furniished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficeint detail to allow NIH to determine if the party meets all of the foregoing requirements.

The University of Texas at Austin is the only authorized entity in the Coastal Bend area of Texas which is permitted to respond to sea turtle strandings in this part of Texas.

This requirement is for continuations and improvement of part of the existing stranding network established in 1980. This requirement is for a 12-month base period beginning September1 through August 31, 2008.

Minimum Requirements: 1) Contractors must have permission of owners of San Jose Island to conduct surveys on this privately owned island, 2) Contractor must possess valid current permits to handle Endangered and Protected Species, as required by the Endangered Species Act. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten (10) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>R -- FORMAL NOTICE OF A PERFORMANCE DECISION FOR AN A-76 COMPETITIVE SOURCING STUDY
<DESC>This notification represents a formal public announcement of a performance decision and completion of a streamlined competition study conducted by the Program Support Center, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The study period for this competition was April 16, 2007 through August 20, 2007, under FBO Reference Number A76HHSPSCFMSDFOGABINTERGOVERNMENTALANDREVOLVINGFUNDS.  On August 20, 2007, the resulting certification of the streamlined competition form by the responsible competition officials indicated that the performance of the Intergovernmental and Revolving Fund Management functions should remain in-house with the agency's Most Efficient Organization (MEO).  As a result of this performance decision, the designated Contracting Officer will execute an MEO Letter of Obligation with the agency official responsible for the performance of this commercial activity.  Consequently, no solicitation will be issued for these commercial services.

The purpose of this A-76 study was to determine the least costly and most efficient methods of operation as prescribed in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities, which sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity.  Consistent with procurement integrity, ethics, and standards of conduct rules, including restrictions of 18 U.S.C. 208, the responsible Contracting Officer submitted the streamlined competition form to the agency's incumbent service provider for review prior to this public announcement of a performance decision. 

In accordance with the streamlined procedures as specified in OMB Circular A-76, revised May 2003, the streamlined competition form shall be made available to the public upon request.  It is further noted that no party may contest any aspect of a streamlined competition.

The brand name justification is as follows.  CID requires GPS units to assist in the efficient and successful undertaking of its criminal investigation duties.  Last year, CID purchased 20 Garmin handheld GPS units and accessories for CIDs twenty largest offices.  Currently, CID requires GPS units and accessories for its twenty-three additional offices.  At the time of last years purchase, CID created a training program for its agents centered on the previously acquired Garmin units.  If another GPS brand was purchased, CID would be forced to develop and conduct a new training regiment, creating a superfluous outlay of both time and money. Furthermore, identical GPS units will be interchangeable with the mapping software and accessories units bought last year.   This would allow for an efficient use of time and capital, both now and in the future, by eliminating the need to purchase redundant accessories and permitting a seamless and interchangeable consistency between the equipment of the agents.<BR><BR>

Below are the required documents for Brand Name Justification and Approval

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR BRAND NAME
PR NR: FA4803-07-Q-A288

This Justification and Approval is prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 6.303-2.

I.	Identification of the Agency and Contracting Activity:  USCENTAF/A7 and 20th Contracting Squadron, Shaw AFB, SC 29152-2610.

II.	Nature and/or Description of Action:  A brand name request from the customer was received in support of the purchase of 62 MultiRAE Plus Gas Detectors and associated accessories.  

III.	Description of Supplies/Services:  The purchase request is for 62 MultiRAE Plus Gas Detectors and associated accessories.  The existing system does not meet the current requirement of ACC.  The upgrade will provide up to date services for creating and processing wireless information.  .  

IV.	Identification of Statutory Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (2) or 41 U.S. C. 253(c) (2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (4) (c), ?Application for brand name descriptions. An acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited. It shall be justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304.?  ?The justification should indicate that the use of such descriptions in the acquisition is essential to the Government?s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.?

V.         Applicability of Authority:  RAE Systems states and certifies that the wireless gas detection system quoted by RAE Systems are manufactured, quoted and/or sold directly to end-using agencies/clients by RAE Systems only.  
 
VI.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  RAE Systems is the sole source for this equipment item.  RAE Systems sells the equipment directly to local, state and federal governmental agencies, DoD, DOE, environmental and clean up contractors, fire departments and Haz-Mat response teams.

VII.	Fair and Reasonable Pricing:  The price obtained for this requirement is deemed fair and reasonable based on the need for the unique design, operability, and compatibility requirements. 

VIII.  	Market Research:  Market Research was conducted by locating a small dis-advantage business associated with RAE Systems that can provide MultiRae Detectors.  

IX.	Additional Facts:  Recent events demonstrated that our deployed Civil Engineer (CE) Readiness forces are not equipped to recon the full spectrum of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical and Toxic Industrial Material (TIC/TIM) threats that our forces can expect to encounter and in some instances have encountered.  The objective is to increase force protection capability regarding asymmetric use of TIC/TIM and to quickly posture a capability.  CE Readiness forces currently deploy with legacy chemical detectors that are not capable of detecting TIC/TIM hazards.  An immediate requirement is a capability to detect and identify chlorine vapors.  This detector is critical to Readiness and Emergency Management Flight personnel to ensure force survivability and mission continuation.  

X.	Interested Parties:  There were no other interested sources found.

XI.	Overcoming Competition Barriers:  RAE Systems has a small business affiliation that can provide this equipment item.  

XII.	Contracting Officer?s Certification:  This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer?s knowledge and belief.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to:

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Quotation (RFQ), HSCG84-07-Q-3P, incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18. This is an unrestricted procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code is 611699, size standard is $6.5M. An award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures, in accordance with FAR Part 13, as a firm fixed-price purchase order.

Description: Provide supplies and services to conduct Air Quality Health Risk Assessment, per following Statement of Work (SOW), at the U. S. Coast Guard Sector Houston-Galveston. The period of performance is from 9/24/2007 through 5/23/2008.

SCOPE OF WORK (SOW)

Provide SECTOR Houston ? Galveston with exposure data and symptom / quality of life data that will be analyzed to identify and determine the statistical significance of short and long term associations or trends that result from working inside the main administrative building.

Associations or trends will include but will not be limited to:
Outdoor and indoor air quality over time;
The concentration ratio of outdoor and indoor airborne chemical contaminants and symptom rates over time;
Association between concentration ratios and quality of life indicators over time; and Any combination of the above variables in relation to each other.

1.2 STUDY / STUDY DESIGN.
Design will combine environmental and symptom survey data that is temporally matched.  Collection of environmental data will be temporally randomized.  Coast Guard will add airborne chemical environmental data to the study that is event-driven; resulting from sampling when there is a known chemical release or a significant odor is detected which signals a chemical release.

One or more local Houston-area Coast Guard control populations are required; at a minimum the USCG Houston air station at Ellington Field will serve as a control.  A control will allow data comparison and determination if relocation would provide a significantly different working environment.  Control data can be selected from environmental, symptom and/or quality of life indicators.

DATA ANALYSIS.
Study data will be analyzed by an Epidemiologist or Biostatistician in conjunction with the study team.

SAMPLING.
Sampling media and/or instruments will be used to collect a sufficient volume of outdoor and indoor air over a pre-determined period and analyzed by a suitable standard methodology.
Sampling will include at least two indoor and one outdoor area.
Sampling will be of sufficient volume and duration to allow a limit of quantification at least equal to the exposure criteria.
The duration of sampling will match the time-averaging period required by the exposure criteria. 
Sampling will include a suitable number of field and media blanks.
Survey ? accomplished via the internet or by email.  Questionnaire will collect building occupant symptoms, metadata, and quality of life indicators.

MEASURES.
Analysis of at least 30 chemicals by commercial or research laboratory.
Chemicals must include: benzene, isopropanol, acetone, xylene, ethylbenzene, toluene, styrene, isobutane, 2-heptanone and total hydrocarbons, pyrene, naphthalene and anthracene as indicators of asphalt-based polyaromatic airborne chemicals.

For a period to include the study duration, gather publicly available National Ambient Air Quality Standards data from the closest NAAQS sampling station to Section Houston-Galveston.

Indoor and outdoor particulate matter concentrations by particle size as measured by Coast Guard owned TSI Dustraks.  Particle size discrimination must include PM 2.5.

Indoor and outdoor temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.

Symptom Survey ? building occupants will be assigned an online survey account number and will be asked to provide one-time baseline (metadata) information (name, gender, birth date, tenure, position, physical location, work hours, etc?)

Quality of Life Indicators (QLI) ? stress, noise, odors, etc.  Building occupants will provide this information in addition to symptoms.  Noise levels will be assessed during periods of peak outdoor noise associated with the activities of surrounding industrial areas.

EVALUATION CRITERIA.
Evaluation criteria will include acute and chronic criteria from:
Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC) health-based Effects Screening Levels (ESL) and ATSDR Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs).

ASSUMPTIONS.
The outdoor air sampling location will be fixed, and close as possible to the outdoor air intake to the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning system(s).  This location will be considered representative of outdoor air locations, even though concentrations of chemicals in other outdoor areas may actually be lower or higher than measured values.

Indoor air sampling locations will be of a number such that they are representative of distinct areas of the building.  For example, distinct floors or separate built environments within the building that house distinct populations of individuals.  These locations will be considered representative of indoor concentrations of chemicals at those locations.

1.3 STUDY TEAM COMPOSITION/STRUCTURE.
U. S. Coast Guard Team: Detached Safety and Environmental Health Officer (SEHO), New Orleans, LA; USPHS Environmental Health Officer (EHO), Norfolk VA; SECTOR Project Coordinator (SPC), Houston; and SECTOR Sampling Coordinator (SSC), Houston.

Contractor Team: Leaders to include an Industrial Hygienist, Occupational Physician,  and Biostatistician or, Epidemiologist. Team leaders must be published researchers recognized in their fields as experts in environmental studies dealing with ambient and indoor air quality.

SCHEDULING.
Study team members will develop a sampling schedule that provides data for a six-month period.

SITE VISITS. All prospective contractors are strongly encouraged to do a site visit before submitting quotes/proposals. To arrange a visit, please contact the Project Officer, LCDR Harrichand Rhambarose at (757) 628-4426 or e-mail: Harrichand.Rhambarose@uscg.mil.

The Coast Guard will evaluate quotes/offers and will make a best-value award resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quote/offer conforms to this solicitation and is determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on ability to meet basic requirements, delivery, and price.

The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this RFQ, and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions To Offerors Commercial Items (Sept 2006), FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (Nov 2006), FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions?Commercial Items (Feb 2007), FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (May 2007), and FAR Clause 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for an extended field-of-view (FOV) integrating sphere light source for absolute calibration of imaging spectrograph instrumentation is required. Requirements are as follows:  Sphere configuration requirements:  The source shall be a 12 in. diameter sphere with a 4 in. diameter exit port. An optional, removable reducer shall be included to reduce the exit port diameter to 2 in. The source shall allow operation with the exit port facing horizontally or, optionally, downward. A mounting flange for attaching the source exit port to NASA Ames instrumentation shall be included. The flange is primarily for alignment reproducibility and is not intended to be a load-bearing attachment. The frame supporting the sphere shall be load-bearing for horizontal or downward orientations. Detailed mechanical drawings and mechanical requirements for supporting the sphere in the horizontal or downward orientations shall be included in the offer. Ports for nitrogen cooling and purging shall be incorporated.  Light sources and spectral radiance performance requirements:  The spectral range of the source shall be from &lt; 250 nm to &gt; 1700 nm. The reflectance coating of the sphere shall have maximum performance and lifetime in the ultraviolet region; offerers shall include documentation of the coating specifications. The sphere shall have a combination of external xenon arc and tungsten-halogen light sources and an internal tungsten-halogen source(s). The sources shall be independently controlled to tailor the spectral radiance output for maximum performance over three spectral subregions: ultraviolet to visible (250 - 600 nm); visible to near infrared (500 - 900 nm); near infrared (800 - 1700 nm). The sphere source shall meet or exceed the following absolute spectral radiance performance specifications consistent with independent (or all) lamp configurations described above: &gt; 3.2 W/cm3 sr at 300 nm; &gt; 330 W/cm3 sr at 500 nm; &gt; 1600 W/cm3 sr at 800 nm; &gt; 1800 W/cm3 sr at 1100 nm; &gt; 880 W/cm3 sr at 1700 nm. The luminance uniformity over the 4 in. dia. exit port shall be &gt; 96%. The expected lamp lifetimes shall also be documented in the offer.  System performance monitoring and control requirements:  The light sources shall have motorized variable attenuators. The attenuators shall also act as shutters to inhibit output while the lamps are operating. The variable output shall be controlled to 256 or greater linear steps from 0 to 100%. The sphere shall include a radiometer for monitoring luminance. An option for a spectroradiometer for monitoring spectral radiance shall also be included in the offer. The source absolute radiance shall be scaled to the radiometer (or spectroradiometer) output to enable control of spectral radiance at settings below full output power. The lamp usage shall be monitored automatically.  Calibrations:  The source shall have NIST-traceable absolute spectral radiance calibrations for the full-power configurations of the lamp sources (e.g. xenon only, tungsten-halogen only; all). The spectral resolution of the calibration shall be 10 nm or less. At minimum, the spectral radiance calibration shall be certified for wavelengths between 300 nm to 1700 nm. Additionally, certified spectral radiance calibration at wavelengths below 300 nm or above 1700 nm are preferred. A spatial map of source luminance uniformity mapping shall be included. The time over which the calibrations are valid (i.e. lamp hours, calendar dates) shall also be documented.  Warranties:  Offers shall include terms of post-sale warranties and performance guarantees. Deliverables:  Complete integrating sphere system (sphere, light sources, power supplies, control electronics)  Luminance monitor(s)  Calibration certificates  Safety and hazard analyses  Manuals  The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-19.

Originator?s Code  PL512
Procurement Request Number MIPR7LDITCO042

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Section 4202 (10 U.S.C. 2304). 


JUSTIFICATION

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity.  Defense Information Systems Agency, DITCO-Europe/PL512, Building 143, Sembach-Heuberg, Germany

2.  Nature/Description of Action(s). Requirement is for the purchase of NETAPPS equipment under the 7th Army Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) Directorate and Operational Command Post (OCP) Intelligence infrastructure at Campbell Barracks Building 12.  The 7th Army ISR is the transformation of the USAREUR G2 and 66th Military Intelligence (MI) Group agencies.  This procurement includes Storage Device procurements and upgrades for SCI and SIPRNET environments. A firm-fixed price commercial item type contract is planned and will be issued pursuant to FAR 13.5.  All brand name Network Appliance resellers who submit offers will be considered for award on a lowest cost, technically acceptable basis.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services.  Network Appliance (NETAPPS) Shelves to support the transformation of the USAREUR G2 and 66th Military Intelligence (MI) Group agencies. 

Item 1: DS14A-R5 Rackmount Kit,4N2,DS14-Middle,R6, X5515A-R6, 5 EA.
Item 2: DS14A-R5 Power Cable continental Euro, R6, X800B-R6, 10 EA., 
Item 3: DS14MK2 SHLF, ACPS, 14X300GB,10K, HDD,ES, X900A-ESH2-QS-R5, 5 EA.
Item 4: DS14A-R5 CBL, 0.5M Patch, FC, SFP to SFP-C, R6, X6530-R6, 10 EA., 
Item 5: DS14A-R5 SupportEdge Standard- Mths: 36, CS-A, 5 EA.
Item 6: Non Returnable Disk Fee Mths: 36, CS-NRD-FEE, 5 EA., 

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.  Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Section 4202 (10 U.S.C. 2304). The NETAPPS equipment is peculiar to one manufacturer.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.  

This brand name of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program, and economy of resources across the U.S. Army-Europe AOR.  Thus far in the Army European Intelligence Community Netapps has accounted for all the storage devices purchased and installed to support the SIPR and JWICS Networks for USAREUR G2.  Procuring and installing non-Netapps components to an existing Netapps filer will make the device inoperable and void the warranties of existing equipment, thereby causing unacceptable delays and additional costs to the command when maintenance is required.  The full replacement of all Netapps-installed base products on the Backbone Networks (in order to ameliorate the problem caused by using a different vendor?s equipment) would cost in excess of one million dollars.  This includes the costs for retraining personnel throughout USAREUR (such as project managers, engineers, installers) and for outfitting ASL/PLL stock reserves, and logistics support and maintenance.  Further information concerning Netapps?s distinct credentials follows: 


a.	The DoD Directive on Interoperability (DoDD 4630.5) defines it as, ?The ability of the systems, units, or forces to provide services to and accept services from other systems, units, or forces, and to use the services so exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together.?  NETAPPS storage devices enable USAREUR G2 and 66th MI Group to comply with this directive. 

b.	Using a variety of different shelves not meeting the criteria identified above would trigger the following support issues:

(1)	Additional funding would be required to purchase PLL and ASL, since the current stock levels are oriented toward supporting NETAPPS devices.  

(2)	Additional funds for training on multiple vendors? equipment would be required to provide the necessary training within the USAREUR G2 and 66th MI Group.  The current engineers? training has focused predominately on NETAPPS equipment.   

(3)	Additional funding would be required to initiate new maintenance and support contracts for all new non-NETAPPS equipment and/or components.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources.  The solicitation will be posted on FedBiz Opps.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable  Price.   The Contracting Officer will compete the requirement among resellers of Net App equipment on FedBiz Opps.  The price to the Government will be determined fair and reasonable prior to award based upon competition.

8.  Description of Market Research. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) standards for the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) call for use of NetApp equipment. 

9.  Any Other Supporting Facts.  None	

10.  Listing of Interested Sources.  The requesting activity used the Army Small Computer Program website to determine interest, as well as contacting other vendors known to be able to supply the required NetApp equipment.

<DESC>NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) in Silver Spring, MD, seeks to purchase two primary standard grade mercury calibration units for the routine calibration of automated gas-phase mercury sampling equipment at field sites at Beltsville, MD and at the Grand Bay (MS) National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR).

Currently, ARL has no capability to calibrate the automated mercury sampling equipment at its two field locations with a primary Hg(0) standard.  This request is submitted for the procurement and acquisition of two such primary standard.  The principle behind the calibration procedures relies on injecting a precisely known amount or concentration of elemental mercury vapor (Hg(0)) into the analyzer to be calibrated.  A precisely known amount of mercury must be delivered for the calibration of analytical systems; this amount is calculated based on the principle that the vapor pressure of mercury is a well known function of temperature.  If the temperature and volume of an injection are known, the amount of mercury delivered can be determined with high accuracy.  For this reason, vapor phase injection has become the de facto standard method of system calibration for ultra-trace mercury analytical systems.  Instrument response is then compared to that expected from calculated parameters.

Characteristics of the Desired Calibrator - The Calibration Unit Must:

-First and foremost be compatible with existing NOAA/ARL mercury sampling equipment, manufactured by the Tekran Corporation;
-Utilize a syringe to manually inject a precisely know amount of elemental mercury into the analyzer to be calibrated, as the ARL-owned Tekran systems are fitted with a special port for precisely this purpose;
-Interface directly with digital syringes to allowing continuous measurement of volume and instantaneous calculation of injection amount;
-Be rugged and self-contained, and portable to make it suitable for laboratory or field use;
-Be small (less than 16 x 12 x 12 inches) and weigh less that 12 pounds, for portability;
-Draw less than 2.5 amps max (12 VDC) when operating on battery power;
-Precisely regulate the temperature of the elemental mercury reservoir with a thermoelectric cooler, not a water bath, and precisely measure chamber temperatures and display them with digital display;
-Be capable of operation with line power or battery backup (12 VDC);
-Be equipped with an on-board microprocessor to automatically calculate amount of mercury injected based on either measured or input temperature and volume;
-Have a serial port to allow logging of injections, temperatures and other instrument parameters;
-Contain a pool of liquid mercury within a Teflon vessel, entirely enclosed within an insulated isothermal block.  A Teflon backed silicone septum must be used to seal the vessel;
-Contain two precision sensors, one to measure the temperature of the isothermal block and one to monitor the temperature within the vapor chamber;
-Have a temperature control accuracy of +/-0.05 degrees Celsius with resolution of .001 degrees Celsius;
-Have a measured temperature range of -5 to +50 degrees Celsius;
-Have a selectable temperature range of 0 - 30 degrees Celsius (Setpoint must be below ambient temperature) with an accuracy of +/-0.05 degrees Celsius and a stability of +/- 0.01 degrees Celsius.

Features and Capabilities of the Microprocessor and Communications Interface:

-Must have an internal microprocessor with LCD and direct access keypad;
-Must measure and display temperature of mercury chamber;
-Must control and display the temperature of the cold block containing the Teflon chamber;
-Must allow input of injection volume (either manually or automatically) to facilitate calculation of injected amount of elemental mercury;
-Must calculate amount of elemental mercury injected into detector;
-Must control internal battery charging and power management systems;
-Must log temperatures, injections and internal parameters to RS-232 serial port

3.1.  The hotel shall provide approximately 46 to 55 standard guest rooms, bed and room sizes may vary, for the period of February 10 to February 15, 2008 (approximately 6 days/five nights).  Seminar participants will generally be checking in on Sunday, February 10, 2008 and checking out on Friday morning, February 15, 2008.  However, the number of guest rooms required each day will vary slightly, due to participants' early/late arrivals and early/late departures.  A late check out time is desirable for seminar participants that will be checking out on February 10, 2008.  A final rooming list will be provided to the hotel no later than thirty (30) days prior to the seminar start date; however, participant substitutions will be permissible up to the seminar start date.  Individual miscellaneous expenses (i.e., mini-bar, laundry, room service, internet fees, movies, etc.) will be the responsibility of each attendee.  Individual attendees will provide their own credit cards or method of payment at check-in to cover miscellaneous expenses charged to their rooms.  Approximately 70/80 percent of the cost of guest rooms will be paid by the U.S. Government (USG) under the purchase order.  The remaining cost of the guest rooms will be paid by conference participants using their individual credit cards.  However, whether lodging is paid for under the purchase order or by individual participants, the room rate shall be at or below the Maximum Lodging Allowance specified by the USG's Travel Regulations for per diem.  The rooming list of CME Seminar participants will be annotated to identify which guest room costs are covered under the purchase order and which must be paid for by individual participants using their own credit cards.  

3.2.  Guest rooms shall be made available to CME Seminar attendees at the contracted room rate (at or below U.S. Government per diem) at least two days prior to the general check-in date and at least two days following the general check-out date (or from February 8 through February 17, 2008).  However, attendees checking in prior to February 10 or staying later than the morning of February 15 will be responsible for payment of any additional room nights, unless the hotel is notified in advance that the Government will be covering the cost of the additional stay under the purchase order.

3.3.  Quotations are to include the hotel pricing policy for extra adults and/or children sharing the same room.  Any expenses for additional adults and/or children above the contracted room rate will be the responsibility of each attendee.

7.0  EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS

7.1.  Quotations will be evaluated based on which hotel offers the Best Value to the USG, considering both technical factors and price.  The primary technical considerations will be whether the rooms, services, and equipment meet the stated requirements and are suitable for the intended purpose of the seminar.  This includes hotel location and amenities, which will be a dominant factor in award selection as stated in Section 2.0.  Generally, technical considerations will be slightly more important overall than price.  However, if technical considerations are determined to be similar (not significantly distinguishable), then price will have greater significance in award selection.

Total Price will be determined by computing the aggregate sum of all line item prices, including the prices for optional services (see Section 6.0).

7.2.  Site Visit.  As part of the technical evaluation, the USG reserves the right to conduct a site visit at each of the hotels that submits a quotation.  If a site visit is conducted, it will consist of one or more USG representatives meeting with the appropriate hotel staff, in order to evaluate the hotel in terms of meeting the seminar requirements.  The hotel shall provide a presentation by the sales manager and/or other appropriate staff to demonstrate the ability of the hotel to meet the stated requirements.

8.0  PRE-SEMINAR ACTIVITIES

8.1.  After the purchase order is awarded, the USG will provide the hotel with the following items at least two weeks in advance of the conference: Room set-up schematics; equipment requirements (see 6.2); and time schedules/daily agendas.

8.2.  Pre-Seminar Meeting.  Prior to the conference, the USG will schedule a pre-seminar meeting to be held at the hotel (anticipated to be held the Thursday or Friday prior to the seminar).  Any last minute changes (if applicable) will be addressed during the meeting.     

9.0  CANCELLATION

The Government reserves the right to a no-cost cancellation of this purchase order in the event/occurrence of unforeseen unusual circumstances, including, but not limited to natural disasters, that make holding the seminar impractical/impossible.

10.0  PRICING AND PAYMENT

The hotel shall provide in the quotation firm fixed prices for each of the items required above, or state "no charge" if the hotel is providing an item gratis.  Prices shall include (and indicate) all fees, services, set up, and tear down.  The invoice is not to include any extra charges (i.e., charges not specifically covered by the purchase order).  This purchase order will be a firm-fixed-price, requirements type (see 13.2 below).  All prices shall be in U.S. dollars, and payments will be made to the Contractor in U.S. dollars within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of an approved invoice.

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), using a two-step Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, is soliciting abstracts to conduct concept exploration R&D in support of the Army?s Army Technology Objective (ATO) entitled Aircrew Surviva bility Technologies (AST). This AST program is a 6.2 Applied Research effort encompassing four years with planned multiple awards. The AST ATO will develop technologies in the areas of conventional ballistic protection and crashworthiness with the intent o f substantially improving aircrew survivability over current capabilities.   The first step in the two-step process consists of receipt and review of abstracts summarizing the project that is to be the subject of a proposal.  The purpose of abstract review is to foster competition, provide feedback to prospective proposers relative  to the likelihood of being funded so that better decisions can be made regarding incurring cost for proposal submission.  Abstract feedback will be provided to facilitate an Offeror?s decision on whether to prepare a full proposal. Our response to an abst ract is advisory only.  The abstract should provide enough information to permit review against the evaluation criteria.  Feedback will consist of a qualitative assessment and recommendation relative to full proposal submission.  The second step in the two -step process consists of receipt and evaluation of proposals from which award decisions will be made.  Offerors who do not submit an abstract are permitted to submit a full proposal.  Every proposal will be subjected to the same comprehensive evaluation.  Submission of a full proposal is necessary in order to receive an award under this announcement.  There will be three abstract and proposal evaluation cycles as further discussed under General Information.  The two step approach benefits Offerors by allow ing them to disband proposal teams (if desired) after the abstract phase. It benefits the Government by alleviating time wasted associated with evaluating proposals which are not of sufficient technical interest/quality. SOLICITATION TOPICS:  There are two topics under this announcement:   TOPIC 01-2008:  Conventional Threat Protection  The U.S. Army has an ongoing interest in developing and maturing advanced technologies that increase aircraft and crew protection against conventional ballistic threats defined as, 7.62mm Ball, 7.62mm armor piercing (AP), and 12.7mm AP, with 14.5mm AP as a n objective for the future. Current armor has significant weight and/or cost penalties, due both to the materials used and its parasitic application, which limits the range and payload of the aircraft.  Lighter weight materials, such as ceramics and interm etallics; advanced backing materials, fabrication process improvements, and non-traditional system design approaches offer the promise of weight savings leading to improved aircraft performance in range and/or payload, while improving the level of ballisti c protection.  The objective of this effort is to develop and demonstrate through test innovative light weight, high level of protection armor systems for rotorcraft application.  As a minimum, the proposed solution system(s) should provide protection from  small caliber threats (threshold 7.62mm Ball, 7.62mm AP, and 12.7mm AP, all at service velocity, with 14.5mm AP as a future objective) at a threshold minimum of 33% (50-75% objective) reduced areal weight, compared to current state-of-the-art armor system s.  New materials, fabrication/processing techniques, and optimized system design technologies are expected to provide the greatest weight savings with potential for reducing production cost. The overall design of the armor, and supporting modeling and ana lysis tools used for design and optimization of these systems, validated through ballistic test, will be used to determine its effectiveness. TOPIC 02-2008:  Advanced Aircrew Protection  U.S. Army Aviation accident data shows that approximately 90 pe rcent of helicopter impact type accidents are survivable.  As a result, many helicopters have been upgraded with crash protection features such as energy absorbing crashworthy crew and troop seats; high energy absorbing landing gears; improved occupant res traint systems; and supplemental restraint systems including cockpit air bag systems.   However, as mission gross weights have grown and aircraft velocities have increased, the effectiveness of the features intended to prevent occupant fatalities and minim ize the number and severity of occupant injuries in a crash has decreased.   Advanced Aircrew Protection will address the subsystems constituents of crashworthiness, to include innovative and advanced energy absorbing concepts and devices, and active crash  energy sensing and management concepts/technologies to provide optimum crash protection to occupants of current and future aircraft in variable conditions while minimizing damage to aircraft and mission equipment.  As crashworthiness from a subsystems per spective is largely an energy management problem, efforts in this area are expected to yield at least a 25% increase in crash energy attenuation over current systems.   The advanced aircrew crash protection concepts and technologies must be developed with minimum adverse impact on weight, cost, space, and in-flight performance. ANTICIPATED FUNDING AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Anticipated funding for all awards by each topic is as follows. TOPIC 01-2008:  Conventional Threat Protection ? Approximately $5.7M ($1M FY08, $1.05M FY09, $1.55M FY 10, and $2.1M FY11).   TOPIC 02-2008:  Advanced Aircrew Protection ? Approximately $5.7M ($1M FY08, $1.05M FY09, $1.55M FY 10, and $2.1M FY11).   It is desired that proposals include a performance period of 12 to 24 months.  Offerors should clearly depict their proposed schedule and insure that the period of performance will be completed by September 30, 2011.  Both topics have the potential for mul tiple awards, which may address only part of the topic?s objectives.  Any award made under this announcement is subject to the availability of funds. TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  A variety of funding instruments are available depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.  Such instruments inclu de conventional contracts subject to the FAR, as supplemented, and Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371), which are more flexible than traditional Governme nt funding instruments.  Under TIAs or OTs it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  Cost participation may be in th e form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R pa ragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/32106r_041398/part34.pdf.  Contract type is negotiable, but the Offeror?s desire should be clearly stated in the cost proposal.  INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND SUBMITTAL OF ABSTRACTS:   Guidance provided in this section applies to all abstracts submitted under this announcement.  Offerors may submit abstracts that address different topics or propose different solutions under a single topic and each will be evaluated independently.  Offero rs may also submit abstracts that address only part of the problem under a topic.  Abstracts should be marked with the solicitation and topic number and shall not exceed five (5) pages in length.  Abstracts shall  include the following:   1. Proposed objectives, concepts, ideas, methodologies. 2. A clear statement of work citing specific tasks to be performed and approach to be taken; 3. A brief description of relevant past experience and capabilities;  4. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate delineating by fiscal year major cost items (e.g., material, subcontracts, labor, etc.) estimated number of labor hours and any proposed fee.    5. Funding Profile ? desired funding by fiscal year shall be identified (in the event we incrementally fund). All abstracts shall be submitted in four paper copies and electronic format on disc (PDF or MS Word) to the  following address: U.S. Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Attn: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Kenneth Hood), Building 401, Lee Boulevard, Room 117, F ort Eustis, Virginia 23604-5577.  Facsimile and electronic submission is not authorized under this announcement.   ABSTRACT EVALUATION:  Abstracts will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  scientific merit, Offeror?s capability, and the ROM cost.  Once the abstracts are reviewed, all Offerors will be sent a decision letter providing a qualitative assessment a nd a Government recommendation relative to full proposal submission.  Offerors whose abstracts are deemed to merit full proposal submission are invited to submit a proposal.  Offerors whose abstracts are not selected for full proposal submission are still given the opportunity to submit a full proposal if they wish.   PROPOSAL EVALUATION:  The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this sect ion.  Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  Each proposal will receive an adjectival rating supported by narrative.  The adjectival ratings and supporting narrative will be cons idered along with other factors including the extent of restrictions placed on technical data deliverables that limit the Government?s ability to further exploit the results of the research and cost to the Government.  The Government will develop an order of merit listing for each topic and for each of the three evaluation cycles contemplated under this Announcement.  Proposed cost/cost to the Government will be evaluated, as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness.  Any proposed cost share will be eval uated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art.  Any percentage of cost sharing proposed could result in greater evaluation credit.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The evaluation criteria are:  (1) the extent to which the proposed work satisfies the Army research need by use of innovative, efficient, affordable, and suitable approaches to the stated technical problem; (2) the merit of the Offeror?s proposed approach to accomplish the scientific and t echnical objectives; (3) the experience and qualifications of the scientists, engineers, technicians, and other proposed personnel; (4) the suitability and availability of proposed facilities; and (5) proposed cost to the Government.   SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:  Performance under Topics 01-2008 and 02-2008 will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 et. seq.) or the Export Administra tion Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C. App 2401 et seq.  Prior to award (if applicable), the successful offeror(s) will be required to provide an ?Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement? certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 52 30.25.  This certification may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FBA Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI  49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572.  Preaward access to or submission o f a classified proposal is not authorized.

The brand name justification is as follows.  CID requires GPS units to assist in the efficient and successful undertaking of its criminal investigation duties.  Last year, CID purchased 20 Garmin handheld GPS units and accessories for CIDs twenty largest offices.  Currently, CID requires GPS units and accessories for its twenty-three additional offices.  At the time of last years purchase, CID created a training program for its agents centered on the previously acquired Garmin units.  If another GPS brand was purchased, CID would be forced to develop and conduct a new training regiment, creating a superfluous outlay of both time and money. Furthermore, identical GPS units will be interchangeable with the mapping software and accessories units bought last year.   This would allow for an efficient use of time and capital, both now and in the future, by eliminating the need to purchase redundant accessories and permitting a seamless and interchangeable consistency between the equipment of the agents.<BR><BR>

C.) Evaluation Factors

M.1   General
a. The Government is conducting this source selection in accordance with the competitive negotiation source selection procedures contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), part 15.

b. In accordance with FAR 52.215 1 (f), the Government intends to award contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals represent the best value.  Per FAR Part 2, best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The Government will conduct the best value analysis using the factors listed in Section M.3.  In performing its best value analysis, the Government will compare any relevant differences among the evaluated proposals to determine which proposal offers the overall best value.  This effort will include comparing the strengths, weaknesses and risks associated with each offer.  

c. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contracts without discussions with offerors except clarifications if necessary as described in FAR 15.306(a) and will evaluate each offer on the basis of the offeror's initial proposal. Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors' best terms from a technical and price standpoint.

d. When conducting the evaluation, the Government may use data included by offerors in their proposals, as well as data obtained from other sources.  Each offeror is responsible for ensuring that the information provided is thorough, accurate, and complete.  

M.2   Basis for Award
The Government will make an award to the offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best overall value based on the pass/fail criterion and evaluation factors listed in M.3.

FSA has established a Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to evaluate proposals submitted for this acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated by the TEB members in accordance with the procedures contained in FAR part 15, and the Evaluation Factors hereinafter described.

Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each offeror?s proposal in accordance with the pass/fail criterion and evaluation factors listed in M.3.  In determining the best value to the government after all Pass/Fail criterion are passed, the Cost and Privacy& Security are significantly more important than the Solution & Past Performance.  The price evaluation will not be point scored.  If all Pass/Fail criterion are passed then the proposal will be then considered, scored and evaluated against the evaluation factors in M.3.   
M.3   52.212-2 Evaluation ? Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

a.)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government, pass/fail criterion and other factors considered. 

All of the Pass/Fail Criterion must be passed in order to be considered for further evaluation and consideration. 

The following factors will be used to evaluate offers in accordance with the following rating schedules after all Pass/Fail Criterion have been met.

i. Privacy and Security (400 pts) - The Government will evaluate the offeror?s privacy and security capabilities which will ensure 100% Government confidentiality for electronic, printed and distributed documents.  The Government will evaluate the offeror?s network security and all security measures that are available in order to ensure information is not taken out of the facility. 

The Offeror who successfully describes and addresses all areas of security and privacy which meets the Government?s requirements that are realistic, relevant and complete, will receive a higher score than offerors who fail to do so.  

ii. Solution and Past Performance (200 pts) - The Government will evaluate the quality 
control plan which should address how, in partnership with the government, the offeror will manage and mitigate project risk and project scope.  The Government will evaluate the efficiency of the process which will be most efficient to completing the required turn around times for both the Form 1099 and Disbursement Transaction Statements.  

The Government will evaluate the ease of use and content of the activity tracker and reporting systems that will be utilized to display pertinent information requested by the Government.  

The Government will evaluate past performance based on phone calls to past customers which demonstrates their capability and capacity to deliver high quality service and solutions.  The past performance evaluation will examine the Offeror?s actual performance on at least two (2) efforts.  This review will focus on the size, scope and complexity of the efforts, relevance and outcome.

The assessment of the Offeror?s past performance will be used as one means of evaluating the credibility of the Offeror?s proposal and the relative capability of the Offeror.  A record of marginal or unacceptable past performance may be considered an indication that the ability of the Offeror to perform the contract as proposed may be questionable.  An Offeror with an exceptional record of past performance will receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is only acceptable.
iii. Price ? The Government will evaluate price from lowest to highest.  The lowest price will have a more favorable evaluation then a higher price. 
*Technical and past performance,when combined, are more important than price.

1.)A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
M.4 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990)

Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

***End of Amendment 01***


Background

The National Library of Medicine utilizes the most advanced information technologies to provide audiences around the globe access to the world's largest collection of biomedical information. With a robust Exhibition Program, the institution's exhibitions educate visitors about science, medicine, and technology while introducing them to the Library's services. As an extension of its commitment to using technology to advance scientific knowledge and expand access to biomedical information, the National Library of Medicine is adding an audio guide service for its exhibition visitors. Through the adaptation of cutting edge audio tour technology, the Library will be providing an enhanced educational experience to people touring the exhibition. People will be able to access additional content, images, or videos that would otherwise not be available. The Library will be able to accommodate larger tour groups without disturbing researchers while augmenting the content with sophisticated audio programming.

Requirements

Extensive experience in working with museum and cultural institutions to produce self-guided audio tour experiences for diverse audiences is required. An extensive client list is important to evidence proven ability to meet the demands of large cultural institutions. The proposed audio tour program for the National Library of Medicine is considered an extension of its commitment to using technology to advance scientific knowledge and expand access to biomedical information. Through the adaptation of cutting edge audio tour technology, the Library will be providing an enhanced educational experience to people touring the exhibition. Potential sources must evidence extensive experience in successfully adapting the content of the scope and nature of the Library's past exhibition projects into creative and engaging audio tour formats. Potential sources should also cite any awards their productions or equipment have received in the past.  
  
Special consideration should be given in responding to the requirement for the programming requirements of exhibit, ?Against the Odds: Making a Difference in Global Health?. Prospective sources shall evidence the ability to provide multilingual productions, preferably through an international client list. Because the content of Against the Odds is focused on Global Health, the audio tour production must appeal to a multicultural audience and available in multiple languages. It is understood this level of cultural awareness and sensitivity is shown by the company's familiarity with cultural institutions outside of the United States.
