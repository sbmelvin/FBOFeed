<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to charter a LEAR Jet 25C to support deployment of remote sensing instruments: Airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL), Langley Airborne A-band Spectrometer (LAABS), and the HyperSpectral Polarimeter for Aerosol Retrievals (HySPAR).  These instruments operate only in a pressurized, temperature-controlled environment and acquire observations in a nadir-viewing geometry.  A pressurized aircraft with down-looking aircraft port windows of significant aperture are required to accommodate these and other anticipated instruments (e.g., two approximately 10 in. by 12 in. rectangular ports or similarly sized circular ports).   The instruments that will be flown on the aircraft are developmental.  It is anticipated that the instruments will require significant adjustments and frequent removal from the aircraft and transport to LaRC for rework of faulty subsystems.  To make frequent instrument rework practical without the expense of frequent investigator travel and instrument shipping, it is required that the Contractor provide a base of operations for the aircraft within a reasonable commuting distance of Langley Research Center (LaRC), Hampton, VA. The government's statement of work (SOW)is provided as Attachment 1. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from L-3 Communications Flight International Aviation LLC (CFIA).  CFIA is the only known source capable of providing a Lear Jet 25C aircraft with the required capabilities and configuration to support deployment of the sensing instruments. FAR 13.501 is the authority for procuring from a sole source. The government intends to acquire commercial services using FAR 12 and 13.5 procedures. The government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDQ)type contract consisting of a one-year Base Period and four, one-year Option periods. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 4, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  As a minimum, responses shall include an explanation and verfication that the offeror can comply with each aircraft requirement stipulated in Attachment 1 -SOW. Offerors proposing an aircraft requiring modifications that can not be completed prior to award (anticipated award date is on or about July 1, 2004), will be determined non-responsive. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 223-04-5505 entitled "Access to Inpatient Drug Utilization Data" using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990.  This procurement will be a fixed-price, indefinite-quantity indefinite-delivery contract, with a base year plus two option years.  FDA plans to make award by September 30, 2004.  FDA is not interested in developing this database and expects any qualified organization to own the data as well as the means to access the data. 

The objectives of this contract are (1) to provide FDA personnel with immediate automated access to a currently existing, inpatient data resource with the capability of providing counts of discharges and/or patients utilizing drugs in an inpatient setting, and characterizing the hospital episode; (2) to provide FDA personnel with the ability to use the data to describe national patterns of drug utilization in the inpatient setting through the use of projection or other appropriate methodologies that are scientifically sound and transparent to FDA personnel; (3) to provide FDA personnel with direct, unlimited access to data in a multi-user environment and in real time; and (4) to provide FDA personnel with the ability to download (or obtain in a timely manner using other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies.

For the purpose of this contract, these data shall meet the need of the FDA to access discharge-level and/or patient-level data describing inpatient drug use in non-Federal, short-stay hospitals (average length of stay is 30 days or less).  The size and characteristics of the population of hospitals from which the data are derived shall be provided to the FDA, since these can affect the quality and usefulness of the data and the validity of national projections from the data.  Characteristics of the sample shall minimally include: number of hospitals, size of hospitals, geographic diversity of hospitals (using census regions if available), number of discharges per year, demographic distribution of discharges in the sample, numbers and percentages of discharges per year of special populations of interest to the FDA, including children (ages <17 years), elderly (ages >65 years), pregnancies and deliveries, and patients with serious illnesses including HIV/AIDS and mental illness, types of hospitals (teaching or non-teaching), and a description of specialty units within sample hospitals. Also, if available, the FDA would like to know the number of unique patients hospitalized per year in the sample and their demographic distribution. The FDA has no interest in knowing the identity of any patient, provider, or hospital included in the data resource.  It shall be solely the Offeror’s responsibility to de-identify the data and be HIPAA compliant for FDA use, but the methods used to de-identify the data shall be described.

The following data management information shall be provided to the FDA: the number of years of valid data available overall and in real time to FDA personnel; the process and procedures for accessing data that are no longer on-line; the lag time between the date of service for the hospitalization and on-line availability of the data.  These characteristics are essential for determining whether the data meet the needs of the FDA for making timely regulatory decisions based on the most current, scientifically valid information available.

The Offeror shall also provide a description of the Offeror’s data acquisition process for the inpatient drug utilization data resource. All data flow and management procedures shall be described, including data acquisition, cleaning and editing procedures, specification and description of all coding systems used for diagnoses, procedures and drugs, methods for coding data, percentage of missing or incomplete information and method of coding missing data, availability of raw/sample numbers, as well as projected numbers, and the frequency with which data are updated and methods for updates.

The inpatient data shall be amenable to analysis at the discharge-level and/or patient-level.

Age and gender of the patient at hospitalization shall be required. If available, the FDA would like to know information on race/ethnicity of hospitalized patients, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.

Hospitalization episode data shall be required, and shall include the dates of hospitalization, the length of stay, all diagnoses and procedures related to the hospitalization, and discharge disposition.  The FDA would additionally like the following hospitalization episode information, if available: operating room and radiology procedure and drug data (anesthetics, contrast agents, etc.), microbiology data (cultures, sensitivities, antigen testing, etc.), information on admitting diagnosis, drugs at admission, and drugs at discharge. If available, a description of data available on procedures performed and drugs administered in operating rooms and radiology departments shall be provided and shall be accompanied by a description of the degree of bundling of this information with other data and any limitations on the usefulness of these data in making national estimates.

Data related to drug prescription in hospital shall be required for all drugs administered during the hospitalization episode, and shall include the generic and established name for the drug, strength, and dosage form.  Additionally, the FDA would like the following drug-related information, if available, for all administered drugs: date administered, treatment dose, and treatment duration. FDA requires the ability to use these data to estimate drug utilization patterns in the total U.S. inpatient population, or to a national sub-population of interest (e.g., children, women of child-bearing age, elderly).  

A complete data dictionary shall also be included.

This shall require the use of projection methodology, which shall be valid, reliable, and robust with regard to drug utilization specifically, and the methods fully disclosed.  If such methodology has not been developed, a commitment in the form of a detailed development plan, strategic outline and timeline to collaborate with FDA investigators to develop and implement it within 6 months is required.  Demographics and other relevant characteristics (e.g., projection factors) for discharges and/or patients included in the sample to be used for projection, as well as for the proposed universe, shall be included. 

To assist FDA in the evaluation process, a short-term, no cost trial subscription to the full, commercially available data resource as of January 1, 2004 shall be required.  FDA researchers shall use the tool to conduct drug-, condition- or demographic-specific queries to demonstrate the completeness, efficiency and ease of using the product.  During this short-term trial access period, the FDA shall only use the data for the purposes of evaluation of the data resource.  FDA shall not use the data, nor any analyses derived from the data, for public disclosure or regulatory decision-making.  In addition, Offerors must be able to meet the following minimum mandatory requirements: verification of commercial availability of the data resource as of January 1, 2004; verification that the database is accessible real-time via Internet or network-based methods, as of January 1, 2004; documentation that the database has a minimum of 100 hospitals contributing data as of January 1, 2004; confirmation that the Offeror shall provide a short-term trial subscription for a minimum of one and a maximum of four FDA researchers.  This trial subscription shall include direct access, documentation, and technical support for the entire trials subscription period.  The Offeror shall provide FDA with a description of the process for downloading (or obtaining by other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies; upon award, the Offeror shall agree to provide unlimited access to the data for FDA's internal use without prior restraint, e.g., institutional review board (IRB) approval.  FDA acknowledges that any external release of results based on these data may be subject to mutually agreed-upon disclosure policies.

The solicitation for this requirement will be available on or about June 14, 2004.

Capability statements from interested small businesses are requested. The capability statement should specifically address your company’s ability to satisfy the requirements described in this synopsis.  Interested small businesses should email a Word file not to exceed 10 pages to the Contract Specialist at Kminker@oc.fda.gov by May 28, 2004.  No additional information about this requirement is available at this time; please do not call or email with questions that do not pertain to the request for a capability statement.

1.0 Purpose.  National Ocean Survey's Office of Coast Survey requires self contained, Moving Vessel Sound Velocity Profiler to integrate to the survey multibeams for hydrographic surveying. The basic requirement is for a free fall Sound Velocity Profiler, over-the -side deployment/recovery system, and computer controlled smart winch.  The system must be capable of autonomous operation without personnel on deck.  The system will have the capability to be monitored and controlled remotely.  The system must be sufficiently robust to be operated and maintained in the field by relatively inexperienced technicians.  
2.0 Specification. The following specifications are to ensure that the vehicle will perform at the level required for Hydrographic Survey.  2.1 Performance Specifications - 2.1.1 - Operating Depth:  No less than 100meters at 12 Knots.  2.1.2 - The fish will free fall with the vessel underway. Once the desired depth is reached, the fish will make an ascent to a shallow water towing position. Once this ascent is complete, the fish will be recovered or towed.  The free fall fish needs to be extremely stable so not to experience tow off provided the vessel does not execute a turn.  The system will collect and log SV data and also provide output of sv data in a format that will be accepted by survey multibeams.	2.2 Winch - 2.2.1 Hydraulic powered, with integral fail safe brake, and slip ring. 2.3 Sensor - The following sensor must be included on the unit. 2.3.1 - Real time Sound Velocity Sensor in a pressure housing. 2.4 Free Fall Fish - 2.4.1  A highly stable aerodynamic shaped body which is capable of being towed at 20 knots.  The fish will be equipped with a tail for stability, and capable of accommodating a variety of sensors.2.5 Deployment/Recovery - 2.5.1 - Integral to the base frame of the system will be a rotatable boom which is used to deploy and recover the free fall fish.  The boom will be instrumented to measure cable out.  The end of the boom will be equipped with a capture mechanism to positively capture the fish during recovery. 2.6 Control System - 2.6.1	 - The control system will be PC based. It will be equipped with a number of fail safes. The free fall fish can be set for deployment with three criteria that the control PC can use to abort the deployment. The criteria are: desired fish depth, height off bottom and a factory setting of maximum line out. If any of these criteria are met during the cast the PC will automatically stop the deployment and start a recovery.  2.7	 Installation Requirements - 2.71 The following items will be provided by the vessel for installation: Deck space required of not more than about 2.5 m x 1.2 m; 440 V, 3 Phase electrical power (50 or 60 Hz) (Winch Power);  Depth and position from the ship’s sounder/positioning system to be input into the control system NMEA string.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research is interested in receiving full technical and cost proposals addressing the development of a full scale (prototype), 36.5MW, Superconducting DC Homopolar Propulsion System Technology Demonstrator, appropriate to future Navy ships.  This advanced electric propulsion demonstrator must consist of a 36.5 MW/120 RPM direct drive propulsion motor compatible with podded propulsion applications, associated motor controller, transformer/switchgear, and controls and any ancillary equipment sufficient to demonstrate functionality and conduct system acceptance tests.  The proposed system should be compatible with future Navy combatant designs using an integrated power system (IPS).  The motor should also demonstrate viability for commercial/industrial applications such as cruise ship propulsion or large industrial drives.  A key aspect of the electric warship concept is that electric propulsion power can be made available and apportioned to ship service loads, propulsion, future weapon systems, high power sensors or other loads as dictated by mission requirements. Desired performance characteristics for the system include low weight, low acoustic and magnetic signature, shock tolerance, high reliability, high efficiency and operability.
This Broad Agency Announcement is directed specifically to superconducting dc homopolar motor approaches that can provide significant improvements over ship propulsion motors currently available or under engineering development.  Technical approaches are sought which will allow a substantial increase in torque and power density relative to the current state of the art, with weights, dimensions and aspect ratios that are also compatible with efficient podded propulsion of a Naval surface combatant.  High system efficiency at all motor operating speeds is desirable in combatant ship applications. Technologies of interest include (but are not limited to) superconducting windings and magnetics, efficient cryogenic cooling, direct liquid cooling for heat removal, intrinsically low acoustic noise machine design, and/or others that may overcome existing barriers to achieving very high power/torque densities, while meeting Navy performance requirements.  ONR is interested in system solutions that result in low weight for the overall electric drive system. 
The intended award for this Broad Agency Announcement will include multiple phases. Offerors should propose phases which have meaningful decision points approximately yearly. The decision points should be based on milestones and deliverables, ideally with associated measurable achievements. The program will conclude with delivery of a motor, associated motor controller, transformer/switchgear, and controls and any ancillary equipment needed to test the motor at a U.S. Navy facility to be determined at a later date.  For purposes of this BAA, it is assumed that the power interface at the Navy facility will be 2000VDC with up to a 36.5MW capacity.

It is the intent and objective of the Government to obtain services for the demolition and removal of Buildings 25 and 28 located at Naval Station, Great Lakes, Illinois.  The buildings include, but are not limited to brick and CMU block and concrete structure with wood windows, basement, breezeways, sewer and water lines, electrical equipment, and heating units.  The buildings are approximately 72,916 square feet each of concrete block and structure, with wood windows and basement.  The base award will be Building 25 with an estimated performance period of 120 days.  An option for Building 28 will be dependent upon availability of funds with an estimated period of performance for 90 days.  Estimated completion date is April 28, 2005.  The buildings are heavily contaminated with lead and asbestos and other hazardous materials.  A comprehensive environmental survey will be released as part of the RFP.  The abandoned buildings are deteriorated and pose safety hazards.  Both are located on Farragut Avenue, West of Ross Field and were built in 1906 as main training dormitories.  These buildings are located close to the main gate and pose a safety hazard due to falling terra cotta pieces.    The work includes all labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision required for complete demolition of Buildings 25 and 28. This work will include removal of hazardous materials, floor slabs, full depth foundations, portion of exterior pavement, sidewalks, piping and associated utilities.  Site restoration will include replacing existing utilities, exterior lighting, pavement and sidewalks, backfill, compaction and landscaping and associated works.  

The solicitation for the acquisition of this demolition project will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with Far 15.1 FOR A COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATED PROCUREMENT UTILIZING the one-step source selection method.   This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides best value to the Government.  The offers may be evaluated on the following technical factors:  Factor A—Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience; and Factor B – Technical Requirements which includes Project Organization, Quality Control and Safety and Health, and Asbestos Abatement.  Any joint ventures with 8(a) members will have to comply with CFR Title 13, Section 124.513.  Firms are expected to participate in any pre-proposal conferences to be announced at a later date.  

Offers WILL NOT be publicly opened.  The number of offers received, the identity of offers received, the amount of any offer or relative standing of the offers WILL NOT be disclosed to anyone until time of contract award.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for documents.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.   A pre-proposal conference will be scheduled and indicated in the RFP.

<DESC>Title:  Marine Mammal and Marine Ecosystem Conservation

Purpose:  The U.S. Marine Mammal Commission is seeking pre-proposals for research and related activities that will further the conservation and management goals of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.  The intent is to support focused efforts that will supplement rather than supplant the research efforts of other agencies and organizations.  

The evaluation process will occur in two steps.  The first step will involve submission and evaluation of pre-proposals.  The second will involve submission and evaluation of full proposals only from investigators who have been notified that their pre-proposals have been accepted.  In the recent past, the Commission has provided support for approximately 50 percent of the proposals received.  That percent may decline in 2004, depending on the number of proposals submitted and the availability of funding.  Past projects supported by the Commission generally have ranged from $5,000 to $40,000.  Proposals can budget for more than one year of work, but support will be provided on a yearly basis and cannot be guaranteed for more than a single year.  Recipients of funding are welcome to submit additional proposals for funding in subsequent years.  The Commission reserves the right to award a limited number of contracts, to limit the awards to a certain number of subject areas, and to limit the dollar amount of any award.  Contractors whose projects involve the taking of marine mammals will be expected to obtain all necessary permits and authorizations for their projects before engaging in such activities.

Commission priorities, selection criteria, formats for pre- and full proposals, the submission process, and the submission schedule are described below.  
											
Priorities:  The Commission will consider proposals that address diverse issues relevant to marine mammals and associated marine ecosystem research and conservation.  The Commission will give priority to projects that address the following general subject areas:

•	The ecology of killer whales in the North Pacific Ocean and, in particular, the potential impact of killer whale predation on endangered marine mammal species or stocks;
•	The efficacy of research, management, and recovery efforts for endangered, threatened, and depleted species;
•	Methods for predicting, monitoring, and mitigating human activities that adversely affect marine mammals or their habitat;
•	Detection of important conservation issues for marine mammals, including identification or clarification of units of conservation (e.g., species subspecies, stocks); and
•	Methods for minimizing potentially harmful direct interactions between human activities and growing or recovering marine mammal populations.
	
Pre-proposal selection criteria:  Pre-proposals will be evaluated by members of the Marine Mammal Commission staff and a subcommittee of the Commission’s Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals.  The following factors will be considered in reviewing pre-proposals:

•	Likelihood of furthering important conservation purposes under the Marine Mammal Protection Act;
•	General reasonableness of expected costs;
•	Whether proposed projects are pertinent to key conservation efforts or will lead to new perspectives on means to achieve the goals of the Marine Mammal Protection Act;
•	Past success on similar projects conducted by the principal investigators; and
•	Completeness of the pre-proposal.
	
Pre-proposal format:  Pre-proposals are limited to two pages in normal font (12 point).  Each pre-proposal should include the following:

•	Title of project;
•	Names of applicant(s) and likely co-investigators;
•	Description of conservation problem or issue being addressed;
•	General approach to be used;
•	Expected products;
•	Expected cost and time frame; and
•	Funding in hand or being sought elsewhere, if applicable.

Investigators will be notified by e-mail as to whether their pre-proposal has been accepted.  Investigators whose pre-proposals have been accepted will be invited to submit a full proposal.

Selection criteria for full proposals:  Full proposals should be submitted only after an investigator has been notified that his or her pre-proposal has been accepted.  These proposals will be evaluated using the normal consultative process of the Marine Mammal Commission with its Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals and Commission staff.  The following factors will be considered in reviewing full proposals:

•	Likelihood of furthering important conservation purposes under the Marine Mammal Protection Act;
•	Adequacy of scientific design for achieving study objectives;
•	Reasonableness of expected costs relative to study design and objectives;
•	Whether and to what extent proposed projects will provide key information for conservation efforts or lead to new perspectives on means to achieve the goals of the Marine Mammal Protection Act;
•	Past success on similar projects conducted by the principal investigators; and
•	Completeness of the proposal.

Full proposal format:

Investigators who are invited to submit a full proposal should use the following format.  Full proposals will be limited to a maximum of 10 pages.

	Abstract—Provide an abstract of the proposal summarizing the problem or question to be addressed, the method to be  used to address the problem or question, possible outcomes of the work, and the utility of the research for advancing science and management related to marine mammals.  Please limit the abstract to approximately 200 words.

	Introduction, Background, or Problem Statement—Provide a brief description of the issue or problem to be addressed.  What is the problem and why is the research important?

	Goals and Objectives—Provide a statement of the general or broad goal of the proposed research and specific objectives that will be addressed to achieve that goal.

	Methods—Provide a detailed description of the methods of the investigation so that the reviewer can understand how you will address each of the specific objectives.  If you are testing a null hypothesis, describe the power of your method to detect a significant alternative hypothesis.  If your work is largely descriptive, provide a perspective on the completeness of your study in terms of providing a full description of the activity or behavior being described.  For example, if you are studying movement patterns using satellite-linked telemetry, describe the completeness of your study in terms of potential sources of variation in those movement patterns (e.g., site of origin, year, season, size/age/sex class).

	Possible Outcomes—Describe the outcomes that you think are possible or likely.

	Research and Management Implications—Describe the implications of the various outcomes for further research or management of your subject species or, if appropriate, other species, the ecosystem, etc.

	Project Evaluation—Describe how you will assess the success of your study.

	Products—Describe the anticipated products of your study (papers, talks, guidelines, etc.)

	Budget and Time Line—Describe your budget and time line, providing sufficient detail so that the reviewer is informed of expenses or costs by general category (salary, equipment, supplies, travel, publication, overhead, miscellaneous).  Include information on other sources of funding for the project, if applicable.  

	Research Team Qualifications—Provide a brief description (i.e., paragraph) of the principal investigators for the project, including their experience or expertise related to the subject proposal.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 514210 General Information 	Document Type	Sources Sought Notice 	Solicitation Number	PR-DC-04-02333 	Posted Date	May 20, 2005 	Original Response Date	June 18, 2005 	Current Response Date	June 18, 2005 	Classification Code		D- IT Services 	NAICS Code		514210 Contracting Office  Address 	Environmental Protection Agency, e-Rulemaking Program Management Office.  Description 	EPA is conducting market research for the requirement described herein.  This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).   This is not a formal solicitation or a request for proposals.  This RFI is for  information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The eRulemaking Program Management Office (PMO) is seeking to determine if Federal Agencies and/or companies are interested in providing production hosting services for the eRulemaking Initiative's  Federal Docket Management System (FDMS).  This hosting service will consist of facilities and supporting information technology, staff and management infrastructure needed to support the FDMS.  See Section 1.3 below, and corresponding sections, regarding limitations on submissions.  A complete copy  of this RFI can be found at http://www.eepa.gov/oam/hpod under the sources sought section. 1.	INTRODUCTION This request identifies a spectrum of services  that agencies and/or companies could furnish to host the FDMS in the context of a highly fault-tolerant service agreement-based environment.  The hosting services being considered span a continuum from "Basic Hosting Services" to "Comprehensive Hosting Services": ?	Basic Hosting Services - Provide only basic computing, communications, and security infrastructure and operational support to enable Federal agency or contractor personnel to  procure, install, and operate FDMS systems within the host's facility.  ?	Comprehensive Hosting Services - May include, but is not limited to, providing all computing servers/services (production, development, and test), management, monitoring, and administration; help desk; license management,  performance, availability, compliance and policy monitoring and event reporting; physical and application security, backup and redundancy support; intrusion and virus prevention and detection; hardware and software upgrades and enhancements. The final level of FDMS hosting service selected (if any)  on this "basic" to "comprehensive" continuum will be determined through a cost and benefit analysis to be conducted at a later stage. 1.1	Scope The eRulemaking Initiative is divided into distinct modules that focus on transformation of the current federal regulatory development, docket, and  comment process. Ultimately, the Initiative will provide a single Web-based electronic access point to all Federal dockets, facilitating the public comment submission and management process, docket content management, and regulatory content development. A Federal or private provider with a  significant track record of exemplary service will host the FDMS. An environment that provides high performance and availability, a high degree of scalability, leading physical and network security, best practice monitoring and reporting, and application management is required. The PMO recognizes  that some services, such as staffing trained personnel capable of installing FDMS software, may be potential capabilities of the provider rather than existing capabilities. 1.2	Objectives Obtain information that will lead to the identification of providers for FDMS hosting through a Survey of  Hosting Service Provider Capabilities. The structure of the survey focuses on gathering information concerning the candidates' ability and experience in delivering hosting services, ranging from "Basic Hosting Services" to "Comprehensive Hosting Services" as described in the Introduction.  Candidates need not offer all elements of "Comprehensive" to be considered a viable candidate. Hosting services under consideration will include both commercial hosting services and Federal agencies.  The Comprehensive Hosting Service provider will maintain all aspects of the physical FDMS  production, development, and testing environments with the exception of software development items. Software will be forwarded to the provider for installation following unit, system, user, and integration testing (as applicable) in the development and testing environments. The following services  are expected for the "Comprehensive" option: 1.	Procurement, upgrade, and management of all computing, application, and telecommunication systems required to meet performance, reliability, availability, and data integrity requirements of the Production FDMS. 2.	Full asset lifecycle management  (hardware systems, software licenses).  3.	Full range of production, test, and development server operations and management. 4.	Infrastructure, production application service environment monitoring, and administration. 5.	Management and administration of testing and development  environment. 6.	Backup and restore services. 7.	Business continuity/disaster recovery services (major subsystem failures and loss of facility). 8.	Physical, procedural and logical (electronic) security assurance/partitioning - facility, communication system, applications; data by programs/projects,  sensitivity, and function (production, test, development).  9.	Effective partitioning of FDMS production, test and development system and other host system (physically or logically) to ensure a secure, stable, high performance, and user access/information exchange. 10.	Massive storage scalability,  including high speed central data stores.  11.	High performance scalable internal and external telecommunications to support optimal FDMS operation and citizen/agency access and information exchange. 12.	Monitoring and reporting - event reporting, Service Level Agreement (SLA)  compliance/performance (application performance, availability, policy/procedure compliance).  13.	End-to-end problem detection through problem resolution. 14.	Help desk services. 15.	Hosting vendor compensation methods - proven cost recovery methods and support for performance-based  compensation. 1.3	Submission Requirements This survey is intended to determine the current market capabilities and capacities associated with these services. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made  for any costs associated with information provided in response to this announcement and any follow-up requests.

In responding to the  following service components, please describe how the delivery of such services relate to industry best practices.  The respondent is free to expand their discussion on any area as they feel appropriate.    Specific services are to be discussed in the order listed: 1.	Procurement, upgrade, and  management of all computing, application, and telecommunication systems required to meet performance, reliability, availability, and data integrity requirements of the Production FDMS A variety of approaches to provide these services is possible. Examples of alternatives are shown below the  responder is not limited to only these alternatives. Please characterize the range of alternatives you support and your approach to delivering these services to your clients.  The core service is to provide basic Information Technology infrastructure (internal and external communications, power,  heating/ventilating/air conditioning (HVAC), physical and electronic security) with a variety of approaches to hosting applications on that infrastructure.   In this section the term customer refers to the Government and/or another entity designated by the Government.  For  example: ?	Customer-specific hardware/software (HW/SW) owned, installed, and operated by the customer on your infrastructure. ?	Customer specific HW/SW owned, installed and operated by customer with simple and emergency maintenance (e.g., tape back-up pulls, hard drive/power supply swaps) handled  by host staff. ?	Customer-specific HW/SW owned by the customer but installed and operated by host staff. ?	Customer-specific HW/SW purchased as needed when the hosting agency determines it is required to support service and performance agreements (owned and managed by the hosting agency).  ?	Host  agency allocates existing HW/SW resources from existing operations and expands these resources as needed to support agreed-upon service and performance commitments to the customer. All HW/SW is owned by the hosting agency and may be shared, used, or both by multiple customers.  Briefly describe  your internal and external communications, computing and storage capabilities; and your ability to scale these capabilities on demand. Indicate which platforms you are staffed and provisioned to support (hardware and operating systems).  Full asset lifecycle management (hardware systems, software  licenses)  A variety of approaches to provide these services is possible. Examples of alternatives are shown below the responder is not limited to only these alternatives. Please characterize the range of alternatives you support and your approach to delivering these services to your  clients. ?	Asset management and system upgrades/ maintenance planning is the customers' responsibility. ?	Asset management and system upgrades are managed and recommendations for system enhancements are made based on total cost of ownership, best practices, and the systems' current and projected  ability to satisfy service and performance agreements. ?	Customer procures systems based on hosting service recommendation.  ?	Hosting service procurement(s) are based on project need; costs are recovered through agreed-upon methods. ?	Hosting service procurements are based on all clients served by  the facility; portions of the cost are recovered from each customer according to SLA.  Do you apply any particular tools, methods, or processes to aid in decision-making and execution management of the integration and retirement process? Are any performance and asset management tools used to aid  in this process?  2.	Full range of production, test, and development server operations and management  A variety of approaches to provide these services is possible. Examples of alternatives are shown below the responder is not limited to only these alternatives. Please characterize the range of  alternatives you support and your approach to delivering these services to your clients.  ?	Provide office space and client access to perform operations and management tasks for FDMS production, test and development systems. ?	Provide office space for client and share operations and management  functions with the customer, but under hosting service policies and procedures. Frequently, Hosting Service providers place more stringent controls on production systems than test and development.  ?	Operation and management of all systems housed within the hosting facility are performed by the  hosting service. Client requests installation of tested production application software on production servers. The hosting service staff installs and configures all systems. Test and development systems are typically supported on separate client facilities or on isolated test and development  environment. When a client identifies new applications, system upgrades/code modules, or hardware, what processes are required to certify its operation within production, test, and development environments and deploy it within the hosting environment? What transition time frames are typically  involved? Are there specific restrictions associated with products that can be operated within the hosting environment (products, operating system, currency of application and operating system, communication protocols supported, etc.)? What hours of operation are staffed with application system  support personnel? What hours will the client have access to the facility? Are you structured to support 24/7 operations?  If so, what types of operations (back-up, restore, recovery, continuity; security storage scalability; telecom; monitoring and reporting; problem detection; help desk services)  and to what degree are they supported (to what degree can they be scaled on demand)?   3.	Infrastructure, production application service environment monitoring, and administration A variety of approaches to provide these services is possible. Examples of alternatives are shown below. The  responder is not limited to only these approaches.  Please characterize the range of alternatives you support and your approach to delivering these services to your clients. ?	Hosting service focus on infrastructure operations and security with customer: o	Allowed to operate their own application  monitoring functions/tools. o	Able to use host monitoring tools to monitor & administer.  ?	Host service is the only entity allowed to use monitoring equipment within the hosting facility. User access is through: o	Standard interfaces. o	Standard message and information exchange between host and  customer systems. o	Other alternatives. ?	Hosting service has no formal structure and application focus, but provides customer access to host tools to monitor and administer their own application. ?	Host agency monitors infrastructure, but no application-specific monitoring beyond active network  connects is performed. 4.	Testing and development environment management and administration ?	What management, administration approaches, customer access, and controls are provided for development and test environments? ?	What facilities are available? ?	What type of separation of test and  development from production is provided? 6.	Backup and restore services  Please describe your approach to providing this service offering, in relation to industry best practices.  7.	Business continuity/disaster recovery services  ?

<DESC>Negotiations are being conducted on a sole source basis with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Unit of Radiation and Cancer for a technical report of  the scientific link between radiation exposure and occurrence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

BACKGROUND INFORMATION/PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) received a mandate from the U.S. Congress in fiscal year 2004 appropriations legislation to “conduct epidemiological research and other activities to establish the scientific link between radiation exposure and the occurrence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.”  Studies of workers exposed to ionizing radiation are a highly relevant potential source of information regarding the radiation-associated risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  The Multi-National Nuclear Worker Epidemiologic Study, recently completed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), includes analysis of leukemia radiogenicity that, with further work, could provide risk estimates for CLL relation to external radiation exposures.  This requirement requests that the contractor complete this analysis and provide results to NIOSH in a technical report by October 31, 2004.

CLL is strongly associated with attained age and has a number of sub-types.  There is some evidence that its etiology is similar to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and that it may be associated with herbicide exposure (Institute of Medicine 2003, pp 372-375).  To date, epidemiologic studies that evaluated the relation between ionizing radiation and CLL have not shown a positive association, as summarized below.  As a result several formal committees have concluded that CLL is not radiogenic, or have declined  to estimate radiation-related risk for CLL (NRPB 2002, UNSCEAR 2000, NAS/NRC 1990).  

CLL risk as a result of external radiation exposures has not been observed in the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors (Preston et al 1994).   However, the incidence of this disease is much lower in many Asian populations than in North America and Europe.  Several important studies have been conducted among Western populations, including those exposed to relatively high doses during medical procedures.  No association of radiation exposure with CLL was observed among 14,000 U.K. ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with x-rays, although only a very small number of CLL deaths occurred in this population (a total of 2 CLL deaths; Darby et al. 1987).   No elevation of CLL risk has been observed among U.S., Canadian and European women exposed to radiation during treatment for uterine cancer (a total of 57 CLL deaths; Curtis et al. 1994).

The acute exposure profiles for the atomic bomb survivors and medically exposed cohorts are quite different, however, from that seen in occupational environments, and the reliability of extrapolation from one to the other is uncertain.  Among nuclear workers, no significant relationship between occupational exposure to radiation and CLL has been observed in a U.K. study of over 124,000 workers (a total of 26 deaths, Muirhead et al. 1999).  No relationship was observed between external radiation dose and CLL in the first combined international nuclear workers study (a total of 27 CLL deaths; Cardis et al 1995).

Few published studies of U.S. Department of Energy workers have explicitly evaluated the association between internal radiation and CLL.  A study of over 14,000 plutonium workers at Sellafield in the UK identified just three fatal cases of CLL, only one of which occurred among workers with quantitative dose estimates, and risks were not explicitly estimated (Omar et al. 1999).  At least one study was conducted among medically-exposed populations.  No increased risk was found for CLL among patients in Denmark exposed to Thorotrast, a 232Th-containing contrast medium (Andersson et al. 1993, IARC 2001).                                                                                                       

Still, there remains a need to better estimate risk of CLL associated with radiation exposure.  CLL is currently considered a non-radiogenic cancer under DHHS regulations (42 CFR part 81.30) for determining the probability of causation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000.  CLL is the only cancer for which the Department of Labor assigns a probability of causation of zero.  This has raised concerns among some workers and their representatives about the treatment of this cancer compared to others not shown to be radiogenic (e.g., prostate, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, malignant melanoma).  These others have risk estimates in the NIOSH Interactive RadioEpidemiological Program (IREP), which is used for calculating probabilities of causation under EEOICPA.  Few studies have quantitatively estimated risk for CLL and it currently is not possible to develop a quantitative model that might provide the basis for modifications to the NIOSH-IREP.  As CLL is not rapidly fatal like many other leukemia subtypes, it is important to including non-underlying causes of death when evaluating CLL risk.  

STATEMENT OF WORK:
Using the work history, demographic and exposure data previously compiled for the Combined International Nuclear Worker Study, estimate the relative risk (RR) and excess relative risks (ERR) per unit dose for (1) all leukemia; (2) all leukemia except CLL; and (3) CLL alone, using Poisson regression with the cohorts in the Combined International Nuclear Worker Study, evaluating risk for all cohorts together and the U.S. cohorts separately.  The U.S. cohorts should include Hanford, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  All analyses will utilize both underlying and non-underlying causes of death. The analysis method should follow the general methods outlined in the Procedures Documents guiding the work of the Combined International Nuclear Worker Study.  The emphasis of the analyses will be to estimate the RR and ERR for these groups and outcomes, with profile likelihood-based 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals reported where possible.  To the extent that the data will allow, risk estimates should also incorporate dose estimate uncertainties.  

DELIVERABLES:
Technical report that summarizes the methods used, gives results of the analyses and provides an interpretation of results is due on October 31, 2004.  Progress reports will be due on the first Monday of each month between award of contract and submission of the technical report (e.g., August 1, September 1, October 1).   Report will be e-mailed to the NIOSH Project Officer. 

CAPABILITIES REQUIREMENTS:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Interested firms may visit the site on their own during the appropriate hours listed. No accompanied site visits will be entertained. The anticipated scope of work consists of the following components.  (a.) Develop an interpretive master p lan for the Cordova Center, including the development of interpretive themes and messages that are fundamental to the project.  (b.) From the interpretive master plan, develop a conceptual interpretive exhibit plan, integrating exhibits with the learning c enter, amphitheater, trails, and other significant site elements.  (c.)

The proposed center will combine several components into a regional destination for experiencing and understanding our natural environment.  The central theme will be one of relationships between human need and natural resources at Lake Red Rock and wi thin the Des Moines River Watershed.  The goal of this project is to educate the public on environmental stewardship, and build support for conservation of IowaÃ¢Â€Â™s land and water resources. In addition, the Center will provide a stage for live performa nces and programming that will augment the publicÃ¢Â€Â™s interaction with both nature and culture.  A new trailhead will serve to integrate the existing multi-purpose Volksweg Trail with the new facility.

<DESC>This announcement does not request any proposals at this time.  The following topic is an anticipated requirement for Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate (AFRL/SN).  A solicitation amendment requesting proposals against this topic is anticipated to be published in August 2004.  The objective of the Advanced Threat Alert (ATA) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) is to develop an affordable warning, situational awareness (SA), radio frequency (RF) targeting, electronic intelligence (ELINT), and self protection (SP) electronic support measure (ESM) system capable of operating in a network centric environment.  The technologies will increase the survivability and attack capability of the combat aircraft/unmanned air vehicle (UAV) in a complex signal environment consisting of low probability of intercept (LPI), multi-function radars, and communication signals.  The evolution of the RF environment necessitates enhanced intercept, detection, identification (type and Specific Emitter ID (SEI)), and location capabilities for ESM systems.  Emphasis will be placed on the small, low cost, stable, highly reliable, and easily maintainable RF receiver.   Warfighter requirements dictate the receiver be dynamically reprogrammable and real-time for new threats.  The receiver will also require optimized techniques for every platform according to mission type and stage of mission in order to maximize airspace buyback.  The modular approach to retrofit receivers will permit the utilization of the core receiver design on tactical, strategic, transport, and theater assets with minimal development and production costs.  Ultimately the receiver will form the baseline for all future digital radar warning and targeting receivers for existing and future aircraft and UAV’s, and become the heart of an advanced digital EW countermeasure system.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA  amendment by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.fbo.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

On June 30, 2006, the Food and Drug Administration will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1906 Food and Drugs Act, legislation that established our nation's oldest federal consumer protection agency.  The agency wants to celebrate this historic milestone by promoting activities throughout the nation.  
 
In 2002, the agency contracted with a public relations firm to develop a theme and plan for commemorating FDA's 100th anniversary.  The theme is PROTECTING AND ADVANCING AMERICA’S HEALTH.  FDA envisions the implementation of a national public education program to recognize the scientific advances that have led to the safety and effectiveness of FDA regulated products.  As a result of this effort, the public consciousness of the FDA should be heightened so that both the consumer and policymakers see the agency as a pioneer and leader in the field of health protection and emerging scientific advances as we seek to recruit young scientists. 
 
The objective of this contract is to use a public relations firm to develop and implement in the next year a plan to use the media as the channel for educating and informing FDA's constituents and implement it over the three-year timeframe culminating with the 2006 centennial commemoration.   
 

 THE GOALS FOR THE FDA CENTENNIAL ARE AS FOLLOWS:
 
Goal -1     Use broadcast and other media to observe and celebrate FDA's first 100 years of contributions to America's public health and the world community and further FDA's mission to promote and protect the public health for future generations.
 
Goal -2     Use broadcast and other media to commemorate contributions of dedicated FDA employees, legislators, academicians, industry, advocacy groups and public health leaders who have supported the consumer protection mission of the Agency.
 
Goal -3     Use broadcast and other media to broaden public awareness of the considerable breath of the FDA's authorities and programs and instill a fuller appreciation of the Agency's impact on the public health and safety of our Nation.
 
Goal -4     Use broadcast and other me

The plan must be presented in writing. This plan will be reviewed through the FDA Office of External Relations and approved prior to implementation of the tasks specified in this contract.
Task -3.2  The plan should include specific activities to be carried-out throughout the three-year timetable culminating in the 2006 centennial year.  The plan must include all FDA centers and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (headquarters and field).  For example, a list of inventive elements such as televised town hall meetings, a Smithsonian lecture/exhibit/traveling exhibit, or the development of high school and college curriculum.

Task -3.4   The media plan will need to communicate with all levels of FDAs constituents by translating complex themes to messages that are direct and easily understood.  These messages should speak to consumers about issues that affect their lives and offer strong visual and human interest components using real life examples whenever feasible.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for preparing a telecom development policy for the Republic of Montenegro.

The Government of the Republic of Montenegro (GOM), which is one of the two states within the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, has responsibility for telecom sector policy and regulations within its borders.  In the legal/regulatory area, Montenegro has had its own Law on Telecommunications since 2000.  The law prescribes the basic responsibilities for sector oversight on the part of the Ministry of Economy (MOE) of the GOM and established an independent regulatory body, the Telecommunications Agency of Montenegro.  

The proposed Technical Assistance will assist the MOE in carrying out one of its major responsibilities under the Law on Telecommunications, namely preparation of a telecommunications sector development plan; submission of this plan to the GOM; and oversight of the implementation of the plan once ratified.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $306,711 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 pm, June 8, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<RESPDATE>062804
<ARCHDATE>08272004
<CONTACT>Sarah Mehlenbeck, (719)526-6624
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the due date for proposals from 27 May 2004 to NLT 10:00 28 June 2004 and to answer questions. Question: I wanted to clarify a question in the RFQ. When you're asking that the firm's geographic proximity to Fort Carson, Colorado be within two hours away, could this refer to two hours by plane? Answer: The two hours referred to is via car. Question: The announcement indicates that a Certified Industrial Hygienist is required for the project team. Will the CIH duties be related to asbestos and indoor air quality, or to exposure assessments or to HVAC issues? Answer: The Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) is intended to advise the AE on asbestos and lead type issues. Many of those are under DECAM's purview but an AE needs the insight in a potential design to know what is or may be required during onsite const ruction/renovation. The AE would have to detail the needed requirements in the construction whereas the construction contractor would have to enact the particulars of the needed action. The Certified Industrial Hygienist will need to have a wide-variety of  experiences.  Question: Do you want SF 254 AND SF 255 from the consultants?  Answer: An SF 254 is required for each consultant and the prime. The prime fills out the SF 255 for the entire team.  Please direct any questions to sarah.mehlenbeck@carson.army.mil.

A written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-18.  The Food and Drug Administration, Office of the Commissioner, OER-IO intends to award a purchase order to use a public relations firm to develop and implement a plan for using the media to educate and inform FDAs constituents for the 2006 Centennial Commemoration.   Contract line items include the following: Item 1 – Develop a plan for commemorating the FDA centennial through broadcast and other media over a three year time span from 2004-2006 in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.1;  Item 2 - Develop the media project ideas and implementation ideas for constituents in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.2;  Item 3 -Define roles and responsibilities for implementation in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.3;   Item 4 - Use the media to achieve broad constituent recognition of the FDA’s vital role in protecting and promoting the health and safety of the public in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.4.   

1.  Objective
 
On June 30, 2006, the Food and Drug Administration will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1906 Food and Drugs Act, legislation that established our nation's oldest federal consumer protection agency.  The agency wants to celebrate this historic milestone by promoting activities throughout the nation.  
 
In 2002, the agency contracted with a public relations firm to develop a theme and plan for commemorating FDA's 100th anniversary.  The theme is PROTECTING AND ADVANCING AMERICA’S HEALTH.  FDA envisions the implementation of a national public education program to recognize the scientific advances that have led to the safety and effectiveness of FDA regulated products.  As a result of this effort, the public consciousness of the FDA should be heightened so that both the consumer and policymakers see the agency as a pioneer and leader in the field of health protection and emerging scientific advances as we seek to recruit young scientists. 
 
The objective of this contract is to use a public relations firm to develop and implement, in the next year, a plan to use the media as the channel for educating and informing FDA's constituents over a three-year timeframe culminating with the 2006 centennial commemoration.   
 
2.  Goals
 The goals for the FDA Centennial are as follows:
 
Goal 1     Use broadcast and other media to observe and celebrate FDA's first 100 years of contributions to America's public health and the world community and further FDA's mission to promote and protect the public health for future generations.
 
Goal 2     Use broadcast and other media to commemorate contributions of dedicated FDA employees, legislators, academicians, industry, advocacy groups and public health leaders who have supported the consumer protection mission of the Agency.
 
Goal 3     Use broadcast and other media to broaden public awareness of the considerable breath of the FDA's authorities and programs and instill a fuller appreciation of the Agency's impact on the public health and safety of our Nation.
 
Goal 4     Use broadcast and other media to stimulate interest and increase awareness of FDA regulatory science and public health through education.

 
3.  Specific Tasks

3. 1. Develop a media plan and timetable for commemorating FDA's 100th anniversary of the 1906 
Food and Drugs Act.  The media messages will convey the importance of FDA in consumer's lives and how the FDA plays a role in 25 cents of every dollar consumers spend. 

The plan must be presented in writing. This plan will be reviewed through the FDA Office of External Relations and approved prior to implementation of the tasks specified in the contract.

3. 2. The plan should include specific activities to be carried-out throughout the three-year timetable culminating in the 2006 centennial year.  The plan must include all FDA centers and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (headquarters and field).  For example, a list of inventive elements such as televised town hall meetings, a Smithsonian lecture/exhibit/traveling exhibit, or the development of high school and college curriculum. 
Develop a strategy for extending FDA coverage through the media partnerships that will be mutually beneficial to the news organization and the FDA.  Partnerships may include, but is not limited to, business and industry, academia, consumer organizations, health professional associations, disease oriented advocacy groups, and faith-based and community-based programs.  Examples of activities may include  FDA information in regular programming, periodic special programming with commentary from the Commissioner or other senior FDA officials, and/or weekly specials to highlight FDA issues that affects its constituents, website recognition of FDA's centennial, exhibits at meetings, and development of educational modules for school use.
3.3.  Define the roles and responsibilities and the parts they will play throughout the three-years of celebration for the Commissioner, Center Directors, field staff and FDA Alumni Association members as well as involvement at the Department level and perhaps Cabinet level. 
3.4.   The media plan will need to communicate with all levels of FDAs constituents by translating complex themes to messages that are direct and easily understood.  These messages should speak to consumers about issues that affect their lives and offer strong visual and human interest components using real life examples whenever feasible.  The messages must cover a broad spectrum of constituents such as other governmental and public health entities, national institutions such as the Smithsonian Institute and the National Academy of Sciences, and media such as television (PBS), radio (NPR) and print (newspapers and magazines) to promote the centennial. 
As part of this effort, it will be important to have performance goals and measurements to be able to document the increase in constituent recognition and knowledge of FDA and its mission and accomplishments.

<SUBJECT>A -- DESIGN AND SIZING OF FALL PROTECTION HARNESSES
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-DSR-04-04
<RESPDATE>061704
<ARCHDATE>07022004
<CONTACT>Brenda Goodwin, Contract Specialist, Phone (304)285-5882, Fax (304)285-6083, Email bcg1@cdc.gov - Brenda Goodwin, Contract Specialist, Phone (304)285-5882, Fax (304)285-6083, Email bcg1@cdc.gov
<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is seeking to sign a Letter of Agreement (LOA) to work with a harness manufacturer to design and test a harness sizing scheme based on the NIOSH newly collected 3-dimensional human torso shape and size information.  The goal of this project is to develop an improved harness sizing system that would accommodate the national occupational populations, and thus would enhance the ability of workers to select, fit, and use harnesses safely.  This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner selected will share expertise with NIOSH researchers toward transferring the NIOSH anthropometric data and harness-sizing research results into an improved and profitable safety product.  

Falls are one of the two leading causes of death and injury in the workplace.  Each year, 313,000 American workers are disabled in work-related falls; and more than 700 work-related fatalities result from falls.  Beyond the human tragedy, falls represent a major cost to U.S. businesses and industry.  About 3.7 billion dollars are paid out each year in workers' compensation; and the losses in productivity, labor, and medical expenses can be estimated at $9.4 billion from National Safety Council's data.  Fall protective harnesses are undergoing a dramatic increase in use as the last line of defense in areas where fall hazards cannot be completely eliminated.  Human body dimensions have changed over the last decades.  Diverse workforces in the industries, as well as new roles for women in the workforce, make it likely that more occupations will show a greater variation in their range of body dimensions.  Incompatible harnesses, if worn by workers, are not likely to provide the level of protection and comfort the person requires to work productively.  The harness manufacturing industry has a pressing need for an assessment of fit and function of these products.  Updated anthropometry databases in 3-dimensional (3-D) format are in need for studying these human-harness-interface issues.  They help to formulate harness sizing schemes and to design adequate harnesses for various populations, to provide the required level of protection, productivity, and comfort.

NIOSH has completed two laboratory studies that identified harness sizing criteria and is finalizing a 3-dimensional torso shape-and-size quantification method to define an effective harness sizing scheme for harness design.  NIOSH wishes to solicit input from industry partners on (1) formalizing harness redesign procedures; (2) completing a sizing scheme for whole-body fall harnesses that includes an anthropometric guide for harness designers, a guide defining how manufacturers should report sizing, and a guide to assist end users in the selection of an appropriately sized harness; (3) completing the ideas and drawings for an improved harness system; (4) completing the prototypes of a new harness system; and (6) completing a study protocol to evaluate the new design.

Candidate companies which appear to possess the greatest capacity to meet the requirements listed in the Collaborative Capabilities Parameters below, will be evaluated based on their capability to successfully perform the following tasks: (1) Provide the dimensions that the manufacturer used or needs in designing a harness, (2) Provide the manufacturer’s current sizing schemes, (3) Complete a new design of an improved harness system based on the NIOSH data and new sizing scheme, and (4) Work with NIOSH to complete the evaluation of a new design and further modify the new design as needed.  This announcement does not obligate NIOSH to sign an LOA with any presented company.  NIOSH reserves the right to establish a partnership based on engineering and design capabilities and business commitment found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the Government. 

Collaborative Capabilities Parameters:  (Companies should try to meet as many of these requirements as possible, but highly innovative solutions without testing are not discouraged from presentation or response.) 

(A) Providing significant technical expertise in designing and manufacturing fall protection harnesses.  –Required;

(B) Fabricating harness prototypes for test and evaluation - Required; 

(C) Providing expertise to NIOSH in designing and conducting laboratory evaluations of harnesses - Required; 

(D) Reviewing testing methods and recommending appropriate, new testing criteria - Required; 

(E) Reviewing test results and recommending design modifications - Required;

(F) Working with standard organizations to provide NIOSH input so that the new anthropometric information can be fully utilized to benefit our workforce. 

NIOSH is seeking an innovative partner to work on harness-sizing-system enhancement.  A company that is qualified and currently manufacturing, designing, or fabricating fall protection harnesses is highly desired.  However, past testing and design of harnesses is not required.  Interested parties responding to this request should provide detailed information regarding capabilities.

<DESC>The Navy seeks to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regard to privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, “Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.”  The Navy Research Laboratory, Washington D.C. and Navy Research Laboratory, Chesapeake Beach Detachment are seeking interest and information specifically for the privatization of water distribution, wastewater collection, and electric distribution and generation utility systems.  The resulting privatization will include assumption of ownership, operation, and maintenance, and obligation to continue the service for a period of up to 50 years.
Should privatization result, the ownership of the entire utility plant and/or distribution system, including all operating responsibility shall transfer to a regional or municipal utility or to a private company.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower, and overhead costs shall become the utility provider’s responsibility.  It is intended that privatization will reduce the Navy’s life cycle costs. 
The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size and general description of the system.  Any numbers may only be estimates for this purpose.

Navy Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C.
 
WATER SYSTEM: The system consists of approximately 50,000 linear feet of mostly cast iron water distribution mains averaging 8” in diameter.  Much of the system is over 50 years old.  Water pressure averages around 50 PSI.  Water is fed from the 30” District of Columbia water main in Overlook Avenue where a 9.74 MGD capacity exists.  Normal and peak consumption varies from 1.12 MGD to 1.34 MGD.  The system serves both domestic and fire protection requirements.  

WASTEWATER SYSTEM: Sanitary sewerage piping of approximately 24,000 linear feet of gravity sewer lines constructed of both clay and cast iron pipe empties directly into the 2 main DC trunk lines that run to Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment plant next door.  Capacity is therefore basically unlimited.  Normal flow was 848,000 GPD and peak demand was 1,017,000 GPD in 1999.  There are lift stations in Building 149 and Building 256 as well as approximately 18 smaller pumps throughout the facility.  

ELECTRIC SYSTEM: Receives electrical power from two 69KV feeder lines from Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO).  Two PEPCO transformers step the voltage down to 13.8 KV.  The two 13.8 KV feeders are terminated in NRL’s switching station (located in Building 246) on Bus G and Bus H and are tied together by a tiebreaker.  This power is distributed throughout the lab by a system of 7 dual feeders to approximately 70 transformers averaging about 750 KVA each.  The normal steady state load of  14,800 KWH and peak demand of  20,900 KWH does not tax the 54,000 KWH capacity of the system.  Aside from a few small diesel generators, there is no Navy electrical power generation capability at NRL.  All PCB and PCB contaminated transformers have been replaced.  The distribution system is 49,000 linear feet in length.

Navy Research Laboratory , Chesapeake Beach Detachment
 
WATER SYSTEM: All potable water at CBD is supplied by two 200 GPM pumps which pump from two deep wells to a 400,000 gallon elevated water tank which provides 55 to 80 PSI water to the station.  Chlorine is injected just before the water reaches the storage tank.  The 21,000 LF distribution system consists of transit, copper, iron and galvanized pipe varying from ¾ inch to 14 inches in diameter.  The tank has recently been repaired and its cathodic protection system replaced.  System capacity is 288,000 GPD while normal steady state load is now less than 15,000 GPD.

WASTEWATER SYSTEM: The domestic wastewater system at CBD consists of approximately 12,000 linear feet of main and two lift stations running to a 60,000 GPD capacity Navy treatment plant, complete with digester and trickling filter and UV system.  Normal steady state flow is 15,000 GPD.  The plant went through a major upgrade in 1991,additional repairs were done to the digester and trickling tank in 2001,plant is in good condition.  Sludge is transported under permit to Calvert County Barstow Landfill.  

ELECTRICAL SYSTEM: Electrical source is a single Baltimore Gas and Electric Company 34.5 KV overhead line that is transformed by 3,750 KVA transformers, with diesel emergency generator backup, down to 4.16 KV that is distributed by 10  feeders to 34 transformers on site.  The feeders consist of 32,000 linear feet of cable in underground concrete encased duct bank and 600 linear feet of overhead cable.  Normal steady state load is 754 KWH and peak demand is 821 KWH .  All PCB transformers have been replaced.   
This Request for Information (RFI) is required component of a complete and systematic process to evaluate interested parties under the Department of the Navy’s utilities privatization program.  In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with a formal request for proposals (RFP).  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal RFP will be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a Statement of Interest on company letterhead (not to exceed 20 pages in length, printed on one side only, and double-spaced) on or before 9 June 2004.

<SUBJECT>A -- Chemical Optimization and Preclinical Development of HIV-1 Nucleocapsid-p7 Protein-Nucleic Acid Antagonists.
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) - Screening Technologies Branch (STB, in collaboration with the NCI-Retroviral Assembly and Protein Chemistry Laboratories and the AIDS Vaccine Program), have identified several classes of lead compounds which are antagonists of high affinity binding of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid-p7 protein to nucleic acids [e.g. alternating d(TG)n], thereby inhibiting viral replication in HIV-1 infected human CEM SS cells.

One such example is the substituted arylstibonic acid, I which exhibits in vitro activity in a virus disassembly assay, disrupting viral particles formed from in vitro-assembled gag particles. Compound I also exhibits excellent correlation between virus particle disassembly activity and NC-p7 and ^p6- d(TG)4 complex disruption and protects CEM SS cells from cytopathic effects of the HIV-1 virus in whole cell/live virus assays.  The NCI-DTP-STB now seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) collaborator to participate in the preclinical anti-HIV viral development of compound I which possesses a distinct mechanism of action, is relatively non-toxic and has the potential for use in combination with antiviral drugs acting through differing mechanisms of action.

Compound I: see http://ttb.nci.nih.gov/cradaopp39.html   for structure

Potential Areas of Application:  Antiviral (HIV) agent

Main advantages of the technology:  Compound I: a) inhibits viral replication, transmission and promotes viral inactivation; b) is relatively non-toxic; c) is active in whole cell/live virus assays; and, d) has potential for use in combination antiviral therapy.

Current State of Development:  Inhibition binding studies were performed with a fluorescence anisotropy assay. Using surface plasmon resonance technology, a subset of compounds correlated well with the anisotropy results. In vitro evaluation indicated a comparable pattern of antiviral activity.

Further R&D Required:  Development would include optimizing lead compound(s) for activity, potency, formulation, stability, metabolism, toxicity, absorption/distribution etc. Biological testing would be carried out by the NCI-STB, the organizational component of NCI-DTP responsible for the development and operation of in vitro drug screening tools and detailed development and investigation of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of AIDS, opportunistic infections, and AIDS-related malignancies.

For clarification of content, contact Ms. Cecelia Davis, Procurement Analyst, at (202) 219-0202.  

DESCRIPTION:  The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) are posting this notice on FedBizOpps seeking information that will assist in identifiying domestic capabilities and for evaluating whether some articles on the list of nonavailable articles at FAR 25.104(a) are now mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality. 

This notice was also published in the Federal Register on May 18, 2004 (69 FR 28104).  The Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a-10d) generally requires that only domestically mined, produced, or manufactured articles be procured for public use in the United States.  The Buy American Act provides an exception for articles not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality.  FAR 25.103(b)(1) provides a determination that articles listed at FAR 25.104(a) meet the conditions of this exception.  The established list of articles identified in FAR 25.104(a) is a comprehensive and wide-ranging mix of natural resources, compounds, materials, and other items of supply.  

Although some articles on the list have no known domestic production sources (e.g., quartz crystals or vanilla beans), many of the articles are known to have some domestic production sources, but those sources have been determined in the past to be inadequate to meet U.S. demand.  Examples of such articles range from goat and kidskins (negligible domestic production), to crude iodine (5 percent of U.S. Government and nongovernment demand), to bismuth (not in excess of 50 percent of U.S. Government and nongovernment demand).  The list has not been subjected to a thorough review since 1957.  Currently, the procedures for updating articles on the list rely on a contracting officer ’s notice to the Defense Acquisition Regulations (DAR) Council or the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) (in accordance with agency procedures) for possible addition or removal of an article from the list (FAR 25.103(b)(2)(ii) and FAR 25.104(b)).  With constantly changing market conditions, the Councils are seeking information to determine whether some articles should be removed from the list because they are now mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality.  Specific information with regard to domestic production capacity in relation to U.S. Government and nongovernment demand and the quality of domestically-produced items would be most helpful in determining whether articles should remain on or be removed from the list.  

The FAR’s current nonavailable listing is as follows: 
  
Acetylene, black.

DESCRIPTION:  The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) are posting this notice on FedBizOpps seeking information that will assist in identifiying domestic capabilities and for evaluating whether some articles on the list of nonavailable articles at FAR 25.104(a) are now mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality. 

This notice was also published in the Federal Register on May 18, 2004 (69 FR 28104).  The Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a-10d) generally requires that only domestically mined, produced, or manufactured articles be procured for public use in the United States.  The Buy American Act provides an exception for articles not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality.  FAR 25.103(b)(1) provides a determination that articles listed at FAR 25.104(a) meet the conditions of this exception.  The established list of articles identified in FAR 25.104(a) is a comprehensive and wide-ranging mix of natural resources, compounds, materials, and other items of supply.  

Although some articles on the list have no known domestic production sources (e.g., quartz crystals or vanilla beans), many of the articles are known to have some domestic production sources, but those sources have been determined in the past to be inadequate to meet U.S. demand.  Examples of such articles range from goat and kidskins (negligible domestic production), to crude iodine (5 percent of U.S. Government and nongovernment demand), to bismuth (not in excess of 50 percent of U.S. Government and nongovernment demand).  The list has not been subjected to a thorough review since 1957.  Currently, the procedures for updating articles on the list rely on a contracting officer ’s notice to the Defense Acquisition Regulations (DAR) Council or the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) (in accordance with agency procedures) for possible addition or removal of an article from the list (FAR 25.103(b)(2)(ii) and FAR 25.104(b)).  With constantly changing market conditions, the Councils are seeking information to determine whether some articles should be removed from the list because they are now mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality.  Specific information with regard to domestic production capacity in relation to U.S. Government and nongovernment demand and the quality of domestically-produced items would be most helpful in determining whether articles should remain on or be removed from the list.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of License Opportunity, System Intrusion Alert Software Tool
<DESC>The Technical Support Working Group, Combating Terrorism Technology Support Office solicits interest from any party interested in the licensing of the Alert TRend Change Tool, (ATRaCT). This tool is used by security analysts to automatically detect a nd display trends in intrusion detection system alerts that may indicate new threats. Network-based intrusion detection (ID) systems generally produce large numbers of alerts. The analyst responsible for monitoring these alerts often spends so much time an alyzing each alert that he fails to see the large trends in alert levels, such as which alerts are becoming more common, or which alerts are no longer occurring. ATRaCT provides an overview of the current trends and alarms when significant trend changes oc cur. ATRaCT takes as input the alerts produced by Snort or other ID systems. It collects that data into hourly and daily segments, and stores the number of alerts and the number of source IP addresses causing alerts in each time period. The running mean an d standard deviation are also calculated for each alert and time period. These data are used to create graphs showing the trends in the alerts, as well as to determine when to issue an alarm.   ATRaCT runs on either a Linux or Solaris workstation The output of ATRaCT is standard HTML pages, viewable by the analyst in any standard web browser. It requires several freely available support software packages, most notably the MySQL database, all of w hich are included in the package. Companies interested in licensing this software for commercialization are asked to contact TechTrans@TSWG.gov for additional information.

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number USSS040037 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-09. This action is a 100% small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 481211, and the small business size standard is 1,500.  This solicitation will be issued using commercial practices in accordance with FAR Part 12.

The offeror will arrange for travel charter air services to various locations within the United States and International flights. Minimum trips required will be two, and the maximum may be twenty. The initial period of performance will begin June 8, 2004 through September 30, 2004 with two one year options.  The offeror must be able to meet the following requirements:   (1) Arrange for domestic and international charter aircraft services. 2) The offeror must have experience with Andrews Air Force Base and the Pentagon in securing air permits and landing rights for arrival and departures from Andrews Air Force Base.

(6) Have the appropriate top secret security background clearances and U.S. Citizenship is required.
   
Following quote evaluations, the government expects that the resultant contract will be a Firm-fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity award for a base period with two one year options. The following factors will be applied to determine the best value to the Government. The combined technical criteria (Elements A, B, C, D and E) may be considered more important than the price criteria. 1. TECHNICAL APPROACH:  A. Backup/Contingency Plan: The USSS requires both on-time performance and actual completion of all round trip flights. The offerors shall address plans to provide the required services, and shall offer solutions for mitigation of any breaks in service due to the fault of the contractor at both USSS Headquarters & the White House locations. Mechanical failures shall be considered the contractor’s fault. Circumstances beyond the contractor’s control (weather, air traffic control delays etc) are not considered to be the contractor’s fault. Subcontracting flights to mitigate cancellations or lateness is authorized; however, background checks must have already been performed on the pilots, flight crew, administrative staff and contractors.  B. Type of Aircraft & Age of Aircraft:   The offeror shall provide the type and age of the aircraft they propose to use for the charter air service. Also, include cost by block hour by fleet type to include seat configuration. C.  Security Clearances:  The offeror must have top secret security clearances. All contactor personnel proposed to work under this contract shall successfully pass USSS background investigations prior to contract award.    The USSS will provide contractor personnel access forms (SSF 3237) to be completed by the offeror and all proposed personnel and returned to the Service within two weeks prior to start of contract.   The contractor agrees that for due cause or anticipated security risk any contractor or subcontractor employee may be removed from duty at the USSS upon the Secret Service’s request.   It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide technically competent personnel that do not pose background or security concerns. Also, on-time reliability is very important. D. Past Experience:  Provide examples within the last three years of similar air charter service experience(s) that the offeror has provided that have resulted in an ongoing relationship with the customer(s). These examples shall indicate the competency the U.S. Secret Service can expect from the contractor performing the effort. Provide name, address, contact person, telephone number, date and description of service rendered, and verifiable data demonstrating performance history.  E. Reporting Requirements:  (POST AWARD) The successful offeror shall provide information brochures or pamphlets for distribution which describes the services provided.  Management Reports:  The successful offeror will provide quarterly and annual cost tracking reports of the frequency and dates of travel activities for U. S. Secret Service.  2. PRICE PROPOSAL:   The offeror’s pricing shall include all price elements associated with operation of  arranging travel charter air services including, but not limited to insurance, taxes, fuel, subcontracting, maintenance, labor and profit.

<DESC>The purposes of this amendment are (a) to clarify that this procurement is NOT being conducted as a small business set aside (it is being conducted on an unrestricted, competitive basis) and (b) to publish questions received to date for this RFQ and answers to those questions for all potential offers to consider.  QUESTION 1: What are the fastest achievable payment terms?  ANSWER TO QUESTION 1: Invoice(s) for the awarded PO will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act, 31 USC § 3903, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-125, Prompt Payment.  Generally, that means that invoice(s) can only be considered proper if they are submitted after NIST acceptance for the billed items has previously occurred and, by law, the proper invoice(s) must be paid within 30 days of receipt of a proper invoice, as a proper invoice is defined in that law.  (The invoice would need to contain everything requested in FAR clause 52.212-4(g), Invoice, to be considered proper.)  Discounts for prompt payment may be offered in the invoice.  QUESTION 2: May training be offered as two separate line items, each with a different focus:  Answer: Yes.  For Line item 0002, as with the equipment, it must be firm-fixed-price in a commercial item environment.  Therefore, it would only be billed at the end of the training, and not fractionally, if one training course is offered.  If more than one training course are offered, both of which will be provided, then two separate training CLIN's should be offered (0002 and 0003), one for each course, and then billed after completion of each one.  Multiple (i.e., alternate) offers are encouraged, as noted in provision 52.212-1(e) as long as each offer is firm-fixed-price and addresses all RFQ requirements.  END OF TEXT
