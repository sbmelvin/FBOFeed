(10) December 8/December 15
(17).    The Department of Engineering Mechanics has a requirement for the procurement of a scanning vibrating probe system to monitor electrochemical cells in aluminum alloys to understand the corrosion kinetics in aging aircraft structures.  We currently do not have any system to monitor the corrosion potentials and corrosion current path in aluminum alloys.  This equipment will enhance our capability to monitor corrosion in high strength aluminum alloys.  Corrosion of aging aircraft is a widespread problem in the Air Force?s fleet.  This equipment will add a new dimension to cadet curriculum and USAFA?s research by demonstrating the creation of electrochemical cells in aluminum alloys in a liquid electrolyte. Quantification of the current and its path will help us determine the kinetics of the reaction.  This instrument will become an integral part of corrosion demonstration for cadets of EM350, EM445 and EM460 classes.  This will also enable us to develop scientific basis for establishing inspection intervals to monitor corrosion in aging aircrafts.  

We are interested in procuring Model SVP100 system consisting of model SVP370 probe, model ECW370 system controller, model 283 potentiostat/galvanostat, GPIB connector and software from Princeton Applied Research, because of the state of the art instrumentation and controls available in this system.  However any equivalent or better system meeting the following specs will help the Academy accomplish its mission:
 
The scanning vibrating probe equipment should consist of the general capabilities:
?	Be modular in design.
?	Be able to measure the electrochemical activity on specimen non intrusively.
?	Must be completely automated with connections to potentiostat/galvanostat and control computer.

Specific technical requirements are:
?	SVP unit with: 
o	Minimum scanning capability of 12? X 12? in X-Y direction with at least 1 inch travel in z direction.
o	Probe resolution of at least 1 micron.
o	Vibration amplitude of 50 microns or higher.
o	Scanning speed of at least 1mm/sec.
o	Minimum electrochemical sensitivity of 5 ??A/cm2.
o	Lock-in amplifier with amplification of up to 100,000.
o	Minimum SVGA resolution of 800 X 600.

?	Potentiostat/Galvanostat:
o	Fully computer controlled.
o	Minimum sensitivity of 1 pA and 2mV.
o	Scan range of at least 12V and 100 mA.
o	Built in IR compensation.
o	Computer system and related hardware to control the two systems simultaneously.
A  52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal acquisition will be conducted.  The NAICS for this acquisition is 334519 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Women owned and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to submit offers.   This acquisition is set aside 100% for small business enterprises.  The solicitation will be electronically available through this web site.

<SOLNBR>HQ0147-06-0004
<RESPDATE>121506

<CONTACT>William Mils, Contracting Officer, Phone 256-313-9935, Fax 256-313-9703, Email bill.mills@mda.mil
<DESC>This notice is for information and planning purposes only as a final decision on this matter is pending and does not constitute an RFP or commitment by the government.  This will be our only notification of our intent to award a non-competitive contract for this effort.  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) anticipates awarding a sole source contract to the Boeing Company to support locating, designing, and establishing a Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) missile complex in Europe. A European-based missile defense is part of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Program Element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  The European GBI Missile Complex continues the MDA development and extension of necessary Engagement Sequence Groups (ESGs) critical to the spiral development of the BMDS. The Boeing Company provided the design, construction and integration of the current GMD/BMDS Missile Launch Complexes at Fort Greely, AK and Vandenberg AFB, CA.  The design, integration, build, check-out, and standup of the missile launch complex is scheduled to be completed by 4th quarter 2012, and support initial missile complex capability by 2011. The GMD segment of the BMDS is a highly complex, integrated system, comprised of sensors, launch equipment, Ground Based Interceptors, and tactical and non-tactical communications equipment integrated through software and hardware that allows for the real-time communications, weapons solutions development, weapons task plan hand-off and launch/intercept of incoming ballistic missiles. The BMDS European GBI Missile Complex will face a range of dynamic and technically complex system integration issues.  The tactical components will not only be integrated to work together as a site but will require integration into the overall GMD Weapon System and the BMDS. The BMDS European Site Missile Complex must be compatible with the current system architecture (sensors, communications, and fire control infrastructure) as well as future plans for system upgrades, expansion, or deployment of new BMDS components. Future versions include equipment for which requirements have not yet been defined (adjunct sensor), nor contracts awarded.  . The planned European GBI Missile Complex contract will be awarded while the GMD program is conducting flight tests on the Block 04 configuration.  Blocks 06 and 08, both system upgrades under the spiral development concept, will be fully integrated into the European Complex.  Development efforts for Block 10 will be in process when the European GBI Missile Complex is complete and activated.

The European GBI Missile Complex is inclusive of maintenance and other support buildings buildings, silo design/build, security and force protection features and accommodations, flight and/or missile control facilities, temporary or permanent housing, and necessary related infrastructure such as power, water, sewers, storm drainage and secure communication links.  Element integration activities will include the integration of all Government and Contractor Furnished Equipment such as Silos, Silo Interface Vaults (SIVs), Command Launch Equipment, commercial communications systems and other related tactical/non-tactical communications and launch equipment into the design, development, and installation of necessary hardware and software to support the European GBI Missile Complex activation/operation. Site Planning and Design shall ensure facility/GBI-Launch Equipmen/-Communication Component interfaces are coordinated, and the interfaces provide traceability to the component requirements.  These requirements will flow from the GMD development program through the GMD Capabilities Document into the facility design requirements. Planned period of performance for this effort is January 2007 through May 2008.  The Development/Site Activation and Integration portion of the contract establishes and implements procedures to ensure consistency and synchronization with the evolving GMD developmental efforts.  Due to the complexity of the overall BMDS mission and the GMD System Element, the integration portion is crucial to the success of this project. The BMDS European GBI Missile Complex will face complex integration issues with tactical components that must not only be integrated to work together as a site, but will require the GMD Element to work with the overall BMDS.  In this context, the European GBI Missile Complex must also be compatible with existing Sensors BMDS components and Communications System architecture, as well as future plans for upgrades, expansion, or deployment of new BMDS elements - to include AEGIS and FBX-T.  The European Complex will also require development to be fully interoperable  with future GBI variants such as the Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV) and Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI). The delivery, installation and integration of hardware provided under other GMD or other contracts must be coordinated into the design and construction activities to ensure synchronization across all contracts.  Hardware procurements from various MDA element programs must be acquired and delivered in accordance with specific construction schedule timelines and in accordance with other program requirements against those manufacturing lines. (this last sentence is awkward - I?m not sure what you mean.  Can you take a crack at rewriting it?) This effort will require considerable engineering, software and other expert technical effort to integrate the European missile defense complex with ongoing GMD and BMDS development programs. Development and Site Activation Integration efforts will be ongoing throughout the period of performance of this contract. Site Build Out and Activation includes site development, build out of the tactical and non-tactical facilities and related infrastructure, communications links, equipment emplacement and activation, facility commissioning, and installation and checkout to include subsystem and system level tests (SSCO/SICO).  The planned period of performance for this effort is June 2008 through September 2012.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The biennial research examinations are conducted at the NIH Clinic in the Gila River Indian Community. These examinations include testing for diabetes and its complications. DNA has been collected from peripheral blood samples in most participants been in the last 20 years. Previous analyses of family data, including a genome-wide linkage study, indicate a strong familial aggregation of diabetes in this community and the presumptive chromosomal locations of one or more diabetes-?susceptibility genes. Current technology now allows for much denser mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the entire genome than has been possible previously. Genotype DNA samples, to be provided by NIH from approximately 975 participants in the Gila River Indian Community study. Genotyping should include approximately 500,000 SNPs covering the entire human genome. Data will be provided to NlH in a computer-readable format.  The NIH will provide samples of DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes or cultured cells from study participants. The Contractor shall propose the quantity of DNA required per sample.  The Contractor shall propose the method for genotyping, including quality control measures, for approval by the NIH. It is estimated that approximately 40 quality control samples will be necessary.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 812930   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Office of Criminal Investigations Division (CID) has a need for seven (7) parking spaces for their 1811 agents in Philadelphia, PA.  Due  to the nature of the agents? work, the parking facility must 1) have covered parking; 2) be secured; 3) allow twenty-four (24) hours per day access to the facility; and 4) must be located within a two (2) block radius of the CID?s office at 1650 Arch Street; Philadelphia, PA 19103-2029.  These  requirements facilitate the EPA agents? ability to investigate environmental crimes, gather evidence, and meet with other law enforcement agencies quickly and efficiently.  This policy is consistent with 41 C.F.R. 102-34-245, which provides for the establishment of parking for official needs and  guidelines for agency implementation of parking.  The EPA intends to award a fixed-price purchase order, with four one-year option periods, to obtain seven (7) parking spaces, meeting the requirements listed above, for Government law enforcement vehicles in the support of the CID in Philadelphia,  PA.  The base period of performance is January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007.  All responsible sources may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the EPA.  Contractors must be able to meet the requirements listed above.  Contractors shall be evaluated in accordance with the criteria  contained within this solicitation as follows: price and technical capability of the item to meet the agency?s need.  The Government will award a purchase order to the lowest priced, technically acceptable contractor.  The contractor shall submit a firm fixed price quote for the above requirement.   The base year and each of the four one-year option periods shall be priced separately.  The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the  option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.  Awards may be made without further discussion.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 812930.  Responses to this posting  must be in writing and submitted to Melissa Kaps by email, kaps.melissa@epa.gov, or fax, (202) 565-2554, by no later than 4:00 p.m. E.S.T. on Friday, December 15, 2006.  All questions should be directed to Melissa Kaps via e-mail at kaps.melissa@epa.gov on or before 12:00 p.m. E.S.T. on Thursday,  December 7, 2006.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   Needs Assessment for EPA Criteria Pollutant Scientific Literature Database The Clean Air Act requires the establishment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the "criteria" air pollutants (ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide,  sulfur dioxide and lead) and the periodic review of these  standards. One of the primary responsibilities of the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) is to prepare Science Assessments (SA) and  Science Assessment Supporting Documents (SASDs) previously known as Air Quality Criteria Documents (AQCDs) for these criteria air pollutants.  The review of scientific literature is a fundamental component for these activities.  The EPA is considering the development of a continuous process that  will identify, compile, characterize and prioritize new scientific studies, which shall include the creation of an electronic database of information from the studies. Under this order, the EPA seeks to assess the needs of potential users of the literature database and to develop options for  database designs that meet these needs. An important factor in the creation of the database is that the database shall not be simply a method of linking a reference to a published abstract or paper. Input to the database shall be accomplished by individuals knowledgeable in the various scientific  disciplines contained in the SA/SASDs  and database references must be categorized into experiments relative to dose, exposure time, exposure model, endpoint and other parameters. Database queries shall be retrievable in tabular format. Epidemiology analysis and other data references shall be  categorized into usable information. This acquisition is designated as a small business set-aside under NAICS code 541710,  size standard of 500 employees and procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   Interested and responsible sources may submit a quotation in response to the RFQ -OH-07-00033, which shall be considered by the Agency.   The Government will award an order resulting from the RFQ to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ, meets  the minimum requirements of the  Statement of Work (SOW), delivery and task completion schedule.   The order resulting from this acquisition will be firm-fixed price.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the RFQ, but will provide electronic copies upon request. Requests must include company name, mailing address,  fax number and email address. All responsible sources may submit a written request to receive the RFQ to Yvonne Harris at  harris.yvonne@epa.gov or by fax at (513) 487-2107. All requests for the RFQ must be received at the office identified above no later than Thursday December 14, 2006. Telephone  responses will not be honored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is  RFQ-OH-07-00044.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated as a result of this full and open solicitation.  The NAICS code is 541620. NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES Background The  Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants.  NAAQS consist of a primary standard that is protective of human health and a secondary standard that is protective of human welfare (the environment). As part of the NAAQS  review process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air Quality  Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is in the process of reviewing the secondary NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) in a combined SA that will review the state of knowledge of both criteria air pollutants.  The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for NOx and SOx  is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established by the federal court.  EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the secondary NAAQS for NOx and SOx.  EPA's  proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the NOx/SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen and sulfur oxides will be reviewed and summarized in a Science  Assessment Support Document (SASD) and integrated and synthesized in the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors' review meeting sponsored by the EPA. The draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer-review draft that will be vetted at a  peer-review meeting.  Peer-review comments will be incorporated into the draft final SASD.  From the revised SASD, the SA will be prepared as an external review draft for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for public comment.   EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the NOx/SOx ISA for public and CASAC review before completion of the final document. Contractor support is required for the review, critical evaluation, interpretation, summarization, and integration of the available scientific knowledge base, pertaining to  oxides of nitrogen and sulfur as described  in the Statement of Work. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops website.

<SUBJECT>R -- Mathematical Methods for Atmospheric Pollutant Dispersion Modeling Research Support
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NRMAC000-7-00014
<RESPDATE>121506
<ARCHDATE>12282006
<CONTACT>Robin Prather, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-713-0820 x126, Fax 301-713-0806, Email Robin.Prather@noaa.gov
<DESC>The DOC/NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) has a need for general research support in mathematical methods with application to meteorology and atmospheric dispersion.  This includes systems of hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDE) and ordinary differential equations, as applied to problems in meteorology, dispersion, and trajectories, as well as linear analysis, in addition to coordinate system transformations, such as required for geospatial data mapping and data interpolation methods. 

The contractor shall assist ARL staff in developing solutions as required for problems as they arise in each of their respective project areas.  

The increasing concern with the release of potentially hazardous materials into the atmosphere highlights the importance of further development and improvement of numerical modeling methods that are used by NOAA to forecast the transport and spread of these materials.  The Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) is responsible for maintaining NOAA models used to predict the spread of ash from volcanic eruptions, smoke from wildfires, radioactive materials from nuclear power plant accidents, and more recently, potential releases of hazardous materials from homeland security incidents.

Because the deliverable time frames and specific project support requirements cannot be predicted in advance, the intent is to provide support on an as-needed hourly basis.      

All responses must address experience with the following:  NOAA meteorological products and data structures; ARL data archives and management; Developing geospatial mapping techniques; Developing systems of PDEs that describe meteorological and dispersion processes, and analytic or numeric solutions to those PDEs; Integrating projects developed in various languages, especially FORTRAN, C and TCL/TK into a portable package that runs on a variety of UNIX platforms. 

Some of the identified tasks to be performed are as follows:

1) Reconfigure the ARL meteorological data archiving access methods to use the new NOAA standard of Gridded Binary 2 format.
2) Revise the X.25 data communications protocols between ARL computers and the National Weather Service's telecommunications gateway to use TCP/IP.
3) Convert satellite grid point data to ESRI display standards and develop various polygon manipulation procedures for display on various map projections.
4) Evaluate techniques to interpolate observational data into gridded meteorological data fields while considering the constraints imposed by the atmospheric equations of motion.
5) Applications delivered under the previous items should be packaged to run under the TCL/TK graphical user interface on UNIX computer systems.

The period of performance is expected to be twelve months.  Performance is expected to begin on or about January 1, 2007.  Award of a labor hour purchase order shall be made on a best-value basis.  Offers will be evaluated based upon approach, past performance and price.  While these factors are relatively equal, they are listed in order of importance.  It is estimated that 600 hours would fulfill the requirements under this acquisition and this number shall be used for pricing purposes.  This solicitation is set aside exclusively for Small Business concerns.

The solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Number 2005-14. The provisions and clauses may be downloaded at http://www.arnet.gov/far. The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.213-4, Terms and Conditions - Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Items); FAR 52.232-7, Payments Under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts.   Interested contractors must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at the CCR website (www.ccr.gov).  

This announcement constitutes the notice and solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

Responsible sources may respond to this notice with a quotation addressed to Robin Prather, NOAA Acquisition Division, 1305 East West Highway, Room 7146, Silver Spring MD 20910, to be received no later than 1:00 p.m., December 15, 2006.  Responses may be faxed to 301-713-0806 or emailed to Robin.Prather@noaa.gov.  Responses must be no more than 10 pages.  The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award as a result of this RFQ.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to confirm NOAA's receipt of quote.

<DESC>THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FROM PROPERTY OWNERS TO PROVIDE A BUILDING SITE IN THE AREA OF THE CITY OF TUCSON, CALIFORNIA

The Federal Government is seeking expressions of interests from current property owners or their authorized brokers for a no-cost assignable option to purchase land for a building site.  The Government selected developer will exercise the option at the negotiated purchase price.  

To receive consideration, the property must lie within the following boundaries:  22nd Street and Starr Pass Boulevard on the South; Mission Road, South Grande Avenue and North Grande Avenue to the west; West Speedway Boulevard to the north; and North Euclid Avenue, South Euclid Avenue and South Park Avenue to the east.

The site must be strategically located for the operational needs of a federal agency.   Zoning of adjacent properties and master planning of the general area should be compatible with the proposed project.  The property must have easy access to major freeways but not be adjacent to overpasses, bridges, elevated ramps or railroad tracks. Sites should have adequate electrical power, sanitary sewer, water, telephone, cable TV and fiber optics available, or easily accessible.  

Any property submitted for consideration must be relatively flat and consist of approximately 5 - 7 contiguous buildable acres and located outside of any designated 100 year floodplain.  The property should not have any easements or right-of-ways encroaching on the secured portion of the site or reducing the site's usable area. 

A current preliminary title report and any existing Phase I environmental site assessment reports, boundary surveys, soil reports, geotechnical reports, cultural resources reports or other pertinent data must accompany each expression of interest.  In addition, all submittals must include a representation of the agent's authority to tender the offer on behalf of the current fee owner.

The federal government will determine how to develop the site and hereby notifies all interested parties that we may consider properties other than those offered in response to this advertisement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Infrared Radiation Effects Laboratory (IRREL)
<SOLNBR>VS-07-04
<CONTACT>Wayne Zitzka, Contract Specialist, Phone 505 846 4987, Fax 505 846 6022, Email Wayne.Zitzka@Kirtland.af.mil
<DESC>A. The Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VSSS), is requesting proposals (technical and cost/business) in response to this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  The primary objective of this BAA is to conduct innovative development programs to identify operational procedures, test procedures, analytical techniques and test hardware that will advance the state of the art in the analytical and experimental capabilities of the AFRL Infrared Radiation Effects Laboratory (IRREL), located at Kirtland AFB, NM, for radiometric, radiation and electronic characterization of sensor devices for space applications.  In addition to designing and developing new experimental techniques and test fixtures needed to characterize space sensor devices, the successful offeror will be responsible for scheduling and controlling the daily activities of IRREL in support of developing and transitioning high payoff space technologies in support of future DOD space systems to include the conduct of laboratory safety and property accountability programs that comply with all applicable Government, Air Force, Kirtland Air Force Base and Phillips Research Site regulations and instructions.  A Cobalt-60 certified operator?s license as outlined by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is required.  This 5-year program is estimated to cost in the range of $5-6.5 Million dollars.

B. This effort requires the development of characterization methods utilizing the independent Air Force characterization facility, the Infrared Radiation Effects Laboratory (IRREL). This laboratory and its personnel execute the radiometric and radiation response characterizations and provide the resultant data packages.  The data and analyses produced by this laboratory are vitally important in determining the overall performance and radiation hardness of devices for use in space applications. In order to perform the above, the contractor will need to perform day to day operations and management of the laboratory.

C. This technical effort anticipates the following areas: (1) Radiometric characterization of focal plane arrays (FPAs), detector arrays and individual detectors, (2) Electronic characterization of multiplexer/readouts and individual circuits, (3) Radiation characterization of readout integrated circuits, test device structures, and space FPAs using gamma radiation, proton radiation, x-rays, electrons, and heavy ions.
 
D. Testing may utilize the Mosaic Array Test System (MATS), which will be furnished by the Government, to characterize devices at cryogenic temperatures in both clear and radiation environments. This includes characterizations at Kirtland AFB, NM to include IRREL and the AFRL Colbalt-60 source and at a NRC regulated proton source.  It is estimated that the IRREL lab on the average will perform 20-25 characterizations per year including approximately 6 characterizations at the offeror?s selected proton source estimated at 6 days per characterization.

E. The contractor shall conduct innovative development programs to identify operational procedures, test procedures, analytical techniques, and/or test hardware that will advance the state-of-the-art in test devices and the analytical and experimental capabilities of the laboratory. The end products from characterization will be test plans, test data, data briefings, technical reports, and in-depth data analysis. Work performed may be classified up to the TS/SCI level.  The contractor shall make recommendations to the Government on the scheduling for the implementation of these programs. Upon approval from the Government and the availability of funds, the contractor shall perform all necessary analysis, design, fabrication, integration, and evaluation of hardware and/or software necessary to accomplish characterization. Any improvements or changes to the government furnished equipment shall be appropriately documented and each shall be beneficial to the Air Force and advance the state-of-the-art in FPA characterization.

F. The IRREL staff will be required to provide technical advisor support to the AFRL.  This technical advisor support will consist of: (1) supporting program reviews for AFRL technology development programs, (2) developing technical specifications for AFRL technology development programs, (3) and serving as advisors to the Government when the Government is performing evaluations on initial contractor proposals.  This will be a very minor portion of the effort and must be broken out separately in both the SOW and cost proposal (approximately 10 days per year).

G. A minimum of one member of the IRREL technical staff must possess and maintain a Cobalt-60 certified source operator?s license as outlined by the NRC. Other staff may be added if demanded by the work schedule and approved by the government.
  
H.  The contractor should conduct a continuing safety program for the duration of the contract to assure that safety features are incorporated into the operation of the laboratory and the design and fabrication of the test equipment. The IRREL staff will be required to comply with KAFB Instruction 32-7001, dated 1 February 1996, for managing hazardous materials and the Phillips Research Site Operating Instruction 21-101, for tool control.

 *	When will the target dates/milestones of this Competition Schedule be published?

The schedule should be released with a Request for Information (RFI) to be published in November.

 *	Based on the dates mentioned in the Special Notice and FDA web site, should we assume that the FDA will/has already requested from OMB to grant a6-month extension on this competition (the length of this A76 competition will be 18 months)

Yes, the FDA was granted a 6 month extension on this competition.

 *	Has the FDA MEO Team and PWS Team been established yet?
Yes

 *	Does the FDA MEO desire to team with industry, and if so, per the A76 Circular, will the FDA MEO only be able to team with those companies that already have in-scope, incumbent support contracts in place with the FDA?

The Government's Agency Tender Team will determine its strategy in terms of potential partnering. If the Agency Tender Team deems it necessary, a Sources Sought synopsis will be published in FedBizOpps seeking input from interested firms.  The purpose of FedBizOpps announcement dated 9/15/06 was to provide public notice of the Standard Competition, not to solicit potential partners.
   If the Agency Tender Team elects to consider new partners,  it will be bound by the provisions of OMB Circular A-76, Attachment B, paragraph C.4.a.(1)(a), which states: "Agencies shall not include new MEO subcontracts that would result in the direct conversion of work performed by government
employees."   


*	Are the FDA employees that are currently performing this work part of a Union/Union employees? One Union or multiple Unions? 

Yes, the unions are FDA/NTEU and AFGE.

 *	How many people/contractors make up the multiple, in-scope, support contracts mentioned?

This is being further developed and will be a part of the draft Performance Work Statement released with the RFI.

 *	Has a Preliminary Planning Report or any independent studies been completed for the in-scope OITSS services that make up this A76? Are these documents available to review?

A Functional Assessment is in process. The final report has not been completed.  We intend to issue a draft Performance Work Statement which will address the scope of work anticipated for this A-76 study.

<SUBJECT>99--AFTIL Market Survey/Sources Sought
<SOLNBR>5260
<RESPDATE>121206
<CONTACT>Phyliss Schlegel, 609-485-4380
<DESC>Amendment 2 follows: This is the second amendment to AFTIL Market Survey. 1.  The following changes should be made, pen and ink, to Paragraph 9 of the Draft Statement of Work:      a) The abbreviation (SME) is deleted from the Computer Aided Design (CAD) and 3D Real-Time Modeling Specialist labor category;      b) AT Specialist (AA):  is corrected to read AT Specialist: and      c) The Administrative Assistant labor category is deleted. 2.  There were several questions posed regarding the predecessor contract. Question:  Who was the contractor and are they eligible to compete?   Answer:  The contract was awarded to Joseph Sheairs Associates.  This SEDB firm subsequently became part of L-3 Ilex.  As such, they are a large business and no longer a viable competitor if the FAA sets this aside for SEDBs or for any small business category. Question:  Are the current employees available as part of any potential transition? Answer:  Arrangements between employees and their employers is on a free will basis.  The FAA is not able to speak to the current employees' availability. Question:  What was the contract number, start date, expiration date and value? The Contract # was DTFA03-00-D-00022, Delivery Order 0002.  The Delivery Order started in February, 2001 and is scheduled to expire in June, 2007.  The total dollars obligated to date are $6,977,759.37; however, this order also covered work for Flight Support Services (FSS).  FSS was recently re-competed and awarded as a separate contract and is not included in the current SOW.  It is estimated that 35% of the funding on Delivery Order 0002 was used for FSS. Question:  When do you expect to award the follow-on contract? Answer:  This is a market survey/sources sought announcement, with the single purpose of discovering the capable competition available in the SEDB and SDVOSB business community. Timelines for the follow-on contract have not been established.  3.  Question:  Our firm has experience in the tools mentioned but we do not have expertise related specifically to FAA or its operational needs.  Is this knowledge of FAA component essential?   Answer:  Demonstration of the requisite corporate experience in the tools is essential, regardless of whether the work environment was FAA, NASA, military, commercial customer, etc.  4.  Amendment 1 requested that SDVOSB firms include a certifying letter from the Small Business Administration.  This is not required.  However, SDVOSBs can establish their eligibility to compete in this category by either providing:   A letter from their local Veterans Administration (VA) showing that the owner is a service connected disabled veteran with a rated disability; or   A copy of the rating letter received from the VA or the military service awarding the rating after redacting the percentage, reason for the rating or other person information not necessary for the certification. 5.  A request was made to change the North American Industry Code Standard.  Upon review, the FAA is satisfied that the Engineering Services, 541330, is appropriate for the work contemplated. -------------End of Amendment 2----------------------------------- The market survey is hereby expanded to include Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  SDVOSBs possessing the requisite capabilities to accomplish the tasks in the SOW work are invited to respond by 2 p.m. local time on December 12, 2006 and shall provide all items requested in the original announcement, including a copy of a letter from the Small Business Administration certifying their status as an SDVOSB.   The due date for submissions from SEDB/8(a) firms is unchanged, i.e. due by 2 p.m., local time, December 6, 2006. All submissions shall be delivered to: 	Federal Aviation Administration  	William J. Hughes Technical Center 	Engineering Services Acquisition Sub-Team (AJP-7551) 	Attn:  P. Schlegel 	Atlantic City International Airport, NJ 08405 Submissions shall be marked "AFTIL Market Survey Responses" and must include one (1) original and three (3) copies.   --------------End of Amendment-------------------------------------------- This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.2.4.  It is a survey, not a solicitation, to determine interest and capabilities of interested Small Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB).  A predecessor contract, #DTFA03-00-D-00022, Delivery Order 0002, was originally awarded to a SEDB firm.  The FAA has an ongoing need for some, but not all, of the tasks that were in this order.  This market survey is being conducted to aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside competition to SEDBs.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. The North American Industry Code Standard for the work comtemplated is 541330, Engineering Services.  The size standard is $4.5 million. A draft Statement of Work for Airport Facilities Terminal Integration Laboratory (AFTIL) support services is attached.  The FAA has a need for these requirements for the next five years. Interested companies are required to provide: -A copy of a letter from the Small Business Administratin certifying their status as a SEDB/8(a) firm. -Completed Business Declaration Form, (attached) -A capability summary of not more than 8 pages that addresses corporate capabilities specific to accomplish this work and transition of existing contract in a seamless manner.  The summary should include information on how contractor personnel will be supplied, i.e., currently available as employees of the prime, subcontractor arrangements, etc. Submission of these items is requested by 2 p.m. local time on December 6, 2006.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of responses to this announcement.  Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities.  Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is a sources sought announcement so no solicitation exists; please do not request one.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page and it is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for release.  If a determination to set this requirement aside for SEDBs is made, failure to respond to this announcement may result in exclusion of offeror from completition since the competition may be released to qualified, responding SEDBs. Inquiries relative to this announcement are to be submitted in writing only via e-mail to Phyliss.Schlegel @faa.gov.

The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered to each awardee under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Services to be performed under the resulting contract(s) may include the following facility investment & utilities operations and maintenance: Building & Structures maintenance (interior & exterior finishes, plumbing, grease traps, exhaust hoods & ducts, electrical, structural, bridge & jib cranes, re-lamping, and locksmith); Building Systems (HVAC, fire protection, VTE, intrusion detection systems, boilers, and compressed air systems); Miscellaneous (cathodic protection systems, emergency generator systems, uninterruptible power systems, and lightning arrestors & grounding devices); Roads & Paved surfaces (traffic control devices, striping, curbs, sidewalks and parking lots, bridges, and drainage systems); Waterfront (piers & bulkheads, and wharfs); Trackage (railroads, crane, and elevated crane); Airfields (runways, taxiways, and navigational aids & lighting); Family housing/Bachelor Quarters; Miscellaneous Items (signage, fencing, and food service equipment); chiller plants, electrical, gas, wastewater, steam, and water.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  
Factor 1 - Experience
Factor 2 - Past Performance 
Factor 3 - Technical Approach
Factor 4 - Management
Factor 5 - Safety
Factor 6 - Price
Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors: The evaluation factors are divided into two categories; non-price evaluation factors (Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5) and price (Factor 6).  Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, the non-priced Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 are approximately equal to Price, Factor 6.  The importance of price will increase if offerors non-price proposals are considered essentially equal in terms of technical quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal?s technical superiority to the Government.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.  Proposed Task Order (PTO) 0001: The Contractor shall be required to perform maintenance, repair, and minor construction for hoods, vents, exhaust units, make-up air units, air handling units, and heating and air conditioning units at various locations at Camp Pendleton, California, see solicitation for specific locations.

<SUBJECT>R -- TECD CREDIT CARD PROGRAM
<SOLNBR>S-AQMPD-07-R-0001
<RESPDATE>121406
<ARCHDATE>12292006
<CONTACT>Pete Jones, Contract 0fficer, Phone 7038756273, Fax 7038756085, Email jonespw@state.gov
<DESC>The service provider shall provide the necessary products and services to accomplish all of the requirements stated herein.
The Office of Foreign Missions (OFM) in the Department of State seeks to institute a credit and/or debit card based system to manage its obligation for providing diplomatic tax-relief privileges for foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations and their members throughout the United States.  This new system will be referred to as the Diplomatic Tax-Exempt Credit/Debit (TECD) Program.    

OFM seeks from the private sector proposals for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges initiated through the use of a provider issued ?tax-exempt? credit and/or debit card to foreign missions, international organizations and their eligible personnel.  ?Tax-Exempt? means vendors should exempt or remove charges associated with most taxes on purchases made using such cards.  The U.S. government will not underwrite or assume any liability for these credit/debit cards, and also will not guarantee payment of the debts on these credit cards. All risk in extending credit will fall on the credit issuer.  

OFM hopes to eventually provide diplomatic tax-relief privileges solely through a credit/debit card-based system.  However, it accepts that technological and programmatic issues stand as current obstacles to achieving this vision.   Therefore, this credit/debit card will serve as one of two systems that OFM will make available to the foreign mission and international organization community for obtaining diplomatic tax.  OFM estimates that such credit/debit cards will be used frequently and will likely have a higher average use-rate in comparison to those issued to average consumers.  

The tax-exemption identification cards that OFM currently produces will continue to exist as an option for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges.  However, the option to use the existing system will only be available to certain individuals.  Therefore, the majority of the diplomatic and international community will receive their tax-relief benefits through the TECD Program.  Each mission/organization will have the option of using either the existing tax-exemption identification card system or the new TECD Program.  In the event the selected bank is unable to provide services to a mission/organization or their members, they will be able to use the existing system.   

There are roughly 9,000 diplomatic tax-exemption cards currently circulating throughout the United States.  

The provision of this service will attract the operating accounts of many foreign missions and international organizations as well as their members to the bank selected for this program.  Therefore, service providers stand to generate new revenues not only from providing this system, but also through the added customer and deposit base that goes along with providing banking services to such account holders.  

As a point of reference concerning the credit worthiness of foreign missions and their members, in conjunction with participating oil companies, OFM has provided ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards to foreign missions and diplomats since the mid-1980s.  Although, the tax-relief mechanism used with this card is vastly different from the one described in this document, the extension and management of credit to foreign missions and their members is basically identical.   Over the past 20 years, the service providers of the ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards have reported extremely few problems concerning foreign missions or their members as routinely delinquent or unable to pay balances on such accounts.  A list of the oil companies that participate in the ?tax-exempt gasoline credit card program can be viewed on the OFM website at www.state.gov/ofm/tax/gasoline/24625.htm.  

OFM will permit the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to participate in the TECD program to facilitate its responsibility to provide tax-relief privileges to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) and its members.  These privileges are established under the Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8) of April 10, 1979.   AIT will serve most of the roles/responsibilities identified for OFM in this document.  

This solicitation not only offers the opportunity for service providers to present a solution to OFM?s business process needs for a credit and/or debit card based diplomatic tax relief program, but to propose added services that might realize the Department of State?s vision of electronic and streamlined government business processes, both domestically and abroad.

Currently, OFM plans to offer this opportunity to all service providers capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.   

Background of the Diplomatic Tax Exemption Process:
The Foreign Missions Act of 1982 (22 USC 4301-4316) requires that OFM manage the U.S. Government?s provision of certain diplomatic privileges on the basis of reciprocity.

<DESC>The Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Martinsburg, WV, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Ovid Technologies Ltd., 333 7th Avenue, New York, NY  10001, under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This acquisition will be accomplished using commercial item procedures in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 519120 and the business size standard is $6.5M.   The contractor will provide online service for access to existing databases, journals and textbook subscriptions to all sites within VISN 5.  Period of performance will be 1/1/07 through 12/31/07 with 4-1 option years.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive offers.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted.  However, interested parties have until 4:00 PM local time, November 21, 2006 to submit, in writing, their interest, qualifications/capabilities, and literature, detailing how their online subscription services will meet VA requirements to the contracting office or by fax 304-264-3997.  A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no responses are received, the VA will proceed with the sole source procurement. JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION In accordance with FAR 6.303, justification and approval for other than full and open competition is hereby approved for the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority cited herein. 1.  CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:     VA Medical Center  (613)     510 Butler Avenue, Bldg. 308B     Martinsburg, WV  25405 2.  NATURE OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:  This justification and approval will enable the VA to have fulfill a requirement for application software site licenses and subscriptions of OVID on-line databases. 3.  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES:  Provide subscriptions and licenses to the VISN 5 facilities and to VAMC Washington, DC for a base year plus 4-1 option years at an estimated cost of $792,000.00. 4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), FAR 15. 5.  RATIONALE SUPPORTING USE OF AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE: It has become essential that various clinical data and information are made readily available to healthcare providers to better serve out veteran population.  In this age of technology, much of this information is available via on-line databases.  Ease in accessing this information, as well as its completeness and accuracy, is vital in making treatment decisions, diagnoses, identifying drug interactions, bringing new medications to our attention, enlightening and heightening surgical techniques, and a multitude of other valuable assets.  While other vendors offer similar services, OVID offers the most complete and comprehensive databases, including full text publications (rather than only a synopsis, as available from other sources), made readily and easily accessible at no additional cost to the user (additional fees are charged by other sources to access some publications).  It is therefore determined that contracting with OVID Technologies, Inc. on a sole-source basis is in the best interest of the Government. 6.  EFFORT TO SOLICIT POTENTIAL SOURCES:  This procurement has been synopsized in the Business Opportunities System (BOS).  A copy of the solicitation was displayed at the contracting office.   7.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  The anticipated cost is considered fair and reasonable to the Government based on market information and using service estimates. 8.  MARKET RESEARCH:  A market survey was conducted by the using department, as indicated in

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration Office of IT Shared Services is publishing this Sources Sought Synopsis in order to obtain comments/inputs from interested parties / potential teaming partners for the Most Efficient Organization (MEO) concerning the FDA announced OMB A-76 Standard Competition Study of its Office of Information Technology Shared Services (OITSS) functions.   This sources sought synopsis is being published for the gathering of information / planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for competitive proposals (RFP), quotes (RFQ), Invitation for Bid (IFB), or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government.  Funding is presently not available and not guaranteed. Costs associated with the preparation and submission of information and/or any follow-up information requests are the responsibility of the Interested Party and these costs will not be reimbursed by the Government.  This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by OITSS/FDA/HHS to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis.  The information provided by the Interested Parties will be evaluated to identify qualified potential MEO subcontractors / teaming partners.  The government will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside of the government, any information marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the Interested Party.  Any information submitted under this Sources Sought Synopsis is strictly voluntary. The estimated completion date of the study is January 2008.  The projected Period of Performance (POP) will be five years from date of award.  In September 2006, FDA announced an OMB A-76 Standard Competition Study of its Office of Information Technology Shared Services (OITSS) functions on the Government?s Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.

<SUBJECT>D -- RFI - Warehouse Management System
<SOLNBR>HSTS07-07-I-0014
<RESPDATE>121506
<CONTACT>Kari Santoro, Management and Program Analyst, Phone 609-813-3305, Fax 609-813-3446, Email kari.santoro@dhs.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) being issued for market research purposes.  The objective of this RFI is to: (1) identify potential Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Warehouse Management System (WMS) solutions; and (2) to obtain a rough order of magnitude for the cost and time estimated to implement such at a Property Management Office within the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).  Please note:  the intent of the system is to maintain warehouse/inventory data for consumables only and will not be used to manage accountable property which is tracked in other TSA asset management systems.


Presently, warehouse inventory (consumables only) is managed and tracked using a MS Excel spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet and associated manual processes have worked well to this point, but is growing cumbersome to use as the number/types of consumable items maintained in inventory has grown.  To address this problem, we are seeking industry comment and feedback to assist in identifying a cost-effective, user-friendly solution that can replace the outgrown spreadsheets, improve the ability to maintain inventory at optimum levels, and enhance the accuracy of forecasts for consumable items.  It is anticipated that the government would need support for the initial implementation of any resultant solution (to include activities such as: closeness-of-fit assessment, hardware/software installation, preparation of certification and accreditation (C&A) documentation, and training/knowledge transfer) but upon turnover, the government would assume responsibility for operating and maintaining the system.

Parties are asked to submit information about commercially available Warehouse Management Systems with a rough order of magnitude reflecting anticipated costs and projected timelines to implement a production system that meets the following requirements:

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: 
- Includes security that restricts access to system functionality by user role; enforces secure password polices and routine resets; and provides an audit trail of user activity within the application;
- Complies with federal government IT security requirements, such as: Office of Management & Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources; Public Law 100-235, The Computer Security Act of 1987; Public Law 107-347, Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002;
- Complies with Section 508 accessibility requirements for information technology products;
- Maintains transaction details to support account balances and provides an audit trail to trace transactions from original inputs, source documents, and system generated transactions; 
- Allows records/data contained within the system to be queried and extracted to other applications, such as MS Excel or MS Word; 
- Supports both batch and real-time data entry and uses the same edits and update rules as appropriate for each mode;
- Permits only authorized users to enter, modify, or otherwise alter inventory records;
- Includes easy to use functionality with a relatively low learning curve.  

The government is seeking solutions that are scalable.  Web-based applications that are capable of displaying availability of items and inventory levels to support electronic ordering by geographically dispersed sites are also preferred.  Presently, it is anticipated that this will be a standalone system; no requirements for the system to be integrated or interfaced to/from core financial or procurement systems have been identified.  

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: 
- Captures receipt and acceptance by line item of all deliveries at the warehouse, representing approximately 3,000 consumable line items;
- Tracks receipt by tracking number, weight, shipper information and receiver's initials; capturing complete, partial and rejected shipments at the line item level and displays information from previous receipts highlighting those items that were received; 
- Allows capture of item data using both bar code scanner and manual means;
- Provides functionality that records beginning inventory balances (on-hand); increments or decrements balance to account for acquisitions, adjustments, or withdrawals; calculates ending inventory balances (on-hand) at the item level of detail and records an audit trail of such transactions;
- Expresses on-hand balances/inventory data at the line item level in both dollars and physical units;
- Tracks unit cost per item and quantities at item level, maintains running balances,  and provides ability to calculate item subtotal and total inventory values;
- Provides ability to calculate Economic Order Quantity or equivalent information at item level detail (For example: determine monthly burn rate; establish thresholds for maintaining min./max. stock levels); 
- Classifies item types to allow for differentiation between like/unlike items (For example:  captures differing sizes or colors of clothing; distinguishes between Depot items or Consumable items stored at the warehouse) 
- Tracks incoming items from receipt at the dock to point of destination (i.e.: redelivery to the customer) and identifies such as inventory, redelivery, depot items, etc.;
- Includes flexible query and reporting capabilities that support forecasting and trend analysis (such as projecting future ordering requirements by category or item type; or determining utilization rates by geographic location) allowing both standard and ad hoc queries/reports and statistical analysis;
- Provides functionality to forecast inventory, ensure stock availability, and maintain proper inventory levels to permit avoidance of excess inventory costs; 
- Supports ability to control inventory and track physical location by rack, shelf, bin, etc. and categorize by class;
- Includes a web-based graphical interface with customer-facing view (supporting min. of 10 simultaneous users), capable of displaying images of items in inventory and provides functionality that gives customers the ability to identify what is in/out of stock and what is on backorder;
- Prints orders, receipts, and/or inspection forms with option for the user to determine number of copies printed.  

Although not required, on-line catalog and shopping cart functionality would be beneficial if it allowed geographically dispersed offices to place an order electronically from available stock and generated a system issued notification sent directly to the warehouse manager for order fulfillment.  


Parties responding to this RFI are requested to identify their business size (small, small-disadvantaged, hub zone, large, etc.).  Please identify in your response whether a test package or demo software is available for review and POC/process for requesting one, should the Government wish to request one for further evaluation.  Responders are requested to provide information on successful implementations for similar requirements within other federal agencies and/or to suggest criteria or factors that the Government should consider in development an RFQ or RFP should it choose to issue one. 

Informational responses must be submitted to Kari Santoro via email at kari.santoro@dhs.gov.  Please reference: HSTS07-07-I-0014 in the subject line of the email. Written responses are requested; there can be no assurance that voice inquiries will be answered or returned.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  The Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  Based upon responses received, the Government reserves the right to determine the acquisition strategy, including the right to set-aside any procurements that may result hereunder for small or minority-owned businesses.

<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>The National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, in conjunction with the Center for Functional Nanomaterials, is developing a new undulator beamline for the characterization of soft condensed matter materials and surfaces.  The endstation for the new Beamline X9 will be dedicated to hard x-ray scattering in small-angle and grazing-incidence geometries.  As accurate, high-resolution, and robust sample manipulation is a requirement  Brookhaven Science Associates requires a Hexapod Sample Manipulator. The Hexapod required is a manipulator built from six linear actuators capable of ?? 50 nm steps, with the six legs pivoting against a base platform and supporting an upper platform. 

This, acquisition, is a, ??Best Value??, procurement.  The utilization of this procedure is expected to provide the greatest overall benefit to BSA/BNL.  ??Best Value?? employs a trade off process that permits award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the highest technically rated offeror.  The tradeoff process, associated with Best Value involves a comparative weighing of the evaluation factors and sub-factors identified in the Request for Proposals (RFP).   Specifically, the trade off process involves selecting the most advantageous offer based upon an integrated assessment of both non-cost/price factors, taken in their assigned relative importance.  

The following factors, in their relative order of weighting, will be utilized to evaluate the offers:

-  General Technical Specifications: Submit operating specifications for the proposed Hexapod Sample Manipulator system utilizing the same format (Section and Sub-Section numbering) presented by the specifications contained in the solicitation.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances ? the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

?	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
?	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in a field related to business or engineering is desired.
?	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
?	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
?	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
?	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
?	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.
III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

POSITION TITLE: Poppy Elimination Program Advisor
MARKET VALUE: FS-02
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  January 2007- December 2007 extendable as required.
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Kabul, Afghanistan
JOB DESCRIPTION:  See below 

GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

A.	Background

This position is located in the American Embassy, Kabul, Afghanistan in the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS), which administers a $700m foreign assistance program supporting Government of Afghanistan (GOA) efforts to combat narcotics, restore rule of law and establish a civilian police presence on a national level.  Within the NAS office, the Poppy Elimination Program Advisor (PEP) oversees a $20m program that aims to reduce poppy cultivation at the provincial level by conducting outreach activities and providing direct support to local Afghan governors as part of the Ministry of Counter-narcotics? province?based implementation of the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy (NDCS).  PEP is a multi-disciplinary approach that cuts across the elements of the NDCS, and the PEP teams provide governors with knowledge of district and village stakeholders, awareness of development projects and expertise in agricultural matters.  The teams also transmit information and aims to influence opium cultivation-related behaviors by educating the public on the counter-narcotics strategy and the governors' efforts to eliminate poppy cultivation.  The PEP teams also provide a critical link from these provinces to the central government on counter-narcotics program matters.

B.	Supervisory Controls  

The contractor works under the supervision of the Narcotics Affairs Section Director, however, the individual exercises wide latitude for independent action, designing programs and implementing approved new programs under general supervision.  Completed work is reviewed for timeliness and effectiveness. 	

C.	Statement of Work

Serves as the NAS Director?s principal advisor on PEP, supervises foreign nationals and contractors associated with implementing the PEP program, and ensuring that the PEP contractors and Afghan personnel address the following issues:

1.	Act as a Resource to the Provincial Governors  
The PEP teams provide Governors with knowledge of district and village stakeholders, awareness of development projects and expertise in agricultural matters.  The teams also transmit information and aims to influence opium cultivation-related behaviors by educating the public on the CN strategy and the Governors efforts to eliminate poppy cultivation.  The PEP teams also provide a critical link from these provinces to the central government on CN program matters.

2.	Act as Development Liaison  
Provide farmers with economic opportunities and alternatives to poppy cultivation as an essential part of the counter-narcotics strategy in Afghanistan.  The role of PEP in this regard is to map existing development and alternative livelihood projects; serve as interlocutors to the donors; and, report to the Governors and MCN on the community level perceptions of projects and needs.  It is vital that that the PEP teams establish good working relations with the major donors. 

3.	Provide Community Outreach  
The goal of PEP?s community outreach work is to alter attitudes and behaviors in an Afghan culture where too many people have come to depend upon the cultivation of poppy - despite its illegality, the major public health hazard that it presents, and its threat to security and governance.  PEP is working to change attitudes and behaviors and gain buy-in and support through community outreach to everyone throughout the province.  PEP is likely to have most impact in delivering CN communications by working with and through grassroots community networks, including clinics, teachers, mullahs and ulema, and by supporting provincial, district and village shuras and jirgas.  They will also assist provincial officials in delivering CN messages through working with the local media (TV, radio, newspapers).

4.	Act as Monitor  
One of the most direct ways to affect the farmer?s decision on poppy cultivation is to introduce risk into the planting decision by demonstrating a credible threat of eradication.  Governor - led eradication campaigns throughout their provinces, along with PEP?s publicity campaigns, are working to create this risk.  During the Poppy Cultivation season, PEP provides agricultural specialists to monitor poppy eradication efforts reported by provincial government.  These specialists will work alongside United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and other MCN survey personnel and report their findings back to the MCN and international community.  During the off-season, these same PEP specialists work in the rural areas to influence pre-planting decisions by farmers, monitor their planting intentions for the following season, and build up knowledge of land use and ownership patterns throughout the province.

D.	Minimum Qualifications

1.	Bachelor?s degree from a accredited institution, or equivalent experience may be substituted (i.e., Associates degree with five years related experience, or ten years of related experience in public administration).
2.	Must be an U.S. citizen, subject to Department of State security clearance.  Current or former national agency check desired.
3.	Familiarity with Embassy organization and management procedures and Embassy interrelated activities, as well as knowledge of programs, organization, and operations of other USG elements making up the U.S. Mission, which are involved in counter-narcotics programs, particularly the military, is required.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. The Office of Grants and Training (G&T) is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy assessment of personal decontamination kits (PDKITS) to validate their employment and effectiveness when used by emergency responders in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or other hazardous environments.

G&Ts Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) is inviting manufacturers to provide information on PDKITS used in emergency response situations for self or assisted-aid decontamination in the event emergency response personnel inadvertently become contaminated upon arrival at a WMD or other hazardous incident. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Authorized Equipment List (AEL) item number for this equipment is 8.1.1. The requested information will be included in the personal decontamination kit market research, will provide available product information, and will provide support information for the CDP PDKITS focus group and assessment.

The intent of the user assessment program will be to provide the emergency response community with feedback on equipment based on utilization in scenarios that replicate, to the maximum extent possible, conditions that could be experienced in incident response. The results of the assessment will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the CDP endorse any product or manufacturer.

The assessment will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from the emergency response population, representative of responder disciplines in agencies and jurisdictions across the US. These evaluators will be actual users of the equipment in the field. The evaluators will be presented with specific scenarios and tasks to be carried out using the PDKITS. The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluated criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator. Some of the criteria could include capability, usability, affordability, deployability, and maintainability.

If you wish to provide information about your particular brand/product, please provide in electronic (MSWord) format your company name, whether you are a manufacturer or a distributor, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, web address, and email address. Additionally, please provide product literature along with any information available such as the adaptability of the equipment in hazardous environments, reliability, maintainability, durability, environmental limits, safety reports, latest research, and new developments. Also, please include cost information such as initial costs, replacement parts, accessory options, and available warranties.

Do not send your piece of equipment. Selected equipment will be purchased from distributors/suppliers as the equipment is selected for the assessment.

Respond by 4:00 p.m. CST, December15, 2006, by e-mail to Charlotte.Laughlin@dhs.gov or Ella.Chapman@dhs.gov; fax to (256) 847-2323; or mail to Charlotte Laughlin, Contract Specialist, Center for Domestic Preparedness, P. O. Box 5100, Anniston, AL 36205-0100.

<DESC>Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is fabricating the National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX), a fusion energy research device that will be located at PPPL in Plainsboro, New Jersey. PPPL seeks expressions of interest, technical comments and budgetary estimates from firms interested in the fabrication of six (6) large poloidal field (PF) electromagnets for NCSX. As currently envisioned, two (2) each magnets of three (3) differing sizes and configurations (PF4, PF5 and PF6) will be required. The magnets will be wound in a conventional round geometry, pancake configuration, with close attention to stated tolerances and cleanliness of the fabrication environment. To simplify manufacture and reduce costs, all three coil types will use the same rectangular-cross section, hollow core copper conductor, glass taped and vacuum impregnated. The finished coils will vary in size from approximately 48.6 inches O.D. (PF4), to 178.9 inches O.D. (PF5), to 216.3 inches O.D. (PF6).  The approximate finished weights of the coils are: 1,792.4 lbs. (PF4); 3,326.7 lbs. (PF5); and 1,883.0 lbs. (PF6).   Preliminary drawings of all three coils are available for viewing and download at the PPPL Procurement Division web site, http://oorm-1.pppl.gov/public/procurement/. Currently, PPPL expects to release a request for proposals (RFP) for these coils in June 2007, with   award of a firm fixed price (FFP) contract in August 2007 and delivery of all coils complete by December 2007.  Firms interested in supplying this requirement are requested to provide written expressions of interest to PPPL.  The response should include: complete contact information (firm name, address, representative name and telephone/fax/email); a statement of the firm?s experience in the manufacture of coils of similar size and configuration, including customer names and dates of delivery; a statement of the firm's ability to meet required tolerances and use required manufacturing procedures, and its ownership of, or access to, a suitable clean room assembly environment; comments (if any) concerning the adequacy and suitability of the preliminary drawings for fabrication; and a non-binding budgetary estimate of the cost to manufacture each coil. Responses may be sent by letter, fax or email to the address indicated below. This announcement is not a request for quotations or proposals, and firms will not be reimbursed for costs incurred to respond to this announcement.

<SUBJECT>D--A76 Study of FDA's OITSS
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) to (1) provide follow-up information to the Public Announcement and (2) solicit comments, suggestions, best practices, and lessons learned regarding the acquisition of IT Desktop Personal Computer services on a seat management basis, (3) provide interested parties a draft of the Performance Work Statement for their comments, suggestions and other general feedback and (4) solicit input on several other elements of general interest to the FDA in regards to overall scope of this effort. 

1.	Follow-Up to Public Announcement

a.	The Study Schedule is currently as follows: 

OFFICE OF IT SHARED SERVICES STUDY 
STUDY TASK	                START	               FINISH
Public Announcement	        September 15, 2006
Performance Work Statement	September 15, 2006  March 9, 2007
Agency Tender Development	September 15, 2006  June 5, 2007

Performance Decision Announced	January 14, 2008
Transition Period	        February 2008	    TBD
Start of 1st Performance Period 	            TBD

b.	The current number and location of OITSS FTEs is listed on Attachment 1. 

c.	There are approximately 155 on-site contractors directly supporting the functions listed in the Public Announcement.  All of these contract personnel are located in the Metropolitan District of Columbia area.

2.	Desktop Hardware Management Services Provided on a Seat Management basis
Background: The FDA is in the process of conducting an OMB A-76 competitive sourcing study of the operations, maintenance and management of its IT regulatory network and related support infrastructure.  As part of the study, the FDA is interested in the advisability of writing the eventual solicitation with the option of performing selected tasks on a seat management basis.   These selected tasks are desktop hardware procurement, receipt, storage, provisioning, delivery, installation, pickup, disposal and refresh.  If, based on responses to this RFI and other considerations, seat management is judged to be an option that is in the best interest of the FDA, the competitive sourcing solicitation may ask for a priced option for performing the selected desktop tasks on a seat management basis (Service Provider furnished hardware).   
 
Request:  All interested parties are requested to provide answers to the following questions plus any comments, suggestions, or other beneficial information that the FDA could use in determining whether to structure the solicitation to include seat management.  
1.	Have you ever provided the selected scope of desktop management services as mentioned above on a seat management basis?  If so, please provide the following information.
a.	Brief description of the environment including number of seats served, and types of Service Level Agreements, and technologies used.
b.	Identification of tasks that are provided off-site versus on-site.
2.	In your experience, how effective has it been to provide the desktop services contemplated in this solicitation on a seat management in terms of:
a.	Cost efficiency and control?
b.	Higher customer satisfaction?
c.	Increased operational efficiency?
3.	Are there any other seat management services you would add to achieve further economies of scale and a commensurately lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or to improve system performance and/or customer satisfaction at the same TCO?
4.	In your experience, what would be the average per seat cost of the selected desktop tasks identified above based on customer and workload information in draft PWS?  Discuss factors contributing to cost increases or decreases in this type of a managed services environment?
5.	What is the minimum term of a seat management contract for PCs that would allow the new IT service provider to convert to seat management without increasing FDA?s IT expenditures?
6.	From your experience, what are the best practices for phasing-in or transitioning to seat management and how would these be effectively addressed in a possible solicitation?

3.	Draft Performance Work Statement
The attached PWS is an early draft and does not include all workload or performance standards that will be provided.  The FDA is releasing this PWS as part of the RFI to encourage interaction between the FDA?s PWS team and the parties interested in the competitive sourcing study.  The intent of this interaction is to help shape the eventual solicitation so that it meets FDA?s long term requirements in a manner which is compatible with the best practices of potential offerors.  As you review the PWS, bear in mind that it is purposefully written as a performance-based document. Thus, it attempts to describe the service or output required without overly specifying how that service or output is to be accomplished.  In some cases, the full description of the desired service is incomplete.  Your input is requested in order to identify the salient elements necessary to fully understand the requirement and price it realistically.   

4.	Request for General Acquisition Information 
1.	Provide specific comments on the performance standards included in the Performance Requirement Summary of the attached PWS (Technical Exhibits 1-002 and 1-002B). 
a.	Are they in-line with industry best practices?
b.	Are there any additional or alternative metrics, thresholds, etc. that you would recommend (please provide rationale)
c.	Are there any price/performance trade-off implications that result in higher costs with diminishing return on performance?
2.	Please describe the type(s) of contract vehicles that your company has used to provide these types of services in the manner described in the attached.  
3.	What are the key cost elements, e.g., geographical location vs hardware specification, which tend to drive a vendor?s cost proposal in response to a solicitation for the services described above?
4.	What would you estimate to be the per cent increase in marginal cost of Tier I services (on-site desktop service of reported problems) if that service was expanded to 24/7 for all locations?


Please submit no more than 20 total single-sided pages of response.  

Interested parties should submit their responses to the RFI to the Contracting Officer, Lisa O?Neill, through electronic mail, at lisa.oneill@fda.hhs.gov, no later than December 21, 2006.  

This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB), a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice.  All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this notice will not be returned or published.  Questions submitted as part of your response will not be answered.  The FDA will respond formally to vendor questions when a solicitation is officially released.

<DESC>In responding to this notice, please refer to “Mobile WiMax for Airportal Wireless Communications.” Send information/literature/qualification statement no later than December 29, 2006 to the e-mail or postal address as provided herein.  NASA does not intend to award a contract based on this information.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and to allow industry the opportunity to provide technical information relative to the goals set forth below. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information about the experimental application of Mobile WiMax capability (that is, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, 802.16-2005 [802.16e] standard) for mobile wireless communications network applications in the airportal environment.  For the purposes of this RFI, the term, airportal, refers to both the airport surface and the near-airport airspace within the terminal maneuvering area.  More specifically, GRC is seeking information from qualified companies about their commercial WiMax systems (one or more base stations and customer premise equipment) that may be: (a) operated in the unlicensed frequency spectrum (e.g. upper U-NII band, 5725 MHz to 5850 MHz); and (b) reconfigured and/or retuned for experimental operation within a specific frequency spectrum allocation currently assigned for aeronautical radionavigation, specifically, 5091 MHz to 5150 MHz.  GRC intends to investigate WiMax systems and components to evaluate the connectivity, performance, capacity, and interference among fixed-fixed, fixed-mobile, and mobile-mobile assets in the airportal environment in the proposed frequency bands.  Eventually, wireless communications network experiments and service demonstrations are anticipated in the areas of: capacity and latency measurements and limitations; link performance and reliability; aircraft movement, obstruction and multipath effects; network availability; IPv6 protocol based experiments; routing failover; security and robustness; QOS and traffic priority. GRC intends to obtain suitable licenses as needed to experiment in those bands requiring licenses. The information received from this RFI will be used by NASA GRC to plan for advanced wireless communications research, experiments and demonstrations relevant to a cooperative agreement between NASA GRC and Sensis Corporation for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) Test Bed.  The geographically dispersed NGATS CNS Test Bed is under development in the greater Cleveland Ohio area, with sites at NASA GRC, Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, Burke Lakefront Airport and Lorain County Regional Airport, and remote connectivity with Sensis facilities in East Syracuse New York.    Qualified providers are considered to be those U.S. commercial entities that manufacture systems and components (e.g. base stations, customer premise equipment, antennas) compliant with the IEEE 802.16e standard and are certified by the WiMAX Forum.	Qualified providers are requested to provide information that describes the capabilities of their currently available systems and components as well as near-term enhancements that may be of potential benefit to aeronautical mobile communications in the airport and airspace nearest the airport.  Interested companies are invited to submit concepts for experimentation, demonstrations. Specific information is requested on the following: •	Date of availability and cost of both Access Point (AP) and Subscriber Station (SS) equipment in the specified bands. •	Ability of equipment to employ the full range of the 802.16e OFDMA specifications, including novel features such as MIMO and turbo coding. •	Channel bandwidths and duplexing methods available with equipment. •	802.16e system failure mode analysis and performance estimates. •	Interoperability assessments •	Scalability evaluation •	Remote system/network maintenance, management and monitoring capabilities •	System Specifications including: Radio, Data Communications, Electrical Characteristics, and Physical and Environmental information. Submittal Instructions 1.	Please send relevant literature and information to: E-mail address: David.E.Brooks@grc.nasa.gov NASA-Glenn Research Center Attn: David E.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
   
 (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Offerors will receive an overall rating for each area of evaluation in relation to the non-cost/price and cost/price areas of assessment by the respective evaluation panels. The non-cost/price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price; however, cost/price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. 
 
Selection and Evaluation Criteria: The selection and evaluation criteria for the non-cost/price and cost/price evaluation areas are outlined below. Each area of evaluation will include an assessment of risk (see General Note 7). Offerors are hereby notified that the evaluation factors and major sub factors within each area are identified below. This document contains sufficient evaluation criteria that offerors can draw adequate correlation between the stated evaluation criteria herein and any sub factors that may be evaluated equally for all responsive quotations received. It is essential that offerors furnish the Government with adequate and specific quotations. Cursory responses or responses which merely reiterate or reformulate the Statement of Objectives (SOO) will not be considered as being responsive to this solicitation. 
 
Offerors are advised that any evaluation sub factors receiving a ?Marginal? or ?Unsatisfactory? rating may have a disproportionate negative impact on the overall factor rating and/or risk assessment.  Any quotes failing to offer a solution to one or more sub factors may be deemed not to have met the minimum mandatory requirements and may be eliminated from further consideration. Any offeror eliminated from further consideration will be notified as soon as practicable by the Contracting Officer. 
 
Area of Evaluation: Non-Cost/Price Factors: 
 
Factor:  Technical Solution and Management Approach: The evaluation of an offeror?s Technical Solution and Management Approach shall be based on the offeror?s demonstrated ability to accomplish the requirements identified in the SOO in a timely, comprehensive, and successful manner. In addition, the Government will assess the offeror?s understanding of the SOO and Government objectives. Offerors should clearly describe their ability to achieve or exceed the required performance standards, establish quality assurance and maintain quality control and display their ability to manage The Analysis of Biomedical Samples. 
 
Sub factor:  Quality Assurance and Quality Control: Evaluation of the offeror?s proposed quality assurance and quality control plan and/or procedures shall assess the degree to which the offeror?s planned quality assurance and quality control planned approach demonstrates their ability to successfully ensure proper completion of all required or proposed objectives. Offeror?s should include a description and method, including automated tools, reconcilable reports, and/or manual reports by which the requirements identified within the SOO and Government?s stated objectives will be achieved or exceeded. 
 
Factor:  Past Performance and Past Experience: The Government will evaluate both an offeror?s ?Past Performance,? which relates to how well a contractor performs on projects, and its ?Past Experience,? which relates to whether or not the contractor has performed the same or similar work. The Government considers past performance and past experience as key indicators for predicting future performance.  Offerors with absence or no past performance history will not be disqualified; however; past performance is a critical factor in this solicitation. Offerors with no recent or relevant performance history will receive a neutral rating in this area of evaluation. A neutral rating could be considered less favorable than a favorable past performance score. 
 
Sub factor:  Past Performance: For the purpose of evaluation of past performance, offerors shall define their business arrangements and relationships such as joint ventures, teaming partners (arrangements) and major subcontractors. Each offeror will be evaluated on its relevant performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products and or services. The Government?s evaluation will include, but is not be limited to: 
 
Timeliness of Performance: The offeror shall be evaluated on meeting milestones, reliability, responsiveness to technical direction, timely completion of objectives, and adherence to contract schedules, including contract administration. 
 
Cost Control and Effectiveness: The offeror shall be evaluated on the ability to operate at or below budget for the contract and/or individual contracts, relationship of negotiated costs to actual costs, submission of reasonably priced change proposals, and providing current, accurate and complete billings. 
 
Customer Satisfaction: The offeror shall be evaluated on satisfaction of the technical monitors with the required deliverables, including quality and reporting requirements. 
 
Past Performance Information (PPI) identified in the PPI Questionnaire (see Attachment 1) will be used to collect this information. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in the evaluation of the offeror?s past performance. Additionally, information found in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) may be utilized. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of an offeror?s past performance information in the evaluation. If the offeror does not have relevant past performance information or no past performance information, the offeror will be given a rating which is neither favorable nor unfavorable for this factor. It should be noted that if the Governments attempts at gathering and verifying the offeror?s past performance information fails and the offeror has been notified and not been able to correct this problem, the offeror will be given a rating which is neither favorable nor unfavorable for this factor. 
 
Area of Evaluation: Cost/Price Factors: 
 
The Government will conduct an appropriate cost/price analysis to determine whether the proposed cost/price is fair and reasonable. Cost or price becomes more significant between offers as the evaluated non-cost/price quotations of offerors reach equality (see General Note 2). 
 
Factor:  Cost Realism and Completeness: The Government will evaluate the degree to which the offeror?s proposed total cost/price is realistic for the work to be performed, reflects a clear understanding of the requirements, and if the offeror?s cost/price quotation is consistent with the various elements of the offeror?s technical proposal, considering the required level of effort. The offeror?s cost/price quotation will also be evaluated for completeness or responsiveness in addressing all Government requirements and/or proposed solutions. Cost/price must be submitted in sufficient detail to allow traceability and a complete analysis and evaluation of all firm-fixed elements. 
 
Offerors cost/price quotations will be compared against all aspects of the technical proposal and the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) to aid in determining cost/price reasonableness. Areas to be considered will include, but not be limited to: clarity of proposed cost/price elements, cost increases and/or decreases (over runs and/or under runs), experience on previous and/or current contracts, past/present cost savings and variation of cost/price as it relates to the IGCE, historical data and/or current market analysis. 
 
Factor:  Cost Reasonableness: Degree to which offeror?s proposed total cost/price is reasonable, considering proposed firm-fixed prices. The cost reasonable evaluation will take into consideration the results of the cost realism analysis and overall cost reasonableness based upon the total proposed prices and the degree to which the offeror?s proposed costs/prices indicate a clear understanding of and sound approach to meeting the objectives and requirements of this solicitation. The Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superior performance prospects of any quotation. 
 

The Government does not anticipate the need to request additional information after the closing date of the RFQ; however, clarifications and/or discussions may be required. Offerors should identify within their cost/price quotation and technical proposal, the appropriate point of contact(s) should clarifications or discussions become required. 
 
Late Quotation Provision: In order for your quotation to be considered for award by the Government, your quotation must be received by the Contracting Officer at the place and time specified, or it will be considered late and handled in accordance with FAR 15.208. 
 
FAR provisions and clauses: The provision at FAR 52.212-1 ?Instructions to Offerors--Commercial? applies to this acquisition. Offerors are to include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 ?Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items? with their response. The following FAR clauses also apply: 52.212-4 ??Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items?, 52.212-5 ?Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items?, with the following clauses cited in 52.212-5 being applicable to this acquisition: 52.219-6 ?Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside?, 52.222-3 ?Convict Labor?, 52.222-21 ?Prohibition of Segregated Facilities?, 52.222-26 ?Equal Opportunity?, 52.222-35 ?Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans?, 52.222-36 ?Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities?, 52.222-37 ?Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans?, 52.225-13 ?Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases?, and 52.232-33 ?Payment of Electronic Funds Transfer ? Central Contractor Registration? and 52.232-34 ?Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer ? Other than Central Contractor Registration?. The aforementioned provision and clauses can be accessed electronically at http://www.arnet.gov/far  and http://www.gsa.gov/far  . Prospective sources are reminded that award can only be made to a Contractor who is registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. 

Note 1: The Government reserves the right to amend or cancel this solicitation and issue a new solicitation with respect to any individual item in the event quotations received and the Government's requirements indicate that alternative services, technical approaches or different quantities of services should be acquired. 
 
Note 2: Cost/price is a substantial evaluation criterion and offerors are hereby notified that upon an in-depth technical evaluation, appropriate scores will be assigned in non-price/non-cost areas. Cost/price scores will be assigned by formula. The lowest acceptable proposed cost/price to the Government will receive the highest cost/price score. The higher proposed costs/prices will receive proportionately lower scores. After adding each offeror's scores for cost/price and other areas, award will be made to the offeror which receives the highest total weighted score. However, the Government reserves the right to examine the technical point scores to determine whether a point differential between offerors represents any actual significant difference in technical merit. If it does not, then award may be made to an offeror with a lower cost or priced quotation, even though its total weighted point score is lower. Additionally, all offerors are hereby notified that an acceptable quotation with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher-priced quotation provides the Government a greater overall benefit. 
 
Note 3: The Government intends to award without discussions and reserves the right to award a contract immediately following the conclusion of the evaluation of initial offers without clarifications, discussions or negotiations if determined in the best interest of the Government by the Contracting Officer. Therefore, it is critical that each offeror be fully responsive to the solicitation, its provisions and submits its best quotation initially. 
 

Note 4: Proposal and/or quotation information submitted may be used to assess other areas of evaluation regarding cost/price and/or non-price factors. 
 
Note 5: Non-price factors will be reviewed to determine consistency with cost/price factors and to assess the offeror?s understanding of the overall project as outlined in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). 
 
Note 6: Each offeror should strive to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government that the offeror has provided a technical solution and management approach that will ensure successful performance of all objectives as identified in the SOO and Government objectives. 
 
Note 7: The Government will conduct an assessment of risk for all quotations received. Risk is defined as the likelihood that the Offeror?s proposed solution would successfully meet the requirements identified in the SOO. Evaluation of the Offeror?s ability to mange risks shall be demonstrated by detailing how each of the risks associated with this NHRC objective can be mitigated through corrective actions, work around alternatives, scheduling, program management alternatives, scheduling, costing, trending, impacts, etc. Risk will be evaluated throughout the evaluation process and will include but not be limited to considerations of management actions, company policies, knowledge and specific experience in the development, testing, and analysis of compounds contained within antioxidant micronutrients, regulations, policies, and/or procedures and any other method by which the offeror is able to demonstrate its ability to manage risks and reduce the impacts and/or costs to the Government. In addition, any identified risk within any aspect of an Offeror?s proposed solution will be analyzed as to its potential impact and/or cost to the NHRC mission and Government. 
 
Government objectives: The following are descriptions of each objective, to include minimum project requirements. 

Part III ? Statement of Objectives (SOO): 
 
Overall Program Objectives: The Government is seeking qualified firms to provide the analysis of blood samples for the indicators of oxidative stress and inflammatory response for the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC).
