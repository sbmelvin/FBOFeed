<DESC>This is&nbsp;the final solicitation&nbsp;for the&nbsp;acquisition of a Transportation Management Service (TMS) for the U.S. General Services Administration.
<p>GSA's Center for Transportation Management (QMCC) offers freight and household goods transportation services for federal civilian agencies. GSA is the sole agency mandated to procure and negotiate transportation rates on behalf of all Federal civilian agencies. GSA's solicitation and acceptance of rates and charges provide highly competitive pricing, which in many cases includes the solicitation and acceptance of rates specific to an agency's facility and shipping characteristics. GSA offers several programs to support the transportation needs of the Government.</p>
<p>Freight Management Program (FMP): FMP provides a framework for fulfilling the domestic freight shipping requirements of Federal agencies. GSA's Standard Tender of Service establishes a uniform basis for buying freight transportation through its rules and accessorial services. The program offers rate management services nationally for general commodity freight transportation.</p>
<p>Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program (CHAMP): GSA's Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program (CHAMP) assists relocating Federal Government employees in transporting household goods from one official duty station to another, both domestically and internationally. CHAMP stipulates provisions for transporting household goods, privately owned vehicles, and unaccompanied air baggage.</p>
<p>Currently, the transportation options are accessed through GSA's internet based Transportation Management Services Solution (TMSS).</p>
<p>QMCC's goal is to become the "provider of choice" for all transportation needs across the Federal Government and create a contemporary world-class portfolio program that consistently meets the needs of the Federal community. In order to support this goal, QMCC is acquiring a streamlined, adaptable world-class Transportation Management Service (TMS) that continually applies commercial best practices to realize transportation efficiencies and deliver a transparent, accountable, and sustainable service that yields exceptional customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>The overriding objectives for TMS are total cost savings for transportation spending for the Federal Government, industry best practices in transportation procurement, execution and visibility and advanced management reporting offered on a highly scalable platform. TMS will ensure the delivery of user friendly, customer-centric, configurable, policy-compliant, reliable, and secure Federal transportation management service using a contractor-owned, hosted, and operated model, e.g., an Application Service Provider (ASP) or Software as a Service (SaaS). The TMS provider will foster an environment of Government-wide collaboration among all parties to include all Federal agencies, all approved Transportation Service Providers (TSP) and GSA. <br /><br />QMCC seeks to identify 'one solution' to support all of its needs. Any contract resulting from the Statement of Work (SOW) will provide for a TMS that improves usability, advanced functionality, accessibility, performance, reporting and security.</p>
<p>Full operational capability is expected by January 2012.</p>
<p>The contract type&nbsp;will be a Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract. The Period of Performance is expected to be for a two (2) year Base&nbsp;Period, with&nbsp;four 2-year options to renew. This procurement is not a Set-Aside for Small Business concerns. However, all qualified Small Business concerns are encouraged to submit offers. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541519 and the size standard to be considered a Small Business is $25M in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>All offerors must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration System (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. Offerors must also complete Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Large businesses will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan. Offers must be in English and U.S. Dollars. <br /><br />THIS IS THE FINAL SOLICITATION - PROPOSALS ARE DUE FEBRUARY 17, 2011 NO LATER THAN 2:00 P.M., EASTERN TIME.</p>
