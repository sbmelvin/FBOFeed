GFSC currently uses the IT Change Control Broad (ITCCB) BAseline approval list for server specifications.  http://enm.irm.state.gov/IT_CCB/Baselines/Hardware/hwbaseline_servers.html  We currently have a server farm with all Hewlett Packard (HP) servers similar to the server erquested above and they all fit into our current rack space/configuration.  Substitutions may cause problems with space and compatibility. It would be safer to stay in the Hewlett Packard family of servers from a prior generation than to go with a brand/server that has never been on the approved list. Since GFSC already has a farm of HP servers, when we order new servers, we also order parts/drives that are interchangeable, allowing for greater redundancy and potential uptime. This allows for a single set of spare parts for maintenance which helps control costs and a single vendor point of contact for onsite maintenance thereby reducing administrative and operational overhead when maintenance is required. . . .<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA LARC has a requirement for maintenance of and developmental changes to thelaser transmitters in the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) I and II instruments. The HSRL instruments are designed to measure aerosol extinction at 355 and 532 nm,aerosol backscatter and depolarization at 355, 532, and 1064 nm.  The laser transmitterconsists of a Pump Laser and a Nonlinear Optics Module for the generation of UVwavelengths.  The Pump Laser is injection-seeded and tunes to the seed frequency for eachlaser shot using the ramp-and-fire technique.  It builds on heritage established underthe CALIPSO satellite lidar program.   It is designed using a custom architecturesuitable for use in space (e.g., ruggedized, conductively cooled, sealed to maintain 1atmosphere pressure). The HSRL instrument currently has two configurations; HSRL-I andHSRL-II.  The HSRL instruments are primarily flown on field missions used to validatemeasurements made by the other spaceborne lidar as well as aerosol retrievals fromsatellite-based passive sensors.  NASA intends to award a sole source contract to Fibertek, Inc., Herndon, VA under theauthority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  The HSRL instrumentconsists of a Laser Transmitter, a Laser Receiver and various associated components.  TheFibertek Laser is the core of the Laser Transmitter; it is this core that will requiremaintenance to support the day to day HSRL mission and developmental changes to thepulsed laser system aimed at enhancing the performance of the HSRL instrument.	  TheHSRL pulsed laser system was developed by Fibertek. The system is a one-of-a-kind pulsedlaser system that was developed specifically to address HSRL science requirements. Thissystem represents a technical extension beyond the current industry state-of-the-art, andcontains significant intellectual property and proprietary data this is not availableoutside of Fibertek, Inc.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice of a proposed construction project for the Army National Guard in Connecticut.  This project is located in East Haven Connecticut and is a modernization of an exisiting firing range.  The esitmated magnitude of this project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.  A bid bond will be required for this project with your proposal in the amount of 20% of the proposed price or $3,000,000 whichever is less.  Performance and Payment bonds will be required for the full amount (100%) of the awarded contract price before Notice to Proceed will be issued.  The solicitation will be available on or about 1 June 2009 and responses will be due on or about 15 July 2009.  The solicitation, when issued shall establish the official opening and closing dates and times.  This solicitation will be issued as a firm fixed price sealed bid which will result in a single award.  The estimated period of performance for completion of construction is 540 calendar days form the date of notice to proceed.  At this time no pre-solicitation conference is planned for this project.  The date and time of any future conference will be published on this portal.  The description of the work to be performed is as follows:  1. Project Title and Purpose<BR>The project title is Combat Pistol/Military Police Qualification Course (CP/MPQC) and 25 Meter Zero Range. The primary purpose of this project is to construct a Combat Pistol/Military Police Qualification Course and a 25 Meter Zero Range (25M ZERO) at the East Haven Rifle Range in East Haven, Connecticut.<BR>As stated in the TC 25-8 and the Range Design Guides for each range:<BR>The CP/MPQC is a dual purpose facility and is used 1) to train and test soldiers on the skills necessary to detect, identify, engage, and defeat stationary personnel targets in a tactical array and 2) to provide realistic and effective Military Police (MP) marksmanship training with 9mm, .38 caliber, and .45 caliber pistols.<BR>The 25M Zero Range is used to train individual soldiers on the skills necessary to align the sights and practice basic marksmanship techniques against stationary targets. The range is designed for training Shot-Grouping and Zeroing exercises with the M16 and M4 series rifles as well as crew served machine guns. In addition the 25M Zero Range will also be used as an Alternate Range to satisfy the training requirements of a Modified Record Fire (MRF) Range as permitted in Table A-1 of the TC 25-8. The MRF Range is used to train and test individual soldiers on the skills necessary to identify, engage and defeat stationary infantry targets for day/night qualification requirements with the M16 and M4 series rifles.<BR>2. Project Need The requirement for this project as stated in the DD 1391 states that the facility is required to perform marksmanship qualification for Army personnel. 3. Scope of Project<BR>CP/MPQC Primary Features<BR>A standard CP/MPQC is comprised of a 15 lane facility. Due to space limitations, an 8 lane CP/MPQC will be constructed. The CP/MPQC will consist of the following:<BR>" 8 Firing Lanes<BR>" 56 Stationary Infantry Targets<BR>" 8 Stationary Silhouettes (booted, MP Qualification)<BR>25M ZERO Primary Features<BR>A standard 25 Meter Zero Range consists of 32 rifle zero lanes. A standard Modified<BR>Record Fire (MRF) Range consists of 16 firing lanes. Due to site space limitations, the MRF Range must be a Fully Contained Outdoor Range that eliminates the need for a Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) for escaping ricochets. Since a fully contained, full size MRF Range (320 meters by 300 meters)is cost prohibitive, a 16-lane, fully contained, 25-Meter Zero Range will be used to satisfy the MRF Range training requirements. The 25M Zero Range will consist of the following:<BR>A. 25-Meter Zero (M16, M4 and Medium Machine Gun - 5.56 and 7.62 mm)<BR>" 16 Target frames at 25m<BR>" 16 Target frames at 10m<BR>" 16 V-notch rifle rest pegs<BR>The Associated Range Operations and Control Facilities are:<BR>Ammunition Breakdown Buildings (3)<BR>Bleacher Enclosure (1)<BR>Control Towers (2)<BR>The project work includes grading and drainage, roads, parking areas, walk paths and<BR>utilities.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology, Material Science and Engineering Laboratory, requires a custom vacuum chamber to satisfy agency and measurement apparatus requirements and  ensure compatibility of components, both included in the quotations to be submitted in response to this Request for Quotation and with NIST-owned items.  The items being procured are components necessary to construct an apparatus capable of high temperature thermoelectric property metrology.  High temperature means 300-1300 Kelvin.   

A small custom vacuum chamber, fitted with multiple electrical and instrument feedthroughs is required, to connect the measurement equipment to components in the vacuum furnace.  The custom vacuum chamber must be accurately machined to properly mate with a NIST-owned metric water-cooled flange.

The vacuum chamber must include special high tolerance and carefully aligned ports to attach to already procured motion feedthroughs.  It is necessary to have precise alignment of these feedthroughs to properly support and position the sample holder in the furnace.  

The chamber must also contain custom thermocouple feedthroughs comprised of only copper connections and ending in loops.  Copper feedthroughs reduce the uncertainty in measuring temperature from thermocouoples.  The chamber must also include a custom removable front panel with a rectangular view port.

The period of performance shall be eight (8) weeks from the date of award.

This equipment shall be procured using the procedures set forth in FAR Part 13Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.    

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under RFQ number SB1341-09-RQ-0112.  

THE RFQ IS ANTICIPATED FOR RELEASE TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY ON OR ABOUT MARCH 5, 2009, AND WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET AT THE ABOVE WEB SITE.  Required attachments must be requested via e-mail or fax to the Contracting Officer, Carol A. Wood.

POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCESSING THE WEB SITE AND SUBMITTING WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR ATTACHMENTS.  

Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant 
Purchase Order.  

THERE IS NO WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT AVAILABLE, TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED, AND NO BIDDERS LIST WILL BE MAINTAINED. Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via email to Carol.Wood@NIST.GOV.

These response reports would capture what worked well and should be considered for future difficult entangled right whale cases, as well as recommendations for how to improve future responses. NOAA Fisheries Service also seeks tools conceptualized, developed and specially made by Coastwise Consulting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>NOAA Fisheries Service will use the tools to expand and build upon existing disentanglement network response capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the tools will enhance capabilities to cut entangling rope embedded in whales, place flotation devices, and better document on-water events.</span></p>

<DESC>NRCS-Illinois plans to issue a solicitation for a logjam removal Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) project.   The logjams are located on the North Fork of the Embarrass River in the in the Illinois counties of Clark, Crawford, and Jasper.  There are approximately 42 locations with several logjam sites per location.  Access routes to each site will be shown on the plans.  The work typically consists of removal of the logjam and stacking the material on site against existing trees in a manner that will not allow the debris to readily reenter the channel in future flood events.  Some of the debris piles must be burned.  The estimated price range is between $100,000 and $250,000.

To allow potential offerors and opportunity to obtain a better understanding of the work required, a pre-bid conference will be held on April 30, 2009, at 10:00 AM local time at the Crawford County NRCS field office located at 1212 N. Allen Street, Robinson, Illinois.  The group will not tour the sites since the project area is quite large.    

Solicitations will be available at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about April 28, 2009. Any changes to the solicitation will be made only at ww.fedbizopps.gov; it is the responsibility of the contractor to check this web address for any posted changes prior to submitting a bid.  

To be eligible for award, prospective contractors must complete Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport intends to award on a sole source basis a Firm Fixed Price type contract to Cornell University  Laboratory of Ornithology for the lease of (8 ea) autonomous acoustic recording buoys. The Bioacoustics Research Program (BRP) at Cornell has developed an autonomous acoustic recording device, known as a Marine Acoustic Recording Unit (MARU), for deployment on the ocean floor at depths up to 6,000 meters.  Among the crucial features of the MARU are its small size, its low power consumption allowing it to sit alone for weeks or months, and its cost effectiveness for large scale deployment of multiple buoys. It is essential that these buoys be deployable from small boats and easily recovered by an acoustic release mechanism. MARUs are the only recording buoys that meet these specifications and Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology is the only program with this technology, including all supporting services, available for lease.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific (SPAWARSYSCEN Pacific) intends to negotiate asole-source, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with BrandywineCommunications, Tustin, CA for a follow-on contract to N66001-04-D-5002,which expires January 2009. This action will provide both shore and fleet userswith parts and modules for various configurations of the Navy's ruggedizedTime Frequency Distribution System (TFDS).  It will also provide for theprocurement of new TFDS systems for Virginia Class submarines.
Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) andFAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements.  The TFDS is a program of record under thePresident's budget. National Stock Numbers (NSN) have been assigned to allTFDS modules and full life cycle support is provided to all TFDS modules underthis program of record. The use of any other source for this acquisition wouldresult in unacceptable delays because of the logistical burden of implementinga competing system(s) for fielded equipment (e.g. supportability, training,spares, drawings, installation support, etc.). The additional cost ofintroducing acompeting system would not be offset by potential cost savings from acompetitive procurement.  Therefore, it has been determined that BrandywineCommunications is the only source that can perform this effort without eitherunacceptable delays or substantial duplication of costs.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interestedparties may identify their interest and capability to respond to therequirementor submit proposals. Information received will normally be considered solelyforthe purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Adetermination by the Government to compete the proposed contract basedupon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of theGovernment.
The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is334119, and the size standard is 1,000 employees.  The anticipated period ofperformance will be approximately one (1) year with four (4) option periods ofone (1) year each- for a total possible performance period of  five (5) years.The estimated value of the effort is $4.3M. Questions concerning this solesource contract action may be directed to Spencer M. Sessions atspencer.sessions@navy.mil.  Questions and/or responses are due by 1December 2008.

<DESC>The Government anticipates to award a firm fixed price award to Lumistar, LLC , 5870 El Camino Real, Carlsbard, CA  92008. Four Receiver Boards, Part Number LS-25-PBS S Band Receivers with 12 IF Filters are required. This equipment will be used to enhance existing government owned receiver systems.  Lumistar's is the only manufacturer that can provide this equipment due to compatibility issues such as data bus interfacing, software addressing, etc.  No other manufacturer can provide this equipment without performing non-recurring engineering and environmental qualification.  No manufacturers other than Lumistar can provide these receiver boards without being qualified, which represents a substantial duplication of costs that would not likely be recovered through open competition, only Lumistar and no other source will satisfy agency requirements.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be fully considered by the agency.   Point of Contact<BR> is Lisa Starbuck, Contract Specialist, telephone 256-876-3080, email lisa.starbuck@us.army.mil.<BR>

<DESC>The US Army CECOM Contracting Center - Washington announces the issuance of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) sponsored by the U. S. Army Communications-Electronics Command Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Army Power Division.  This announcement provides only a synopsis of the BAA.  The complete BAA including proposal preparation instructions and evaluation criteria is available at the C-E LCMC Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP), https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/.  In order to be able to access the BAA and submit a proposal a contractor must first be registered on the IBOP.  A CAGE Code and DUNS number are required to complete registration for proposal submissions.  A contractor employee who is authorized to bind the contractor must complete the registration.  The process could take several days to finalize the registration and contractors are encouraged to register as soon as possible.<BR><BR>This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  Accordingly, proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and fully compliant with PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  Prospective Offerors should note that this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement.  The cost of proposal preparation for response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment for the effort being acquired.  Potential Offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted contracting officer may obligate the government to an agreement involving the expenditure of Government funds.  Any resultant contract award would include all clauses required by Federal Acquisition Regulations and appropriate supplements.<BR><BR>Environmental Control technology is one of the Army Science and Technology Power and Energy Efforts as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). As part of the Recovery Act, the U.S. Army is interested in supporting research in the area of renewable energy, specifically for the co-generation of cooling, heating, and power from waste heat sources. Waste heat sources may include but are not limited to diesel engine exhaust gases, engine cooling fluids, and ambient airstreams.  Goals of the development include advanced technology demonstration for commercial and military applications, miniaturization of components, and thermodynamic cycle enhancement for improved energy efficiency, with associated development of innovative thermal system components. The U.S. Army is interested in receiving white papers followed by proposals for 12 to 18 month programs in basic and applied research, development, and demonstration of small, lightweight, efficient environmental control technology for use in various applications in capacities ranging from 6 kBTUh to 120 kBTUh. The technology shall operate within an ambient air temperature from 0 to +125 degrees Fahrenheit. Proposals that show the greatest potential to fully-address one or both topics while simultaneously creating or retaining the greatest number of jobs are preferred. <BR><BR>Topic A:  Absorption Co-generation - One developmental approach is absorption cycle waste heat co-generation.  Advanced technology demonstration of state-of-the-art commercial absorption technology is desired with emphasis on overall system efficiency.  Advanced technology demonstration of military unique configurations is highly desired with emphasis on equipment mobility, compact and lightweight design, refrigerant safety (non-flammable, lower toxicity refrigerant pairs), and compatibility with military standard diesel generator systems (http://www.pm-mep.army.mil/technicaldata/index.htm) as a source of waste heat for initial demonstration. Laboratory investigations and focused research of absorption cycle enhancements are encouraged with continuing emphasis on seeking technology breakthroughs leading to more compact lighter weight absorption designs. <BR><BR>Topic B:  Other Co-generation - Other developmental approaches to co-generation of cooling, heating, and power from waste heat sources are also highly desired, with emphasis on laboratory investigation and studies of thermodynamic cycles and development of innovative thermal system components for application to future advanced technology demonstrators. Advanced technology demonstration of military unique configurations is desired, with emphasis on equipment mobility, compact and lightweight design, refrigerant safety (non-flammable, lower toxicity), and compatibility with military standard diesel generator systems as a source of waste heat for initial demonstration. Research and development of improved environmental control system components such as heat exchangers, fans, motors, thermal expansion and fluid mixing devices, electronic controls, pumps, and compressors are acceptable. To the extent that component development is based on vapor compression refrigeration cycle technology, research thrusts must clearly demonstrate linkage to waste heat recovery mechanisms, and any such vapor compression refrigerant to be investigated must be environmentally friendly, to include zero Ozone Depleting Potential (ODP) and zero or very low Global Warming Potential (GWP) and may include natural refrigerants. <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the overall budget available for award under this BAA is approximately $6M.  The Government expects to make multiple awards spread over multiple technologies as a result of this BAA.  It is anticipated that awards for a proposal covering a single topic (Topic A or Topic B, as specified in Part II of this BAA) will not exceed $1.5M.  Awards for proposals covering both topics (Topic A and Topic B) will not exceed $3M.   The proposed period of performance for the proposed effort, whether addressing one or both topics, shall NOT exceed 18 months.   All potential offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas can change with little or no notice.<BR><BR>White paper submissions must be submitted no later than 12noon EDST on 15 May 2009.  It is anticipated that Offerors will be notified of selection/non-selection for full proposal submission by 28 May 2009 and full proposal submission (if selected) will be required by 18 June 2009.<BR><BR>This BAA is intended for the development of research efforts in support of the RDEC Army Power Division.  Specific information on program goals is provided in the following section, Program Description.  In order for any proposals to be considered, the proposed effort MUST meet the definition of basic or applied research and development found at FAR 35.001.  Submission of White Papers is mandatory prior to submission of a full proposal.  The selection of one or more proposals for award will be based on a peer and scientific evaluation of each Offerors response (to include both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.<BR><BR>White Papers/Proposals shall be submitted in the format set forth in the BAA (see complete BAA at Army Single Face to Industry Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP), URL https://abop.monmouth.army.mil) in electronic format via the IBOP.  The IBOP submittal shall include an electronic signature by an individual having authority to enter into a contract.  In order to be able to access the RFP and submit a proposal a contractor must first be registered on the IBOP.  A CAGE Code and DUNS number are required to complete registration for proposal submissions.  A contractor employee who is authorized to bind the contractor must complete the registration.  The process could take several days to finalize the registration and contractors are encouraged to register as soon as possible. <BR><BR>Proposals shall be submitted in the format set forth in the BAA (see complete BAA at IBOP) in electronic format via the IBOP via electronic media using Microsoft Office 2000 products (i.e., Microsoft  Word and Excel, and Adobe Acrobat version 4.0), in separate files for each proposal volume as set forth below. All information pertaining to a particular volume shall be confined to that file.  A cover letter shall be provided to include a short summary of the whitepaper (and subsequently the full proposal), and other information as set forth in the BAA.<BR><BR>There will be no formal request for proposal or any further solicitation document issued in regard to this BAA.  Therefore, interested parties should be alert for any amendments that maybe published.  Amendments to this BAA will be issued through the Army Single Face to Industry Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.     <BR><BR>Offerors shall not submit questions related to this BAA electronically using the Question format available in the Army IBOP BAA - Recovery and Reinvestment for Smaller, Lighter Co-Generation and Absorption Environmental Control Technologies solicitation folder.

Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division is interested in receiving proposals/ white papers which offer potential for advancement and improvement of Targeting Accuracy Systems.  There is an urgent need for components or systems capable of improving targeting accuracy.  Current weapon systems are capable of engaging targets with an accuracy that exceeds the limits of the targeting equipment.
Topic Areas of Interest/Objectives:  The following topics are areas of current interest:
Topic: A. Azimuth Sensing System
There is an urgent need for a system capable of improving targeting accuracy.  Current weapon systems are capable of engaging targets with an accuracy that exceeds the limits of the targeting equipment.  Currently only laser designation provides a practical solution to this problem, however, this makes the operator vulnerable to counterattacks. Accurate knowledge of a user location coupled with range, heading, and elevation to target provides a solution where a brief range-finding designation will allow for a targets location to be know well enough to call for a precision strike.
Provide a non-magnetic azimuth sensing system for use on man-portable targeting devices such as laser range finders and laser designators.  This system shall eliminate well known problems with digital magnetic compasses.  This will allow for operation in urban environments, near vehicles, and while wearing body armor. The system will improve on the accuracy of a digital magnetic compass even in good magnetic environments.  Reduce Target Location Error (TLE) to be less than 10m, permitting accurate target location at ranges of 10km from observer to target.
Due to the needs of the user, the system must work inside a building and be small in size.  These limitations rule out the use of all current GPS interferometrics and star finder technologies.  The most promising solutions are currently based on gyro-compassing, however novel ideas are encouraged.
The program goals require objective parameters to be demonstrated within 3 years. The systems characteristic are as follows:
Threshold:a. Man portable fieldable itemb. Less than 1 mil Vertical angle accuracyc. Boresightable to opticsd. Volume less than 0.1 cu fte. 6 mils azimuth accuracyf. 5 lbsg. 500 deg/s survivable slew rate (may need recalibration)h. less than 200 sec startup time
Objective:a. Handheld fieldable itemb. less than 1 mil Vertical angle accuracyc. Boresightable to opticsd. Volume no more than 0.25 cu ine. 1 mils azimuth accuracyf. 0.5 lbsg. 1000 deg/s operational slew rate (without recalibration)h. less than 30 sec startup time
Topic: B. Lightweight Modular Designator

<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Table, Folding Legs and Chair, Folding, Platinum by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7105-00-NIB-0013, Table, Folding Legs 30Wx72Lx29H <br />7105-00-NIB-0015, Chair, Folding, Platinum</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA/FSS Household and Industrial Furniture, Arlington, VA.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Table, Folding Legs and Chair, Folding, Platinum to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>No similar products.</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Table, Folding Legs and Chair, Folding, Platinum to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than COB, Monday, April 27, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC><p>The Department of Education intends to issue a 9 month extension to existing contract ED-01-CO-0040/0009. The current period of performance ends on September 16, 2009. The purpose of the extension is to enable NCES to continue critical discussions with state testing directors and other state policy makers on emerging issues related to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).
<p>On September 16, 2004, The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) awarded contract ED-01-CO-0040/0009 to Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) located in Washington, DC to provide a direct link to chief state school officers through state testing directors and policy-level state staff responsible for state assessments and accountability programs including face-to-face meetings to provide state input on all major changes in NAEP operational processes and special studies, especially those related to exclusion and accommodations of special needs students required the Title 1 regulations on NCLB state report cards, and those related to special studies affecting collection of socioeconomic information and collection of race/ethnicity data according to OMB requirements.<br />The tasks under this project classified into several activities. One activity was to provide logistical support for Assessment Taskforce Meetings so the data can be used in comparing the state performances along with NAEP state assessments and produce reports.</p>
<p>Continuing discussions will include emerging topics but will focus primarily on</p>
<p>&bull;First, a new Trial 12th Grade State Assessment was initiated with eleven states last year with the assessment administered in January - March, 2009. This is the first state 12th grade NAEP assessment during which many of the design features are being field tested for possible expansion to all states in 2013. <br />&bull;Second, the U.S. Department of Education's guidance for states in implementing the new Title I regulations related to NAEP results on state and local school district report cards. <br />&bull;Third, the Secretary of Education and the National Governors Association are calling for benchmarking states against International standards using NAEP and the states' own assessments.</p>
<p>The 9 month extension will allow CCSSO to convene the necessary meetings to assist in describing appropriate interpretations of the data by state-level policy makers, the media and the general public; examine other benchmarking models and, with state input, select the benchmarking methodology that will provide the most accurate, valid International benchmarking of individual state performance.<br />This notice is for informational purposes only. A request for proposal is not required. Interested parties may, however, request further information no later than April 20, 2009 by email to Contract Specialist John Machen at John.Machen@ed.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Physik Instrumente (PI) of Auburn, MA for the purchase of a Vacuum Compatible Nexline Actuator and Controller under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106-(b): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  
The Sole Source determination is based on the need for the Vacuum Compatible Nexline Actuator and Controller to operate in accordance with the original equipment specifications from the manufacturer. 

This component is part of an instrument under construction in the NIST Nanomechanical Properties Group, Ceramics Division. This component is required to provide the coarse approach, and steady hold, of a material under test to a very-high-resolution mechanical probe. 

1.	Vacuum-compatible to a level of not less than 1 x 10-6 torr. 
2.	The actuator must be naturally-clamped. That is, with the actuator de-activated, there must be no slippage or excess motion from the last position achieved. De-activation of the actuator when not in motion stops all heat generation.
3.	The full scale motion of the actuator must be a minimum of 4 millimeters to accommodate different sample sizes and a coarse approach to the measurement.
4.	The actuator must be capable of sub-nanometer (no more than 1 nm) positioning resolution.
5.	The volume and especially height (if actuation is up) must be no more that 60 mm due to space constraints in an existing vacuum chamber.
6.	360-degree access to the test material surface oriented normal to direction of motion. 
7.	Push-pull forces of no less than 30 N so as to actuate a high-stiffness flexure for maximum stability, as well as support externally-applied forces for mechanical testing.

 Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. (EST) on April 28, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to janet.lamb@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-2, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has determined that the procurement of replacement of a 15KV electrical cable located at the VAMC Center, Providence, RI meets the criteria established  for other than full and open competition.  The following information provides support for this position:
1)	Agency:Department of Veterans Affairs830 Chalkstone AvenueProvidence, RI 02908
2)	Nature and description of action being approved:15KV electrical cable transects the footprint of new operating room suites which are under construction.  The duct bank containing this cable was inaccurately shown on existing as-built drawings.  In addition, the duct bank has partially collapsed, exposing a 15 foot section of cable.  The exposed cable represents a serious electrical hazard in its present condition, and failure of the cable would terminate electrical service to approximately 15 essential buildings on the hospital campus.

3)	Description of work required to meet the agency needs:Replacement of approximately 1250' linear feet of electrical cable, along with provision of a 500 KW generator and fuel to provide an alternative source of power while cable is replaced.
4)	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: 	10 USC 2304(c)(2) and FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency"
5)	Determination that proposed contractor's unique qualification of the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:A critical electrical feeder cable was discovered which interfered with the progress of a large, significant construction project.  Replacement of the cable will eliminate the dangerous safety condition while mitigating the need to stop work on the construction project.
6)	Efforts made to solicit from as many sources as practicable including whether or not a notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR Part 5.2Quotes were solicited from three local small businesses specializing in electrical work of this nature.  The government would be seriously injured if the department complied with the time periods specified in FAR Part 5.203.  As a result of the urgency a synopsis is not required.
7)	Contracting Officer's determination that the cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.Past experience with two of the three contractors in previous competitive procurements generated proposals that were fair and reasonable.  Competitive quotes for this procurement will ensure fair and reasonable costs.
8)	Description of the market  research conducted:Previous government procurements for similar work were reviewed to identify prospective contractors.
9)	Other facts supporting the use of other then full and open competition:
a) Exposure of a 15KV cable in a public area presents a serious safety hazard.b) Possible disruption of electrical service to 15 ancillary buildings would severely affect the mission of the medical center if further duct bank collapse occurred.c) Delays in cable replacement would generate a compensable delay claim by the prime construction contractor.
10)	 List of sources expressing interest in writing in the acquisition.HubElectric, Griffin Electric, K Electric
11)	 Actions taken by the Department to remove or overcome barriers to competition:The Department o Veterans Affairs will continue to perform market research and compete all future acquisitions when practicable.
12)	 I certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge:

In addition, continuing questions from offerors indicate there may be ambiguities or other problems in the solicitation's instructions and evaluation criteria that should be addressed. The Contracting Officer has determined that the best course of action is to cancel the solicitation, review the requirement and the solicitation's instructions and evaluation criteria, and reissue a new solicitation within the next 60 days.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA N/A. This is a new requirement. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6 of the FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation) as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  U.S.  Army Dugway Proving Ground, Directorate of Contracting is contemplating the procurement of: (a) CLIN: 0001 1).  This requirement is for the closed system communications at two locations in room 102 in building 4165 for facility control computers.  The contractor shall provide the following:  1) programming and control software that will insure the facility can meet regulatory requirements for normal operations and to insure proper facility capabilities for emergency response and containment; 2) shall participate in building fail safe procedures to insure that control functions and software produce desired results; 3) shall determine the physical limitation and adaptability of existing hardware and control systems to meet regulatory response requirements; and produce detailed drawing and designs for limited capabilities for containment of chambers 100 and 103 to include the false ceiling crawl space and vestibules 105 and 111.  2).  Add facility monitoring and control computers to each chamber observation room to allow direct access to data and warning for emergency response and correction activities.  3).  Develop control set point for chambers 100 and 103 during emergency switch over to backup systems during vapor containment exercise as defined in the Detailed Verification Plan.  FERON will be released and chambers 100 and 103; and adjacent rooms will be monitored for vapor migration until the air handler set points are identified and incorporated as a final in facility control system.  Vapor migration should be zero to less than 1 WPL in any adjacent rooms.  4).  Include in the current control system the ability to control each of the air handlers to the facility control computer to be installed in the chamber monitoring areas.  5).  Establish max and min limits for chamber air handler operation based on mechanical design and parameters to be developed during containment operations as defined in the Detailed Verification Plan, Dated June 2008.  6).  Develop an alarm page for all air handles and hood control phoenix valves in the existing facility computer control system with both visual and audible alarms.  7).  Develop audible and visible alarm parameters for out of tolerance parameters on air handlers and phoenix valves. 8).  Match chambers to insure no pressure differential between chambers 100 and 103; and install pressure monitors between chambers.  Include in facility control computer to include alarms and set point boundaries, both upper and lower to insure chambers remain balanced and do not go beyond upper or lower set points for individual chamber operations.  9).  Insure facility control computer has startup set point priority for each chamber. The exhaust should first come to a predetermined set point and then the makeup air handler should come to predetermined set points.  The default set points have to be established on site in coordination with the facility operator.  10).  Egress area, rooms 105 and 111 for chambers 100 and 103 are required to have a minimum air exchange rate of 4 per hour.  The observed dwell time for vapor in the egress areas is from 2 to 10 hours.  These rooms have to be better ventilated. Task is to analyze the air flow and develop more efficient air exchange rates to allow for proper egress during vapor contamination in the main chambers.  Engineering consultation and design package for the air flow problems is required.  11).  Include monitoring of actual airflow and set point for the Phoenix valves for chambers 100 and 103, to include the associated hoods from the control computer.  12).  Provide printer and print capabilities for the control computer system to facilitate reporting and data distribution of facility operations.  13).  Provide error and event log storage and recovery procedures of the facility computer control system.

Reference the following links for additional information:<br />Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch in 5 CFR Part 2635: <br />2002 CFR Title 5, Volume 3<br />Conflict of Interest laws in Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code: <br />Title 18 United States Code<br />Financial Disclosure requirements in 5 CFR Part 2634: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/5cfr2634_05.html<br />The Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution (See Sec. 9, Clause 8): http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html <br />3 FAM 4120 (Employee Responsibilities Abroad): <br />http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/85177.pdf<br />e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical<br />1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.<br />2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. The Government will reimburse the cost of medevac insurance premiums. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).<br />3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.<br />(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.<br />(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.<br />f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.<br />g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.<br />3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimbursable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.<br />4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br />.<br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.<br />5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.<br />6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.<br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.<br />8) Passport<br />All passports must be valid for the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.<br />h. Social Security, Federal Income Tax and Foreign Earned Income - Applies to only U.S. Citizens and Permanent Resident Aliens of the U.S. subject to U.S. Federal Income and FICA laws.<br />1) As a Personal Service Contract employee, when applicable, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted from salary payments in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.<br />2) As a Personal Service Contract employee, the contractor is not eligible for the "foreign earned income" exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).<br />i. Insurance<br />1) Worker's Compensation Benefits<br />The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.<br />2) Health and Life Insurance.<br />a) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 75% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, excluding costs for private medical evacuation (medevac) insurance, if any, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.<br />b) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 33 1/3% against the actual costs of annual basic life insurance coverage on the same basis as the U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program. Basic life insurance coverage is defined as coverage up to an amount equal to the contractor's annual basic salary rounded up to the next even $1,000 plus $2,000.<br />c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide coverage or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.<br />d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.<br />e) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health and/or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under i. Insurance 1) and/or 2), respectively, of this provision.<br />3) Medevac Coverage<br />a) U.S. Citizens: U.S. citizens who meet the medical clearance requirements are furnished medical evacuation service at no cost.<br />b) Non U.S. citizens do not qualify for government furnished medical evacuation service at no cost and thus will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance. CDC shall reimburse 100% of the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtain coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: <br />http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1215.html<br />CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract. After receipt of an offer letter, the contractor shall furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance and its cost, for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders, in order for CDC to reimburse the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance.<br />j.

Clearances <br />(a) Medical<br />1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.<br />2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.

For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.<br />(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.<br />(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.<br />f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.<br />g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.<br />3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimbursable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.<br />4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above.

<DESC>The National Gallery of Art (hereinafter "Gallery" or "NGA") is soliciting quotes for the purchase of a custom-built DVD/BluRay disk duplicating system ("Duplicator").  The Gallery seeks a proposed solution to their need for duplicating disc-based media in a wide range of formats, and containing content of internal, outside, and international origin.  The Gallery, being a repository of archival media as is the case with many museums, is often called upon to provide access to archived content for public support, educational programming, and scholarly research.  Therefore, there is frequent need for disc duplication in CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray formats, and to accurately reproduce audio, video, imaging, and data file content.

The minimum technical requirements for the Duplicator are:
 Five (5) target burner;
 Minimum 500GB hard drive with computer-grade power supply;
 Free firmware updates available by email, throughout the life of the product;
 Duplication of at least the following standards/zones: CDR, DC-RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD D/L, BRD, BRD D-L, BRD-RW, BRD+RW;
 Toll-free tech support and component warranties for at least six (6) months; and
 One (1) Printer and at least two (2) cartridges for printing labels.
By submitting a quote, vendor certifies that the Duplicator quoted satisfies the above minimum requirements.

Optional features and additional information required to be provided in Vendor's quote:
 Vendor must provide a statement demonstrating responsiveness to firmware updates and quick relay of them to the NGA (I.e. How frequently/quickly will vendor provide updates to the NGA?);
 Provide a list of any additional standards/zones of media that are duplicable, in addition to the minimum types identified above;
 Provide information on any extended warranty/support available for the Duplicator in addition to the minimum six (6) months required;
 Provide a statement describing the speed and efficiency of the duplication process with the build that is quoted, as well as any available options for speed-increasing capabilities; and
 Identify any additional features provided with the quoted Duplicator. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and an additional written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31.

The solicitation documentation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31. FAR provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. FAR 52.212, Evaluation-Commercial Items, is applicable to this acquisition. In addition to Price, the following Technical Factors will be used in evaluating quotes, listed in increasing order of importance: (1) Vendor's Prior Experience and (2) Ability to Provide Maximum Features.  Technical factors will be weighted slightly heavier than price. The vendor submitting (hereinafter the "Vendor) a quote is responsible for providing information in its quote sufficient to allow the Gallery to evaluate the quote using these evaluation factors. Vendors must submit a Firm-Fixed Price, including a breakdown of pricing that, at a minimum, delineates the price for the duplicator with all minimum requirements, with options priced separately.  Vendor shall provide technical documentation for all major components included in the quoted Duplicator.  Furthermore, Vendor shall provide an explanation of why the proposed combination of components would benefit the NGA and provide the NGA with the best value over a different combination of components.  The NGA may use this information in its technical evaluation of proposals.  Vendor shall also provide at least three examples of prior experience building similar custom systems for other clients.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p>The interior working height of the spray application booth should be 46". We need two spray guns and two drum pumps complete with all necessary regulators, gauges, and filters. All other stations should have a minimum working height of 36". All conveyors, lifts, tables, etc. must be capable of sustaining a 500# load. The developer station should have a vacuum pump with 8-foot hose and wand and be exhausted directly to the drain. The parts being inspected are of varied sizes and geometry, some simple and some complicated with voids that would make it difficult to automate the penetrant application process and ensure adequate coverage. Therefore, the application and removal stages will be done manually. The entire line should be shielded by a minimum 36" high backsplash.</p>

Here are some questions that the Navy has recieved and their answers:

Questions:

Voltage Requirement______
Inlet Water Content: _______ ppm
Target Oil Content Out: _______ppm
Oil Discharge Pressure:________psig
Oily Water Source: Bilge, Sump/Tank, Condenser (dryer), or Constant Feed
Suction Head: ______ feet
Controls: Nema 4x Control Box (Standard) or Hazardous Area Class I Div II
(optional)

Answers:

The voltage we will need is 3 Phase 440/480V 60HZ. The Navy does not know
the ppm content of the inlet tanks, but some tanks have just a skim of oil
on the surface, some have 6 inches worth of oil on the surface in 5 feet
worth of water. Target oil content out must be less than 15ppm (regulation).
We want it to be able to filter better to less than 10ppm. Oil discharge
pressure, no requirement. Suction head will be greater than 20 feet, that is
why we will be staging diaphragm pumps to pump into the unit and why we have
the motorized ball valve to control the flow. We only need the standard
control box, we are not working in an explosive enviornment.

Please note that no more questions will be answered after March 18, 2009.

<RESPDATE>042709
<CONTACT>David T Reindl, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-842-6515, Fax 202-312-2792, Email d-reindl@nga.gov
<DESC>The National Gallery of Art (hereinafter "Gallery" or "NGA") is soliciting quotes for the purchase of a custom-built DVD/BluRay disk duplicating system ("Duplicator").  The Gallery seeks a proposed solution to their need for duplicating disc-based media in a wide range of formats, and containing content of internal, outside, and international origin.  The Gallery, being a repository of archival media as is the case with many museums, is often called upon to provide access to archived content for public support, educational programming, and scholarly research.  Therefore, there is frequent need for disc duplication in CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray formats, and to accurately reproduce audio, video, imaging, and data file content.

The minimum technical requirements for the Duplicator are:
 Five (5) target burner;
 Minimum 500GB hard drive with computer-grade power supply;
 Free firmware updates available by email, throughout the life of the product;
 Duplication of at least the following standards/zones: CDR, DC-RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD D/L, BRD, BRD D-L, BRD-RW, BRD+RW;
 Toll-free tech support and component warranties for at least six (6) months; and
 One (1) Printer and at least two (2) cartridges for printing labels (printer shall print directly onto the disk - not on independent adhesive labels).
By submitting a quote, vendor certifies that the Duplicator quoted satisfies the above minimum requirements.

Optional features and additional information required to be provided in Vendor's quote:
 Vendor must provide a statement demonstrating responsiveness to firmware updates and quick relay of them to the NGA (I.e. How frequently/quickly will vendor provide updates to the NGA?);
 Provide a list of any additional standards/zones of media that are duplicable, in addition to the minimum types identified above;
 Provide information on any extended warranty/support available for the Duplicator in addition to the minimum six (6) months required;
 Provide a statement describing the speed and efficiency of the duplication process with the build that is quoted, as well as any available options for speed-increasing capabilities; and
 Identify any additional features provided with the quoted Duplicator. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and an additional written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31.

The solicitation documentation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31. FAR provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. FAR 52.212, Evaluation-Commercial Items, is applicable to this acquisition. In addition to Price, the following Technical Factors will be used in evaluating quotes, listed in increasing order of importance: (1) Vendor's Prior Experience and (2) Ability to Provide Maximum Features.  Technical factors will be weighted slightly heavier than price. The vendor submitting (hereinafter the "Vendor) a quote is responsible for providing information in its quote sufficient to allow the Gallery to evaluate the quote using these evaluation factors. Vendors must submit a Firm-Fixed Price, including a breakdown of pricing that, at a minimum, delineates the price for the duplicator with all minimum requirements, with options priced separately.  Vendor shall provide technical documentation for all major components included in the quoted Duplicator.  Furthermore, Vendor shall provide an explanation of why the proposed combination of components would benefit the NGA and provide the NGA with the best value over a different combination of components.  The NGA may use this information in its technical evaluation of proposals.  Vendor shall also provide at least three examples of prior experience building similar custom systems for other clients.  The NGA will give preference to experience building similar systems for gallerys, museums, cultural institutions, or government agencies.  Pricing information shall be submitted separate from the technical information requested above.

The NGA intends to award a contract to the Vendor whose quote, in its entirety, demonstrates that the Vendor will provide the best value to the NGA.  An award may be made to a Vendor whose quote does not represent the lowest price or the highest technical score. The National Gallery of Art seeks proposed solutions to their need for duplicating disc-based media in a wide range of formats, and containing content of internal, outside, and international origin.  Vendors are also advised that a contract award may be made without discussion or negotiation, so vendors are encouraged to submit their best value quote. 

FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition, which incorporates by reference, the following FAR clauses: 52.203-6 Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government (Alt 1, OCT 1995); 52.219-8. By submitting a quote in response to this RFQ, the vendor warrants that any goods or services provided to the Gallery in satisfaction of this requirement are fit for the ordinary purposes for which they were designed, as well as the particular purpose(s) specified in the this solicitation, and any additional purposes as represented by the vendor. 

This procurement is a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  The Small Business Administration (SBA) Business Size Standards for the NAICS code indicated in this synopsis applies.  However, all responsible large businesses able to sell all components on an eligible GWAC schedule may submit a quote by email, fax, mail, or courier service, which shall be considered by the Gallery.  No open-market quotes from large businesses will be accepted.  All quotes must be delivered to: David Reindl, Office of Procurement and Contracts (APC), 2000B South Club Drive, Landover, MD 20785; F: (202) 312-2792; P: (202)842-6515; d-reindl@nga.gov on or before the Response Date specified in this synopsis.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The regulatory authority is 41 USC 253(c)(2), FAR 6.302-, Unusual and compelling urgency.  The Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis.  GFSC currently uses the IT Change Control Broad (ITCCB) BAseline approval list for server specifications.  http://enm.irm.state.gov/IT_CCB/Baselines/Hardware/hwbaseline_servers.html  We currently have a server farm with all Hewlett Packard (HP) servers similar to the server erquested above and they all fit into our current rack space/configuration.  Substitutions may cause problems with space and compatibility. It would be safer to stay in the Hewlett Packard family of servers from a prior generation than to go with a brand/server that has never been on the approved list. Since GFSC already has a farm of HP servers, when we order new servers, we also order parts/drives that are interchangeable, allowing for greater redundancy and potential uptime. This allows for a single set of spare parts for maintenance which helps control costs and a single vendor point of contact for onsite maintenance thereby reducing administrative and operational overhead when maintenance is required. . . .<BR><BR>

<DESC>Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies Inc (LMCT) proposes new technology that will address the critical area of standoff biological aerosol detection. The proposed approach will further evaluate a new lidar technique, the Wavelength Normalized Depolarization Ratio (WANDER) technique which is suitable for day or night operations and the potential standoff range is limited primarily by visibility.  The results will demonstrate the ability to discriminate biological stimulants from various inorganic and organic dusts, diesel smoke and other target species.

<DESC><BR>In accordance with Section 844 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 Public Disclosure of Justification and Approval (J&As) Documents for Noncompetitive Contracts, the following Justification and Approval for other than Full and Open Competition is hereby posted:  <BR>1. Contracting Agency:  The responsible contracting agency is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), National Contracting Organization, Louisville District Contracting Office.<BR><BR>2. Description of Action:  Supplemental agreement/Contract Modification P0004 to existing Louisville District Contract No.W912QR-08-C-0007 with River City Construction, L.L.C.  The original award action was a firm fixed price contract in the amount of $74,210,000 for construction of the ADAL USTRANSCOM Consolidation project at Scott Air Force Base, IL using FY07 BRAC MILCON funds.  There is an FY09 option on this contract in the amount of $11,900,000 for the construction of the Joint Intelligence Operations Center (JIOC) project, which will be funded using FY09 DoD MILCON funds.  This proposed sole source out-of-scope bilateral modification would also be a firm fixed price negotiated action, using FY07 BRAC MILCON funds, FY09 DoD MILCON funds and DoD procurement funds for the construction services.  The project description for the new negotiated action is to provide an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for entry and exit control, and for intrusion detection throughout the secure portions of both the ADAL USTRANSCOM Consolidation and JIOC projects. DoD procurement funds will be used to fund the equipment portions of the IDS system in both the projects.  BRAC MILCON will be used to fund the IDS components that are an integral part of the facility in the ADAL USTRANSCOM Consolidation project.  DoD MILCON will be used to fund the IDS components that are an integral part of the facility in the JIOC project.   MILCON and procurement funding will be used to procure the IDS in accordance with Engineering Technical Letter 02-12:  Communications and Information System Criteria for Air Force Facilities.  This Engineering Technical Letter provides the guidance on what fund source to use for different components of the IDS. <BR><BR>3. Description of the Supplies/Service:  The contract modification will add an IDS system to building 1920 which is currently under construction, and to building 1900.  Both the ADAL TRANSCOM Consolidation and JIOC projects together comprise building 1920.  The building 1900 renovation is currently included in the construction contract, and is part of the overall scope of the ADAL TRANSCOM Consolidation project. The building 1920 IDS system is integral with and will tie into the building 1900 IDS system in order to provide connectivity back to the Security Forces Squadron.   The approximate estimated value of the construction contract modifications for the IDS infrastructure and the IDS equipment is $1,500,000 and $200,000 respectively.  Approximately 95 percent of the estimated cost is for building 1920, and 5 percent of the cost is for building 1900.   The IDS infrastructure including cabling, and the equipment will be installed during the same timeframe that the rest of the construction is taking place.  The contractor will not be given any additional time to incorporate the IDS installation into the overall construction activities and contract schedule.  <BR><BR>4. Authority Cited:  The statutory authority permitting acquisition of the requirement by Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>5. Reason for Authority Cited:  <BR><BR>(a)  Background:    The contract for the ADAL USTRANSCOM Consolidation project was awarded 15 February 2008 and notice to proceed was issued 12 March 2008.  The new construction of building 1920 and the renovation of building 1900 were included in the original award.  A connector between building 1920 and building 1900 is part of the contract, resulting in building 1920 becoming an addition to building 1900.  An IDS system for building 1920 and building 1900 were included in the contract solicitation as options, and the original plan was for the ADAL USTRANSCOM Consolidation construction contractor to procure and install the IDS components.   During the source selection evaluation period, the Contracting Officer was not able to determine what a fair and reasonable price was for the IDS contract options. It was suspected that the IDS portion of the Independent Government Estimate (IGE) may not have accurately accounted for the entire IDS scope, and an extensive analysis would be needed to verify its accuracy.  The Government was on a very tight schedule to award the construction project, and could not afford the time required for recreating the IGE for the IDS system.  Subsequently, the IDS options were not included in the awarded contract.   A new cost estimate is currently in process of being created for the IDS, and the cost will be negotiated with the construction contractor before the IDS contract modifications are awarded. The IDS is an integral part of the final completed facility, and the occupants will not be able to carry out their mission without this building system. Therefore it is necessary to proceed with installing this building system along with the rest of the facility components.  <BR><BR> (b)  Justification:  If the IDS is installed by second contractor, it would either need to be installed while the building construction is on going, or after the building construction is complete.  The current contract completion and the required project beneficial occupancy date is 12 March 2010 for the new construction.  The end user requires the IDS to be installed by 12 March 2010 as well, since the IDS is required for the facility to be complete and usable. If a second contractor is used to install the IDS, the requirement for achieving a beneficial occupancy date of 12 March 2010 will be in jeopardy.  The scenario of having a second contractor install the IDS while the building construction is on going is potentially very risky, considering that the building construction contractor has control and the responsibility for maintaining quality and safety until the construction is complete and turned over to the Government.   The building construction contractor would not have any control over a separate IDS contractor, thus creating the potential for an unsafe work environment, disputes on which contractor is at fault when quality issues arise, and logistical conflicts in regards to scheduling and coordination of work.   These conflicts create risk to the Government in the form of schedule delays, requests for equitable adjustment from the contractors, and potential quality issues that are difficult to resolve if more than one contractor was involved in the faulty work.  Any schedule delays will result in the project not meeting the required beneficial occupancy date. Alternatively, having a separate contractor install the IDS infrastructure, cabling and equipment after the building construction is complete may present less risk to the quality and safety of the project. Two months is estimated for a separate contractor to install the IDS after the building construction is complete, and the IDS would have an estimated completion time of 12 May 2010, which does not meet the required completion date of 12 March 2010.  In addition, tear out and redo of some finished construction work may be required in order to properly install the IDS.  Such tear out and redo of work would significantly add to the cost of the IDS installation, and ultimately further delay the beneficial occupancy date of the new facility.  Having the building construction contractor install the IDS will eliminate the risk to the Government for all of these problems, and is the only solution that will ensure the project is completed on time.<BR><BR>In addition, soliciting and awarding a competitive contract for IDS will duplicate cost and effort already incurred with award of the construction contract.  The estimated cost to prepare the solicitation, advertise, conduct a source selection board, and award the project is $80,000.  This duplication of cost can be avoided by sole sourcing the IDS to River City Construction and awarding the IDS as a construction modification on the current contract. <BR><BR>(c)  Impact:  Given the reasons stated above, if the J&A is not approved, the Government most likely would have the second contractor start work after the building construction was completed.   Having a separate contractor install the IDS infrastructure, cabling and equipment after the building construction is complete may require tear out and redo of finished construction work.  The end result of such tear out and redo of work would significantly add to the cost of the IDS installation, and delay the beneficial occupancy date of the new facility.         <BR><BR>(d)  Alternatives:  The Product Delivery Team discussed the following two alternatives:  issue modification to River City Construction, L.L.C. or competitively procure a second contract.    A second contractor may adversely impact the overall the project for the reasons discussed above.<BR>   <BR>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition:  <BR><BR>(a)  There was only one responding proposal submitted and evaluated for solicitation W912QR-07-R-0079 for the ADAL USTRANSCOM Consolidation project.  River City Construction, L.L.C was determined by the Contracting Officer as offering acceptable overall value in satisfying the Governments needs.  This firms price for the base bid and the options included in the contract were considered fair and reasonable.   <BR><BR>Further competition to solicit sources for the IDS requirements is considered to be unreasonable and not in the best interest of the Government given the reasons stated above.<BR><BR>(b)  This proposed modification action has been synopsized as required by FAR 5.201 (b) (1) (ii) and FAR 6.302-1(c) (2). The synopsis was published in the FedBizOpps on October 6, 2008 with a required response date for interested contractors to be submitted by October 21, 2008. There were no contractor responses received.    <BR><BR>7. Actions to Increase Competition:  Competition was considered; however, this action is a modification to an existing contract that was competed in full accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA).  Future requirements of this nature will be synopsized consistent with pertinent regulatory guidance.<BR><BR>8. Market Research:  Market research was not conducted because, as discussed in paragraph 5 above, only River City Construction, L.L.C., can complete the construction without incurring schedule and cost impacts due to tear out and redo of work. A FedBizOpps synopsis for the addition will not be published, however, as mentioned above a notice of sole source intent has been synopsized as required by FAR 6.302-1(c) (2).  <BR><BR>9. Interested Sources: None  <BR><BR>10. Other Facts:    <BR><BR>It is in the best interest of the Government to have one contractor perform this additional yet interrelated new work, and also have one contract with one set of warranties for this project, when the final product is delivered. <BR><BR>This supplement agreement/contract modification to the River City Construction, L.L.C., will be negotiated by the Contracting Officer to obtain a fair and reasonable cost for the construction services based on the Independent Government Cost Estimate which will be prepared.  Estimated takeoff and quantities will be obtained from the 100 percent design of the current project plans and specifications.<BR><BR>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
 

1. Requiring Activity: Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD)
Contracting Activity: Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC)
 
2. Description of the Action Being Approved. 

The purpose of this contract is to provide accurate, timely neurological laboratory testing services (attachment #1) for Naval Medical Center San Diego. Eighty percent of the tests required confirm if a patient has a genetic disease.  The remaining twenty percent of tests are diagnosis for DNA markers that are needed to determine if a patient is prone to a disease.  Services will include all necessary qualified personnel, transportation, materials, equipment, and supplies to perform and report accurate and timely laboratory testing.  The following is required:

a.	NMCSD will ship samples to vendor using a rapid delivery service. 
b.	Shipping kits will be provided by vendor.
c.	All reports must conform to College of American Pathologists (CAP) standards (e.g. a report must contain the patients full name, patient number, requesting physician, data and time of collection, date and time of receipt by requesting lab, date and time reported, test results with appropriate test range, initials or number of laboratory technician performing the test and the name of the laboratory performing the test).
d.	All laboratory test results will either be mailed, faxed or delivered to Naval Medical Center San Diego when results are completed 

A firm, fixed-price,  Indefinite delivery - Indefinite quantity contract is anticipated.

 3. Description of Supplies/Services. 

Laboratory specimens from patients at NMCSD are to be sent to Athena for testing and processing.  Athena is a laboratory dedicated to the development and commercialization of diagnostic testing for neurological disorders.   The dates of service will run from 01 January 2009 until 30 December 201.  The testing will cost an estimated $120,000 in FY 09 and increase each year an estimated $20,000, for a total of approximately $800,000.00

The contractors laboratory will meet the following requirements:

a.	Supplier to provide a copy of their College of American Pathologists Certification as required by CAP Accreditation and their Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) accreditation.
b.	Reference lab must act in accordance with commercial practices.
c.	All subcontracted referral facilities used by the contractor shall also meet the above requirements.

Estimated Dollar Value 
	FY 09 	FY 10	FY 11 	FY 12 	FY 13 	Total 
Total 	 $120,000	$140,000 	$160,000	$180,000	$200,000	$800,000

This requirement will be funded using Defense Health Program funding.

4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source as implemented by paragraph 6.302-1( c) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

5.  Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority. 

Athena Diagnostics provides extensive and comprehensive diagnostic testing for neurological, endocrine, and nephrology disorders.  Ninety-eight percent of all tests performed by Athena are patented and therefore will not be available from any other reference laboratory (Attachement #1).  This is listed on the company website at  www.athenadiagnostics.com webpage, which lists every test that Athena offers.  This has also been confirmed by contacting the company directly.  In addition, Athena is the only lab that offers all of the required tests at one facility using the same methodology.  It is critical for evaluation of results that the same methodology is used to test the specimens. According to the medical experts at NMCSD, accurate interpretation of the complete panel set of diagnostic test results on a patient can be achieved only if all tests have been performed by the same laboratory using the same method.
NMCSD conducted extensive research.  The research identified that no other labs perform all of the test indicated above. It is critical that the vendor is able to provide all of the tests as a complete and accurate diagnosis cannot be made without all of the critical elements.

6.  Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable. 

NMCSD has performed market research by contacting other large labs and is currently working with Quest Diagnostic laboratories to evaluate test menu availability and methodology sensitivity and specificity.   This evaluation project will require some time and effort to complete but will be conducted as a work-in-progress task.  Quest does not offer all of the required test at the current time.  

In addition, a notice will be posted to www.fbo.gov .  Proposals from all interested vendors will be reviewed.

7.Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.   

The contracting officer has determined the anticipated cost to the Government of the supplies/services covered by this J&A will be fair and reasonable. 

8.Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition. 
Future actions will be procured in accordance with FAR regulations.
