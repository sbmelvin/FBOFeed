<DESC>National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory intend to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Arizona to develop and validate appropriate, laboratory test methods for evaluating the performance Air Purifying Respirator (APR) cartridges for firefighting operations.  Dr. Burgess and the Environmental and Community Health division of the University of Arizona are unique in terms of their history of research with fire departments, and in particular the Phoenix Fire Department, involving occupational exposure to smoke in firefighters, respiratory protection and lung injury.  Dr. Burgess completed ground breaking and unique research on the lack of protection provided by standard air purifying respirators against combustion products during the overhaul process of firefighting.

Background and Need: 

The NPPTL provides world, national and Institute leadership for prevention and reduction of occupational disease, injury and death for workers who rely on personal protective technologies (PPT) through partnership, research, service, and communication. The NPPTL mission includes the development of performance criteria, certification standards and guidelines relating to the emergency responder protective 
ensembles. 

Representatives from the University of Arizona, 3M, Phoenix Fire Department, NPPTL and MSHA have been involved in discussions regarding use of the Air Purifying Respirators (APR) for use in fire operations.  APRs would provide an additional respiratory protection option for structural firefighters involved in overhaul operations, as well as wildland firefighters.  Overhaul (non-human) testing could take place in a firefighting training facility, and the Phoenix Fire Department is willing to make their training facility available.

Scope of Work:

No performance criteria or standards currently exist for evaluating APRs for use in fire operations. The proposed effort will develop and validate appropriate test methods to evaluate so-called “smoke cartridges” that could provide protection against low to moderate concentrations of products of combustion. APR cartridge performance for two kinds of firefighting operations will be investigated: overhaul operations dealing with the aftermath of structural firefighting, and wildlands firefighting. 

Detailed technical requirements:

For benchmarking purposes, the initial cartridges tested will include one CBRN cartridge (3M) and two multigas cartridges (Scott and 3M).  The rationale for the selection of cartridges is that 3M is willing to assist in the testing and that the Scott multigas cartridge was used previously for overhaul in the Phoenix Fire Department.  These cartridges will be tested against combustion of combined organic (wood and paper) and synthetic (foam, plastic) materials, prototypical of overhaul operations.

Benchmark testing will also be done for the wildland setting, including an N95 respirator (3M) and a carbon loaded N95 respirator (3M).  The rationale for selection of these cartridges is that a major concern in this setting is particulate exposure, with a more limited set of vapor phase exposures.  These cartridges will be tested against combustion of organic (wood, leaves and grasses) materials

Laboratory scale testing will be used to select sampling media and identify analytic techniques to be use  in subsequent workplace testing.  The laboratory tests will use simple combustion chambers or equivalent technology and materials as described above.  Sampling media will include chemical specific media, such as charcoal and silica sorbent tubes.  The analytic technique considered most appropriate to identify unknown is gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer.  Analytes of special interest include ultrafine particlulates, methyl isothiocyanate, and oxygen-based free radicals.

Upon completion of the laboratory scale tests, validation trails will be conducted at the Phoenix Fire Department Training Center, using structural materials and organic matter prototypical of wildlands firefighting.

<DESC>COMBINED MARKET SURVEY/PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF SINGLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT As part of a Department of Transportation Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of Defense to modernize the Global Positioning System (GPS), the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center has been tasked with procuring the requisite testing equipment.  A GPS Constellation simulator that can generate signals used in GPS receiver and operational testing is required.  This simulator will be used to conduct backward compatibility testing, receiver interference testing, requirements validation, receiver characterization of new L2C and L5 receivers, development test and operational test procedures validation.  GPS Modernization will provide new civil signals on the L2 and L5 frequencies.  The simulated signals must be a faithful reproduction of the actual signals in terms of signal quality, content, and message contents.  There must also be a capability to change parameters during simulation in order to produce the effects of vehicle motion, changing conditions along the simulated radio frequency (RF) path, and to simulate failures.  The introduction of the L5 signal will also require more simulation and analysis in support of reference station development, monitoring, receiver characterization, and system modeling.  The addition of this simulation capability will permit FAA to examine expected performance and impact on existing GPS and Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) receivers.  Spirent Federal Systems, Inc, 22345 La Palma, Suite 105, Yorba Linda, CA, appears to be the only known responsible source for a GPS constellation simulator that has the proprietary equipment and software capable of meeting the following FAA' requirements:   a.	Replication of all civil and military signals on the existing L1 and L2 frequencies for 16 satellites; b.	Ability to generate the new L2C signal in all variations being designed into the satellites; c.	Ability to generate the new L5 frequency and signal structure; d.	Generation of a realistic M-Code spectrum, including the M-Code message structure and the public encryption technique commonly called pseudo-M Code; e.    Ability to generate WAAS messages and incorporate them into the composite signal; f.    Simulation of realistic vehicle motion for aircraft, ground and water vehicles; g.   Generation of realistic signals based on real-time control inputs of vehicle motion; h.   Capability to mix externally generated noise sources with the signal; and i.    Production of identical results to those of existing laboratories at the U.S. Air Force 746th Test Squadron, Holloman AFB, NM. In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to simultaneously conduct market research and, in the event that no offerors respond with the requisite capability, to inform the industry of the FAA's decision to contract with Spirent Federal Systems to obtain this simulator. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's ability to provide a GPS constellation simulator that meets all the requirements listed above.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Phyliss Schlegel no later than noon, local time, June 10, 2005.  The mailing address is FAA, William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey 08405 (Attn: P. Schlegel, ACT-51).

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.
A critical area of focus for DHS is the protection of the homeland from the release of a biological agent, as demonstrated by the currently deployed BioWatch surveillance system.  In FY04, HSARPA initiated two critical bio-sensor development initiatives under the Detection Systems for Biological and Chemical Countermeasures (DSBCC) Program, RA03-01. These systems, the Bioagent Autonomous Networked Detectors (BAND) and the Rapid Automated Biological Identification System (RABIS), will provide a cost effective, robust capability for continuous monitoring for a broad range of potential bio-aerosol threats with very high sensitivity and specificity.  As a complement to the technology programs initiated under RA03-01, HSARPA also initiated the BAA04-18 Instantaneous Bio-Aerosol Detector Systems (IBADS) program to develop, test and transition the next generation of rapid bio-aerosol sensors for use in Detect-to-Protect system architectures. 

As a compliment to the above programs, HSARPA is initiating the Low-cost Bio-Aerosol Detector Systems (LBADS) program. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) intends to address the need for very low-cost bio-aerosol sensors (<$1,000 each for high quantity production runs) to further enhance the Detect-to-Protect technologies developed under the IBADS program.  The LBADS program will develop optimized sensor systems characterized by the following performance metrics (see Appendix G for definitions):

+ Improved Sensitivity (Level of Detection)
+ Low Probability of False Positive (Pfp)
+ High Probability of Detection (Pd)
+ Rapid Response Time
+ Very Low Cost of Ownership

The LBADS program will support research to determine trade-offs between the above metrics for selected sensor concepts, with a particular emphasis on the development of very low cost (<$1,000) biological sensors.  DHS intends to collaborate with the Department of Defense (DoD) to complete this effort and will place a high priority on transferring technology developed under DARPA’s SUVOS Program. 

Attached to this synopsis is the Broad Agency Announcement for the LBADS effort. This document and additional information is available at http://www.hsarpabaa.com.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (N3CA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the procurement of a Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) radio network in support of Stages 1 and 2 of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Expansion.

The estimated value of this procurement is not available at this time.

NC3A was nominated as Host Nation for this project, which was fully authorized by the Infrastructure Committee. The Committee noted that the project will be handled under the Two-Stage Authorization Procedure. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) to be issued is IFB-CO-11560-OPL and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFIB/IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

NATO has envisioned the need to establish an ISAF FM-radio network in Afghanistan to transmit over-the-air broadcasts to the ISAF target audience, the citizens of Afghanistan. (The radio broadcast studio and satellite transmission/reception terminals are established and are not part of this project.) This project main objective is to acquire the equipment and services necessary to allow for the rebroadcast of the original ISAF-generated audio within nine Provisional Reconstruction Team (PRT) areas, including possibly 20 remote areas surrounding their local periphery. To meet this objective, the contractor must perform radio coverage analysis for the broadcast areas, procure equipment (including power systems, housing for the equipment and operating personnel), and provide installation, maintenance activities and associated training to operate designated nodes of the radio network.  

At each of the nine PRT sites, the delivered equipment will accept an in-place digital audio signal and broadcast that signal over-the-air in a commercial FM band to a local Afghan radio audience. It is anticipated that some of those PRT sites will have the physical space and geographical characteristics to allow the contractor to connect radio transmission equipment directly to the satellite terminal receiving the digital audio signal. Other sites will require the contractor to provide additional equipment to retransmit the digital audio signal from the PRT satellite terminal to the remote radio transmission equipment. Contractor-hired personnel are to be responsible for the operation and physical security of the project equipment.

Additionally, it is anticipated that up to 20 remote areas will require coverage for which the PRT transmission sites are unable to effectively reach. In such circumstances, the contractor will propose locations within the main transmitter footprint to install additional equipment that can re-broadcast the PRT-FM transmission in order to extend the coverage to more remote areas. Contractor-hired personnel are to be responsible for the operation and physical security of the equipment. At the radio broadcast studio site, some miscellaneous communication equipment will be required to interface the digital audio signal from the radio broadcast studio (through in-place bandwidth managers) to the VSAT terminal multicasting the audio stream.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

Radio coverage analysis of broadcast areas;

FM over-the air re-broadcast;

Retransmission of FM radio signal between PRT satellite terminal and FM transmission equipment (when equipment not physically co-located together);

Complete power generation for project equipment:
24-7 requirement for the nine PRT sites,
Backup power generation for remote locations;

Environmentally controlled sheltering for project equipment (at PRT site locations),
Sheltering for project equipment (at remote locations);

Interfacing the audio signal from the broadcasting studio into the NATO Bandwidth Management Equipment (BME); extracting the audio signal from the BME; interface the audio signal into the VSAT up-link;

Civil works associated with the contractor provided equipment;

Operations and periodic/emergency maintenance of equipment to be performed by the contractor;

Equipment must operate under the rigors of harsh climatic conditions;

All equipment acquired is to be transportable by military means, including air (C130/C160);

General training of ISAF personnel regarding operations of equipment at PRTs

INSTALLATION SCENARIOS:

Civil works preparation of the PRT site areas will be done by the contractor with regard to the project equipment requirements. The sequence and timing of the installations will be given according to the operational requirements of ISAF. All project equipment installation activities are to be done by the contractor.

Three different equipment installation scenarios are envisioned for the contract to perform:

Scenario 1: FM broadcast system located directly on a PRT compound;
Scenario 2: FM broadcast system located nearby a PRT compound;
Scenario 3: Radio repeater system located at a remote village site

IMPLEMENTATION:

This procurement generally consists of the same sets of equipment being installed and operated from different locations. Site equipment for each PRT will be independent from all other PRT sites with respect to operations. Implementation will be done in a sequence consistent with the operational requirements of ISAF.

LOGISTICS SUPPORT:

The contractor will be asked to provide a comprehensive Integrated Logistic Support package. This would include, but may not be limited to, providing: spare parts, warranty, periodic and emergency maintenance, technical documentation, as well as initial and follow-on training.

DELIVERY SPECIFICATIONS

All of the bids submitted in response to this IFIB/IFB shall show the minimum validity of 12 months from the bid closing date.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999).  The following Factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  (1) OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS, (2) PAST PERFORMANCE, and (3) PRICE.  PRICE will be evaluated as an element of the overall offer.  Offerors may propose stepladder quantity pricing (i.e., 1-10, $xx; 11-20 $xx).  However, the price will be evaluated on the combination of a quantity of 57 units for the Base and 50 units for the Option.

Under Operational Effectiveness, the offerors should discuss their products’ compliance with the requirements.  The Offeror shall include Past Performance references on contracts of similar nature including Name of contracting activity, contract number, contract type, total contract value, and Points of Contact (name, phone and Fax numbers).

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions; however, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions if necessary. FAR Clauses:  52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicit! ation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help y! ou gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-1 Buy American Act-Supplies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.o.B.

<DESC>.  THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A  PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate and award  a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Dr. Robert M. Chasson, 9608 Hawick  Lane, Kensington, Maryland 20895, to provide professional and scientific support services for the NHLBI grant review function. Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, and materials needed to perform the statement of work.   The  Contractor shall provide support services to the designated Federal Official (DFO)/Scientific Review Administrator (SRA), by conducting a careful administrative review of grant applications checking the format and content of applications, reviewing  personnel and consultant lists and letters of collaboration to determine areas of  potential conflicts of interest.  The Contractor will assist in searches for potential reviewers with specific expertise to assist in developing rosters.  The Contractor will provide assistance in preparing and updating information pertaining to grant applications, by means of automated databases, such as IMPAC II, in accordance with established policies and procedures.  The Contractor will attend the Scientific Review Group meetings and provide administrative assistance as required, including drafting notes on administrative issues such as human subjects, animal assurances and budget.  The Contractor will ensure timely preparation and release of high-quality, summary statements by preparing drafts of the written summary statements and editing as necessary, for review, revision, and approval by  the DFO/SRA.   The Contractor will ensure adherence to the Privacy Act by  not disclosing any information contained in the grant applications or reviews to anyone not directly connected with the grant review process and must protect the contents of the applications.  Satisfactory performance of the contact shall be deemed to occur upon delivery and acceptance by the Contracting Officer, or the duly authorized representative, of the review meeting?s meeting plans, minutes, summary statements, and progress reports as requested by the Project.  The Contractor?s project manager shall meet with the NHLBI Project Officer and Review Branch Staff to report on progress on a periodic and / or  monthly basis.  The designated Federal Official (DFO)/Scientific Review Administrator (SRA),  Project Officer is Valerie Prenger, Ph.D. Chief, Review Branch Division of Extramural Affairs,  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 6701 Rockledge Drive  Room 7214 Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7924.  The Project Officer is responsible  for (1) monitoring the Contractor?s technical progress, including the surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending to the Contracting Officer changes in requirements; (2) interpreting the Statement of Work and any other technical performance requirements; (3) performing technical evaluation as required; (4) performing technical inspections and acceptances required by this contract; and (5) assisting in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance.  The Contracting Officer is the only person with authority to act as agent of the Government under this contract. Only the Contracting Officer has authority to: (1) direct or negotiate any changes in the Statement of Work; (2) modify or extend the period of performance; (3) change the delivery schedule; (4) authorize reimbursement to the Contractor any costs incurred during the performance of this contract; or (5) otherwise change any terms and conditions of this contract.  The Government may unilaterally change its Project Officer designation.   The DFO/SRA will conduct the review meetings and prepare the final summary statements, and compile sets of raw critiques and  copy any handwritten notes from discussion of each application, and also review the drafts and finalize the summary statements after the contractor has completed the required task, and will conduct all functions that are inherently governmental functions.    Approximately 860 man hours, averaging 40 hours per week,  for a period of six (6) months is estimated for this effort.  An option to extend the period of performance for an additional six (6) months is intended for this effort.   The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills and expertise gained by Dr. Chasson during his employment with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

Dr. Chasson, is thoroughly familiar with the use of the specialized data bases required for the review for the review of NHLBI grant application NHLBI Consultant Reference System, CRISP, and IMPAC II.  An award to any other source would affect NHLBI?s anticipated outcome based upon Dr. Chasson?s experience, and would not provide cost savings to the Government.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. The acquisition is being conducted  under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement is not applicable to simplified acquisition.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Social Security Act requires the Commissioner to enter into contracts with the states to secure death certificate data.  Under these existing contracts, the States must submit this data to SSA within 90-120 days of the month of the person’s death.  This contract supports SSA’s requirement to receive death data more timely and accurately to administer its programs more effectively.  The contractor shall provide consulting services for the implementation of electronic death registration.  This EDR affects Title II and Title XVI beneficiaries and other Federal agencies’ beneficiaries.  EDR will enable SSA to realize significant administrative and program savings by terminating Social Security benefits more timely because of death.  Other federal benefit paying agencies will avoid incorrect payments by terminating their benefits more timely based on receipt of SSA’s death master file.  SSA anticipates a sole source award to the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS).  NAPHSIS is a national association of state vital records and public health statistics offices which is based in the Washington, D.C. area, and is a not for profit agency.  

This work is follow-on work which was provided under current contract (0600-03-60150).  The contractor shall: Submit a Project Management Plan to ensure sound performance and compliance with the contract requirements.  This plan must include the type of consulting services the Contractor will provide to the States; which conferences the Contractor will attend and the degree of participation; the content and distribution of the marketing materials; and the updates to the NAPHSIS website and the schedule for publication.  Additionally, the contractor shall attend the National Funeral Director’s Association conference and the National Association of Medical Examiners to exhibit the EDR booth, distribute EDR brochures and provide oral presentation on the benefits of EDR specific to each group.  The contractor shall continue consultation/technical support to States awarded SSA monies but have not yet implemented, as well as states awarded FY2005 monies.  This consultation will include providing technical assistance to the States to fully integrate the NAPHSIS Online Verification Software (OVS) with their EDR system and test the Fact of Death file.  The Contractor will also assist the States in modifications that may be necessary due to differences in system configuration and design and to ensure that the States have made modifications to incorporate SSA specifications in their EDR system; e.g., the 5 strike rule.  Consultation includes identifying and correcting any challenges or obstacles the States face that may impede successful implementation of EDR system.  The contractor shall also prepare and submit monthly status reports.

Vendors capable of meeting SSA’s requirements for consulting services for EDR must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by close of  business on June 05. The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender.  Instead, the knowledge obtained from information submitted will be used to determine whether there appears to be a competitive source in the marketplace.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate solely with Versa Management Systems, Inc., 110 North Kenilworth Avenue-7A, Oak Park, Illinois  60304 under the authority of 41 U.S.C (253)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 6.302-1 “ Only one responsible source and no other source will satisfy agency requirements” for continued development and implementation of the Electronic Folder (EF) generic interface and Document Management Architecture (DMA) interface for a disability system operating in a DDS using licensed proprietary software developed by Versa Management Systems, Inc (Versa) into 17 supported Versa DDSs.  

Over the last few years, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) have been engaged in major initiatives to improve the administration of the disability programs.  These initiatives included enhancements to the disability information systems used within SSA and the DDSs.  SSA has updated its strategy for automating enhancements to the Disability program. Versa developed and implemented the DDSs Case Processing System changes by utilizing COBOL, JAVA and XML languages on an AS/400 platform.  In addition Versa has worked with the current SSA infrastructure, which consists of IWS/LAN, WebSphere Messaging Queues, IBM Content Manager and interface with SSA mainframes.  Versa is the only known source that can provide the support required by each state. Versa has provided some form of DDS support for 18 years and has developed all the user interfaces and screen designs. Versa owns the source code and it is assumed that they have total familiarity with the code and data structures for all the DDSs they serve.

The Electronic Disability system (eDib) is a comprehensive project for all components in the disability processing enterprise.  One of the major objectives of eDib is to provide access to and sharing of disability information to all disability processing components through an Electronic Folder.   The Electronic Folder is pictured as a data store that contains information that is directly or indirectly important to processing disability cases.  

To support the next and any subsequent releases of eDib, modifications will be needed to the Versa EFI/DMA interface software and its supporting processes. The modifications will allow the DDS software systems to receive additional data elements from SSA’s Electronic Folder.  The new data from SSA will provide additional case processing and update capabilities required to process disability cases after initial establishment.  These modifications must be designed so that, in the future, the interface and its supporting processes can be implemented in additional Versa states.  The modifications must preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the specific user interfaces and user screen presentations which exist in the current DDS systems.  Any responding vendor must demonstrate success in writing COBOL and JAVA applications utilizing the AS400 platform,  process WebSphere Messaging Queues transactions, interface with IBM Content Manager and interface with SSA mainframes.

Vendors authorized and capable of continuing SSA’s EFI development and implementation must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by SSA’s close of business on June 06, 2005 and refer to Versa EFI/DMA-05.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender.  Instead, the knowledge obtained from information submitted will be used to determine whether there appears to be a competitive source in the marketplace.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland requires a Contractor to provide custom computer programming services for one of its legacy systems used by the NIST Measurement Assurance Program.

History of the activities surrounding this specific requirement:

The Engineering Metrology Group (EMG) in the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory of NIST is the primary calibration laboratory for the United States.  EMG has developed specialized software to implement its Measurement Assurance Program.  This software is an integrated set of programs that manages the complete calibration cycle, including customer information, data taking and analysis, report writing, statistical process control, and management of the master gauge system.  Currently there are versions for gauge blocks, thread wires, angle blocks and sphere diameter.  All of these will be merged into a single lab system.  There are also auxiliary programs to interface a number of instruments into this system as well as those of the M48 CMM and dilatometer.

Why the Government has a need for this requirement:

The current system being used by NIST was developed in Hewlett Packard BASIC, and has been used and occasionally modified for over the past twenty (20) years.  These changes need to be integrated into a single system, and to ensure future changes can be made and supported we have decided to have the system to be re-written such that such changes and support can be easily done.  Because of some limitations in our instrument interfaces, the software system LabView will need to be used for communicating to instruments.

High level overview of the deliverables or other project outputs (more details will be in RFP):

Base Period:  Validation of core GAGE program using data generated in the EMG Gage Block Laboratory.  Development of detailed descriptions of the angle block, wire, cylinder, and sphere diameter systems in parallel to the GAGE system for gage blocks.  Interface programs for auxiliary sensors into existing software systems will be documented and validated.

Option Period I:  Coding, documentation, and validation of software for angle, wire, cylinder, and ball calibrations.  

Procurement Method:

This will be an unrestricted, full and open competitive procurement to be conducted under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, procedures, since NIST has determined that a small business set-aside is not appropriate based on its market research and has received approval from the U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business (OSDBU) to conduct this procurement on an unrestricted, full and open competition basis based on NIST’s market research.

North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541511 will apply to the procurement, with a small business size standard of $21.0 million.

The Government contemplates award of a single Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) completion type contract consisting of a base period of one year and one one-year option period for services specified in the performance work statement that will be included in the RFP.

A Request for Proposals (RFP) is anticipated to be posted on www.fedbizopps.gov on or about June 13, 2005, with proposals due thirty (30) days after RFP release date.  The solicitation, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will only be made available via www.fedbizopps.gov.  Potential offerors are encouraged to monitor www.fedbizopps.gov periodically to determine when the RFP has been posted.

The incumbent Contractor for this acquisition is American University, Washington, D.C.

Interested parties must submit a proposal in response to Section L of the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.

No “bidders list” is being maintained for this procurement.

Instructions for how to submit questions relating to this acquisition will be included in Section L of the RFP when it is posted to www.fedbizopps.gov.  No telephone questions/inquiries will be entertained.

Proposals will be due no later than thirty (30) days after RFP release unless the RFP is amended to extend the due date for proposals.

All responsible sources may submit an offer in response to the RFP after it is posted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS ADVERTISEMENT REPLACES W912QR-05-R-0024 IN ITS ENTIRETY.  THE CHANGES IMPACT SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS FIRMS AND 8(A) FIRMS. 1. GENERAL CONTRACT INFORMATION: This announcement is restricted to HubZone Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses and 8A firms.  One contract is anticipated to be awarded to one firm in each of these categories.  However, if the re are not enough highly qualified Service Disabled Veteran-owned firms,  two contracts may be awarded to highly qualified HubZone Small Businesses.  The proposed services, which will be obtained by a negotiated Firm Fixed Price Contract, are for Architect /Engineer services for primarily military projects within the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division Mission Boundaries; however, some Civil works design may be required. Projects will be awarded by Individual Task Orders not to exceed $3,000,000 with the max imum contract value being $3,000,000 for each contract. The estimated construction cost per project is approximately between $100,000 and $20,000,000. The contract period is cumulative and ends three years from date of award. Significant emphasis will be p laced on the A/Es quality control procedures, as the District will perform the Quality Assurance role only. Estimated start date is July 2005. To be eligible for award, a firm must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, vi a the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414. Register to provide representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov.  If three firms are selected; the top ranked fir m in each category will be awarded a contract. If there are no highly qualified submittals in one or more of the small business categories, a contract may be awarded to two or three highly qualified firms in the other small business categories.

Objective 1 – Provide IV&V services to support USAID IT-related Decision Making Processes. 

This objective requires a contractor that can provide objective assessments of facts relative to defined criteria to support good strategic, tactical and operational management decisions about USAID’s information technology projects and operations.

Objective 2 – Provide Software and System life-cycle IV&V. 

This objective requires a contractor that can conduct IV&V using selected standards to ensure that planning, development, management and support processes are in place and working properly.

Objective 3 – Provide Project Management IV&V services. 

This objective requires a contractor that can provide support to ensure that project management disciplines are incorporated into USAID’s key IT-related projects throughout the project lifecycle.

The ADS-548 can be accessed on the following site: http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/500/548.pdf

It is the intent of the USAID to compete an IV&V blanket purchase agreement under the General Services Administration IT 70 Schedule Contract or the General Services Administration Professional Engineering Services (Schedule 871)using a pre-qualified supplier list.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. Prequalification does not constitute a contract award. It is a business decision of the Contracting Team to pre-qualify. The USAID reserves the right to terminate this process if the needs of the USAID change. Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USAID activities. USAID is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.

PRE-QUALIFICATION PROCESS

In order to be considered for the pre-qualification process, all interested parties must submit information that addresses the items listed in the Request for Information section of this document.

BACKGROUND

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was created by executive order in 1961, when President John F. Kennedy signed the Foreign Assistance Act into law.  USAID has been the principal U.S. Agency to extend assistance to countries recovering from disaster, trying to escape poverty, and engaging in democratic reforms.

The mission of USAID is to administer economic assistance programs that assist developing countries to realize their full potential through the development of citizen and democratic societies and the dynamism of free markets and individual initiative.  USAID administers economic assistance by pursuing a strategy of sustainable development.  The strategy is based on aiding the environment; addressing population and health; fostering democracy; and encouraging economic growth.

Information systems play an important role in monitoring and measuring USAID’s progress in implementing its mission.  To this end, USAID leverages information technology resources to support long-term and equitable economic growth and advance U.S. foreign policy objectives by supporting economic growth, agricultural and trade, global health and democracy, conflict and humanitarian assistance.  USAID provides assistance in four regions of the world:  Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Near East, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe and Eurasia.  With its headquarters in Washington, D.C. USAID has over 80 field offices (Missions) around the world.

USAID’s Information Resources Management and PMO are responsible for the Agency’s information technology projects and programs.  USAID utilizes various contracting vehicles to deliver IT solutions and operating support.  In order to maintain integrity within the IT program, USAID seeks an unbiased and objective source to provide quality assurance through IV&V support services.

Selection Process

Request for Information

The USAID decision to pre-qualify suppliers is a business decision of the Purchase Team. Pre-qualification does not constitute an award. Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item that demonstrates a respondent’s capability to provide, implement, integrate, and manage an IV&V program at USAID.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for a heavy duty, CNC, 5-axis, bed-type milling machine.  This machine will be used in the fabrication and modification of vibration and acoustic test fixtures.  Any proposed machine shall be capable of both horizontal boring and vertical milling operations with minimal operator interaction.  Operator installation of a right-angle attachment is not acceptable.  The machine must be capable of switching configurations from vertical to horizontal at the command of the operator.  Any proposed machine must meet the following specifications as a minimum: 1.	The machine shall have an articulating head.  The head will allow for positioning in two planes.	One plane of adjustment will be perpendicular to the milling table top surface and parallel to the table's long axis (plane A) while the other plane is perpendicular to the milling table top surface and perpendicular to the long axis of the table (plane B); thus, allowing for adjustment of the head from vertical milling configuration to a horizontal boring position as well as being capable of left and right tilt.  The head position shall be controlled by the CNC controller and will have positive stops no more than 2.5 degrees apart in each direction.  The head shall have 360 degrees of rotation in plane A and at least 90 degrees of rotation in plane B.	The spindle shall accept V-flanged, CAT-50 taper tooling. 2.	The machine shall have travels of at least 72 inches in the longitudinal, 59 inches in the vertical, and 47 in the cross direction. All three axes shall have scaled feedback.  Cross travel shall be accomplished via a horizontally stroking ram or spindle. A moving column is not acceptable.  The majority of our machining requirements involve machining and drilling operations on flat plates; thus, the machine must allow for machining and drilling of a minimum 44" square plate mounted flat down (on standoffs) to the milling table.  It is also not acceptable to have a way or bed protruding from the front of the machine.  The operator must have unimpeded access to the work piece and head all along the front of the machine.   3.	Table shall be at least 72 inches long by 36 inches wide with 5 rows of ¾" T-slots.  The table shall support at least 15,000 pounds and function normally under load. 4.	Feed rate range shall be at least 0-150 inches per minute. 5.	Main spindle speed shall be continuously variable and range from 50 to 2500 RPM. 6.	Main spindle motor shall be a minimum 25 horsepower and operate on 480 VAC, 60 Hz, 3 phase power. 7.	The machine guarding shall be positioned in such a way as to protect an operator in front of the machine, but allow for long work pieces to be placed in the longitudinal axis of the table.  The machine guarding shall be easily manipulated by the operator to allow access to the work piece and head. 8.	A probe-type part centering and alignment system shall be included. 9.	Ways shall have a minimum hardness of 50 Rockwell C and all guides shall be Turcite coated. 10.	The machine shill utilize ball screws on the table, ram, and column. 11.	Automatic lubrication shall be included. 12.	A complete coolant system shall be included. 13.	The machine shall be CNC controlled, but shall also have hand-wheel controls for all three main axes.  The CNC controller shall feature an 11 inch color LCD screen and shall have conversational software.  No specialized programming language will be required to operate the machine.  The control unit shall have programs for drilling in line, circle, grid, and arc formations; boring, reaming, and rigid tapping.  It will compensate for tool radius and length.  The control unit shall have interpolation features for linear, circular, and operation on inclined planes.  The controller shall be mounted on a pendant and be easily accessible from the front of the machine. 14.	Total weight of the machine alone will not exceed 40,000 pounds. 15.	Positioning accuracy and repeatability shall both be less than 0.001 inch.  Resolution shall be less than 0.0001 inch. 16.	Machine shall be capable of operation in an environment of between 60 degrees and 95 degrees F. 17.	Terms shall be FOB destination. 18.	Delivery shall be 60-90 days ARO. 19.	Machine installation, start-up, and training shall be included in the offer and shall be a minimum of 5 days onsite at MSFC. 20.	Machine shall include a minimum 1 year parts and labor warranty. 21.	Machine shall be new.  Used equipment will not be accepted.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.

<DESC>CMS seeks information from all interested Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) and Quality Assurance (QA) vendors currently on GSA Schedule regarding their capabilities to provide support services to develop and maintain a structured IT environment by performing independent assessments of processes, products and progress (Projects are large and long-term, encompassing national information.). With the employment of IV&V from the initiation through the implementation of a project, problems will be identified earlier and, as a result, resolved with fewer resources expended. Team members shall ensure that CMS IT applications are developed, tested, and implemented in accordance with CMS policies and standards.  Signed “non-disclosure agreements” shall be in affect from each offeror for all tasking within this contract. Awardees will be restricted from bidding on any CMS IT development/operations projects. 
o	Sample IV&V / QA tasking would include, but is not limited to:
&#61607;	Review project artifacts for completeness, quality and accuracy
&#61607;	Assess third part process assessments
•	CM
•	Project Management
•	Software Development
•	Risk Management, etc.
&#61607;	Creation of Project Artifacts
•	Requirements Documentation
•	Test Plans, etc.
&#61607;	Creation of SDLC Policies, Procedures and Processes
•	CM policies
•	Risk Management, etc.
&#61607;	Serve as Independent Testers
•	Test Case and Protocol Development
•	Test Evaluations and Reports, etc.
&#61607;	Serve as Subject Mater Experts for all CMS IT Services
ORGANIZATION CONFLICT OF INTEREST

(The Organizational Conflict of Interest policy will flow down to all subcontractors unless an exemption is specifically approved by CMS)

Due to the overriding need for contractor independence to protect the integrity and usefulness of IV&V and to avoid significant potential organization conflicts of interest (as defined in FAR 9.501) and/or the appearance of impartiality and/or unfair competitive advantage:
•	Offeror(s) may be excluded from IV&V contract competition and/or precluded from an IV&V contract and
•	Awardee(s) and their subcontractor’s may be precluded from the future award of CMS software or hardware related contracts and/or subcontracting or consulting for a CMS supplier.
Since the IV&V contractor’s independence is vital to the usefulness and value of its services and the IV&V contractor’s findings may effect future CMS contracting, CMS foresees very few circumstances under which an IV&V contractor could perform other CMS contracts or subcontracts without presenting a potential organizational partiality and/or unfair competitive advantage.  In accordance with the FAR, the CMS contracting officer will make a case-by-case determination of the existence of organizational conflicts of interest.  If a potential organizational conflict of interest is identified, the contracting officer will determine if the conflict can be sufficiently mitigated.  Prior to proposal, offerors should examine relevant Federal laws and regulations on organizational conflict of interest, including but not limited to FAR 9.501 – 9.508.  If awarded an IV&V contract, the contractor must disclose its IV&V contract status in all future bids and/or proposals made to CMS for a period of one year after the conclusion of its IV&V contract.  The impact of the FAR 9501 – 9.508 and/or the terms of this clause are subject to negotiation.

The successful offeror must have complete independence in this IV&V effort (unless specifically exempted by CMS). Contractors desiring to provide IV&V services to CMS under this procurement will not be able to provide services other than IV&V services on any future procurements during the period of performance of this contract and up to one year thereafter.  CMS does not intend to suspend, terminate, or otherwise end current non-IV&V contract(s) with the successful offeror due to award of this IV&V contract.  However, proposals on this IV&V effort submitted by offeror(s) who currently have a contract with CMS which contains either option years, or the potential for additional period(s) of performance, will be reviewed to determine whether the offeror can be awarded the IV&V contract and maintain complete independence.  

Documentation should be sent to:  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Attention:  Barbara Brunstetter, C2-21-15, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland  21244.  All documents shall be received by 11:00 AM, June 14, 2005.  Questions may be referred to Barbara Brunstetter, 410-786-7577.This is not a request for proposal and is not to be contstrued as a commitment by the Government.

<SUBJECT>U--Sources Sought for US Army e-Learning Program

<RESPDATE>061505
<ARCHDATE>08142005
<CONTACT>Richard Sturgis, 703-325-6068
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.  The US Army Contracting Agency-ITEC4 is planning an acquisition for the requirements of the US Army e-Learning program.  The contract will be a follow-on to the current e-Learning contract with Skillsoft.  The  purpose of this synopsis is to identify qualified sources that can meet the Armys e-Learning requirements, and to solicit answers to questions and comments on the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and the acquisition strategy.    The e-Learning program is managed by the Program Manager, Distributed Learning System (PM DLS), Newport News, Virginia.  The Army e-Learning Program provides free training for every Active Army, National Guard, Reservist, ROTC Cadet and Department of the A rmy Civilian with access currently to over 1,500 web-based information technology, business, leadership, and personal development courses.  These courses are accessible by authorized users with an Internet connection.  Army e-Learning benefits under the cu rrent contract include opportunities for enlisted personnel promotion points; over 40+ certification programs, such as MCSE, A+, CISSP, Cisco, Oracle and more with personal mentoring; continuous learning points for civilian acquisition workforce; and some college course accreditation.  The program supports the total population of the Army of approximately 1.4 million people (Active Duty, Reserve, National Guard, and civilians).   The e-Learning contractor will be required to provide access to commercial, web-based courseware on general IT as well as vendor-specific IT subjects, such as information assurance, public key infrastructure, telecommunications, management, employee develo pment, and general education.  The courseware also will be ordered from time to time on CD/ROM/DVD for copying and distribution by the Government to soldiers who do not have Internet access.   In addition, the contractor will perform the full range of services required to manage the course-ware, including but not limited to providing courseware updates, managing student progress and course completion, maintaining a help desk, designing custom p ath curricula, and reporting performance measures and metrics.  Acquisition Strategy.  The Government is considering a 10-year, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract.  The contract will be performance-based.  Orders will be issued from time to time for the services provided by the contractor.   Pricing Strategy.  The Government plans to require offerors to provide a fixed monthly price for access to the offerors proposed courseware library and all associated services.  The scope of the offerors courseware proposal will be considered in the eval uation.  Range pricing may be offered based on the ranges of concurrent users, but may not be offered based on the number of courses offered.  Custom path development and administration will be acquired on a T&M basis (unless NSP from the monthly access ch arge).  Given current and future budget constraints on the Army, monthly pricing is necessary to allow the Government greater ordering flexibility than annual license payments and to simplify administration.  In addition, monthly pricing will allow the Gov ernment to utilize performance-based contracting techniques.     The contractor will be selected based on a best value evaluation in accordance with FAR Part 15.  A small business set-aside is not planned.  The applicable NAICS code is 511210.  The applicable FSC is U012.   The Government plans on requesting offerors to submit a Performance Work Statement (PWS) based on the Statement of Objectives (SOO) contained in the solicitation.  The PWS will incor-porate performance-based standards and incentives/disincentives.   IMPORTANT.  The draft SOO is attached to this synopsis.  Vendors are requested to submit comments on the SOO.  (Comments on the SOO not to exceed 5 pages.)     The Government plans on releasing the e-Learning Solicitation in June 2005 an d awarding the contract in September 2005.  At the appropriate time an additional solicitation synopsis will be issued and the solicitation will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site. Interested sources are requested to provide a capability statement.  At a minimum, the statement should include the sources web site address; courseware catalog and/or description of courseware library; most relevant Government or corporate client (one client reference only) and POC information for this client; business size, socio-economic status, number of employees; and annual revenue for the last three fiscal years.  (Response not to exceed 5 pages; page limit does not apply to advertising material s uch as company brochures and courseware catalogs.) IMPORTANT.  Vendors are requested to answer the attached questionnaire in their response to this synopsis.  (Answers not to exceed 20 pages, including the 7 questionnaire pages.)       IN ADDITION, comments are requested on the acquisition and pricing strategy, e.g., suitability for unrestricted competition or set-aside; pricing methodology; recommended evaluation factors, etc.  (Comments not to exceed 5 pages.)  Responses shall be single-spaced, 12-point font, and not less than 1 inch margins.  Note page limits set forth above.  Compliance with the instructions in this synopsis will be considered in evaluating the vendors capabilities.     In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), a response to this synopsis is not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Response to this synopsis is voluntary.  The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this synop sis, nor pay for information provided in response to this synopsis.  This information will not be returned.   Corporate information marked proprietary, such as non-public pricing or bid strategy, will be safeguarded accordingly.  However, the Government may use comments or suggestions about the e-Learning acquisition strategy in any way that the Government choos es.  NOTE.  The final requirements and acquisition strategy for the e-Learning program may be different from that described in this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>The Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Compliance Policy was mandated by the United States Congress to contract with educational institutions and not-for-profit research institutes for a research project improving the resiliency of the financial sector to recover from disaster scenarios through development of new secure, remote, financial transaction backup storage systems.  As directed by Congress, the research will be conducted to identify ways to transfer and replicate data over longer distances and to protect data from being manipulated or distorted.  

Research will be required that uses commercially available locations, networks, and products to determine the parameters associated with data replication and database recovery activities.  Test environments need to be created that replicate these conditions to determine real world data transmission capacity, setup times, error rates, security requirements, and costs.  Computer operational sites separated by as much as a thousand miles, with databases in the terabyte range and commercial size servers need to be connected via commercial networks, including the Internet, to protect the customer, the transaction data, and data critical to ensure the continued operation of our nation’s banking and financial institutions.

The effort required by this project will be conducted using the facilities of e-Cavern, a secure underground technology facility located in Louisville, KY.  e-Cavern provides a hardened storage facility which provides the enhanced security that is now a requirement to protect critical financial data. It provides a naturally cool operating environment, ideally suited to run computer systems without the need to construct new cooling units.   The facility is unique in that it is near an international airport and is fully supported by the telecommunications infrastructure needed to move large packets of data in this project.  Additionally, its location away from the major financial centers creates geographic diversity that is a requirement to protect against regional disruptions and ensure business continuity.   e-Cavern will house the primary research test bed and will be the site of all testing activities. 

Interested educational institutions and not-for-profit research institutes may request the RFP from the Treasury Contract Specialist, Alan Cornwall, through email requests at alan.cornwall@do.treas.gov. A pre-proposal conference will be conducted on or about June 29, 2005 at the e-Cavern facility in Louisville, Kentucky. The time and place for the conference will be announced in the RFP. Questions and/or clarification requests related to the RFP must be submitted by to the contract specialist by June 23, 2005 by email at alan.cornwall@do.treas.gov. Responses will be provided at the pre-proposal conference. Treasury will use the questions and clarification requests to determine if changes to the RFP will be necessary. Proposals will be required on or about July 18, 2005.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AMENDS THE PREVIOUS SYNOPSIS N68711-05-R-BOA TO INCLUDE ALL FIRMS WITH A BONA FIDE PLACE OF BUSINESS WITHIN ONE OF THE FOUR SBA DISTRICTS (SAN DIEGO, SANTA ANA, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA AND PHOENIX, ARIZONA).  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest Division is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, California and Phoenix, Arizona) to participate in a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) program.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The period of performance for the first year of the BOA will end on April 24, 2006, with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to four years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest Division and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement.  Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.  Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed.  If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts.  The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).  Only NAICS code sectors 236, 237 and 238 pertain to this BOA.  Each firm will identify their primary NAICS and a secondary NAICS (if applicable).  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, however there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000 per firm over the life of the agreement.  Individual task orders will range between $2,000 and $500,000.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.  Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  The Contracting Officer will open /advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year.  Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly.  No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate.  Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued.  The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder.  Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.  This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party.  Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation.  Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA.  Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA.  Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible.  To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) developmental stage participant (Joint Venture/Mentor Protégé firms are not allowed) prior to the submission date of 24 June 2005; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, CA and Phoenix, AZ); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) http://www.bpn.gov; and VETS-100 http://vets100.cudenver.edu/ (if not applicable, provide statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,000 - $500,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS sectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years.

Although price is the least important evaluation factor, it will not be ignored.  The degree of importance of the proposed price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be based.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price or to the quote with the highest technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government}.

SECTION C – DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT
C.1    INTRODUCTION
C.1.1.   Background
This statement of work is for a BACKUP DISASTER RECOVERY SITE for the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), Office of the Secretary, Office of the Chief Information Officer, Office of Computer Services (OCS).  The Office of Computer Services (OCS) has years of experience providing IT hardware and software infrastructure support services; originally as the Departmental computer center for DOC and now, as a government franchise.  OCS’ synergistic approach to combining IT services with common administrative information system offerings has resulted in a growing and diversified product, service, and customer set.

OCS currently provides infrastructure and operational support for IBM mainframes, a Sun Solaris, and Windows servers.  Our diverse platforms are interconnected utilizing state-of-the-art telecommunication equipment and protocols including but not limited to CISCO routers, network hubs, modems, SNA, frame relay, and TCP/IP.

The computer center is staffed and operated 24 hours per day, Monday through Friday, and 16 hours on Saturday.  The remaining (4) shifts are an unattended operations environment.  The workload is heavy and unpredictable, and hundreds of users’ daily productivity depends upon system availability, rapid interactive response, and fast batch turnaround times.

The mission of OCS is to operate a central Enterprise IT resource facility to support the Office of the Secretary, DOC Bureaus, and other federal agencies.  These services include, but are not limited to: on-line and real-time interactive processing; batch processing; teleprocessing services and systems for textual (word) processing; data conversion and entry, and technical data base management and interactive program development.

Virtually all of the projects that contribute to the customer’s missions make use of information technology resources provided by OCS.  It is the responsibility of OCS to provide the ongoing support that is essential to these projects in the event of a disaster affecting the OCS supported infrastructure.

C.2    PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF CONTRACT
C.2.1    Purpose of Contract
The purpose of this procurement is to acquire disaster recovery services that will enable OCS to continue its computer processing in case of an emergency or disaster.  This contract shall be for one year with four option years.   

An emergency or a disaster is defined as any event, whether natural or man-made, such as: fire, power failure, water damage, bombing, natural disaster, errant hardware/software, etc., which would hamper or stop the critical processing directly related to OCS’ overall mission.

The determination that an emergency or disaster exists, and its extent, will be at the sole discretion of OCS.  However, OCS will not use the backup site to process excess workload regardless of the nature of the work or its importance.

C.2.2   Scope of Contract
The Offeror shall furnish, as required, the equipment, site location, power, office space, and other Offeror support services required for the support of all items supplied under this contract.  Such equipment, site location, power, office space, and other Offeror support services shall be supplied in conformance with the terms and conditions of this contract.  The location of the backup site shall be at least 75 air miles and not more than 300 air miles from the OCS Computer Center located in Springfield, Virginia.  

C.3   MANDATORY SPECIFICATIONS
The following paragraphs prescribe mandatory specifications as well as the performance, functional, compatibility, physical, and other salient characteristics, which are essential to satisfy the Government’s needs.  These specific requirements for equipment, site location, power, office space, and other services shall be complied with in responding to this solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
