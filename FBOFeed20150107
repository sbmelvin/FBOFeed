<p><br />FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Controllable Contested Environment (CCE)</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA RIK-2015-0003</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800 &amp; 12.910</p>
<p><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory - Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for research, design, development, concept testing, evaluation and experimentation with Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Intelligence (C4I)-related information and communications technologies/techniques supporting the implementation and use of a controllable contested environment (CCE). In particular, this effort seeks to assess advanced communication, networking and RF technologies and concepts.<br /><br />AFRL's Stockbridge facility is a 300 acre site that hosts a Controllable Contested Environment (CCE). This environment can be used to create a "real-world RF contested environment" where RF transmissions and receptions can be controlled and measured. Stockbridge also hosts Small Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) flight operations from two 600 foot runways. This capability enables small payload packages to be flown in support of CCE and related experimentation. Additionally the site hosts microwave and optical line-of sight communication links with reach-back to AFRL/RI in Rome, NY and AFRL/RI's Newport Test Site located in Newport, NY.</p>
<p>The characteristics of today's electromagnetic environment, communications and networks may limit our combat effectiveness, especially in contested, degraded, operationally limited (CDO), and anti-access area denial (A2/AD) environments. The Stockbridge Controllable Contested Environment may be used to emulate the battlefield environment in cyberspace by hosting a very diverse set of tactical analog and digital communication systems, wired and wireless sensor and C2 networks. The CCE will have the flexibility and adaptability to create this complex RF and Cyber environment. Together the CCE and the SUAS enable the testing of emerging C4I capabilities on mobile platforms in near real-world environments.<br /><br />This BAA seeks white papers that propose new capabilities that will support the warfighter in an anti-access area denial (A2/AD) and contested spectrum environment. These technologies should focus on information technologies including communications, networking and RF technologies. Enhancement of capabilities of the Stockbridge Controllable Contested Environment (CCE) will be considered of secondary benefit. Potential efforts in this area may include technologies and techniques to control, monitor, configure and analyze the RF and spectrum environment. They may also include assessment, instrumentation and configuration and control of experimental systems. As new warfighter challenges emerge, new tools will be required to improve the usability, adaptability, and functionality of the CCE and SUAS environments.</p>
<p>Areas of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<p><strong>Research and Development <br /></strong><br />The battlefield in cyberspace today hosts a very diverse set of tactical analog and digital communications systems, wired and wireless sensor and Command and Control (C2) networks that are costly to maintain and lack the flexibility and adaptability to respond and adjust to changes in the environment. Radio and network cognitive capabilities are needed to autonomously anticipate and understand changes within the environment and be able to reconfigure and operate in the presence of interference or a threat by leveraging cross layer adaptability. The goal is enhanced warfighter mission assurance delivering the right information, at the right time, to the right place. Technology areas include, but are not limited to: Dynamic spectrum adaptation, RF environment adaptation and assessment, cognitive RF and networking techniques, Waveform development experimentation and assessment, communications and networking technologies for disadvantaged, deployed and small UAS environs, spectrum sharing techniques and assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Integration</strong></p>
<p>The Controllable Contested Environment and Small UAS experimentation capabilities provide an environment for integrating multiple technologies and concepts together in an experimental environment. This capability can facilitate experimentation with and assessment of new C4I capabilities that support the warfighter in an A2/AD environment. Whether the capability augments the existing CCE/SUAS or a warfighter capability, tools must facilitate an open architecture and support plug and play features to enable flexible test and experimentation set-up, execution and tear down.</p>
<p><strong>Demonstration, Experimentation and Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The CCE/SUAS capability provides a venue for demonstrating and evaluating emerging C4I capabilities. Demonstration and experimentation must define and develop the scenarios, tools and methodology that will support showcasing and assessing the merits of the capability in a realistic environment (A2/AD, congested, contested, etc). This may require modifying scenarios and the environment as necessary, as well as the instrumentation and data collection tolls and methodologies required. Provide tools to capture and analyze the specified Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness for the defined scenario. Advanced techniques for Data Management and Data Security are also of interest.</p>
<p>Successful Offerors will be provided access to the Stockbridge CCE and SUAS areas on a non-interference basis, during normal duty hours. Access may include access to AFRL-Rome Research Site (RRS) Building 3 if required. Access will include space for experiments at Stockbridge in Buildings 1477 &amp; 1480, as well as space in the CCE shelters distributed throughout the site. All space and personnel access requirements will be coordinated on a per effort basis, but in general space in a shelter would be one person, one computer plus 24 vertical inches of 19 inch rack-mount space. Space in building 1477 would be approximately 150-200 sq. ft., including bench and rack space, plus seating for up to 4 persons (for experiments only, no office space is available).</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. FUNDING: Total funding for this BAA is approximately $9.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY15 - $1.9M; FY16 - $2M; FY17 - $2M; FY18 - $2M; and FY19 - $2M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts normally ranging between $100K to $1M per year. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received, subject to the availability of funds. All potential Offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>
<p>2. FORM. Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements, depending upon the nature of the work proposed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. ALLOWABLE CHARGES: The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have a government approved accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). IMPORTANT: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <br /><a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab<br />=core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">descending order of importance</span></strong>, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any)</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. <strong>STEP TWO INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," May 2012, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Aug 2013, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;<br />tab=core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>
<p>This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>
<p>5. SUPPLY CHAIN RISK: The provision at DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk (Nov 2013) applies.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>

18.  Set-aside:  100% Set-Aside
19. First Article: First Article Government Test Required for Approved Sources Other Than the OEM Pratt & Whitney 


20.  Mandatory Language:
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.

<DESC>FBO ANNOUNCEMENT: PRESOLICITATION NOTICE
<p>SUBJECT: OPTICAL TABLE SYSYEM</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB620040-15-00542</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: January 21, 2015</p>
<p>CONTACT POINTS: Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, 301-975-6205<br />Harry Brubaker, Contracting Officer, 301-975-8330</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA for the purchase of an Optical Table System under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR 13.106 - (b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:</p>
<p>A sole source determination is based on the following: Only Newport Corporation can meet our technical requirements.</p>
<p>Specifically no other vendor can meet the NIST requirements for:</p>
<p>An Optical Table System with the following specifications:</p>
<p>The system shall consist of:<br />(a) One optical table (5ft x 12ft x 18 in.) with a set of four vibration isolators (16 inch tall) <br />(b) A modular optical table set consisting of three optical tables (two 5ft x 12ft x 18 in. tables and one 5ft x 7ft x 18 in. table) that are connected together to form a monolithic U-shape, and a set of 9 vibration isolators (16 inch tall).</p>
<p>1) To accommodate all of the planned equipment and optical setups, three 5 ft. x 12 ft. x 18 in. and one 5 ft. x 7 ft. x 18 in. optical tables are required. Of the four tables, three of them (two 5 ft. x 12 ft. x 18 in. and one 5 ft. x 7 ft. x 18 in. tables) should be configured to be connected together to form a U-shape. The fourth table (5 ft. x 12 ft. x 18 in.) should be configured for independent use.</p>
<p>2) For the set of three-tables to be connected in a U-shape, the manufacturer should tune the vibration dampers in the assembled U-shaped table to minimize low-frequency fundamental modes typical of such monolithic systems. Since the composed monolithic structure such as a U-shape can exhibit very low fundamental frequency modes, the assembled table system should be tuned for damping as a monolithic system.</p>
<p>3) For mounting of optical components, all four tables must be tapped with 1/4"-20 holes on a 1" grid.</p>
<p>4) To enable mounting of optical components close to the table edge, the tapped holes must extend all the way to 0.5" away from the table edge on all sides in all four tables.</p>
<p>5) For locating the position of mounted optical components, the hole-pattern must be labeled (e.g., using an alphanumeric scheme) in each table.</p>
<p>6) For microscopy experiments, the table-tops in each table must be flat to with +/-0.005 inches.</p>
<p>7) For sufficient rigidity of the tables, the top and bottom skins must be 3/16" stainless steel.</p>
<p>8) To avoid degradation of the tables due to potential spills and other environmental factors, each table-top must use corrosion-proof sealed holes and the table-core must be sealed.</p>
<p>9) To avoid degradation of the tables over time, none of the tables should include composite of plastic materials in between the skin and core honeycomb.</p>
<p>10) For each table, the static deflection under concentrated 250 lb. load placed in the center of the table must be less than 5 x 10-5 in.</p>
<p>11) The maximum dynamic deflection coefficient must be less than 5.0x10-4.</p>
<p>12) The maximum relative motion between two points on the table must be less than 2x10-8 inches, when the table is subject to an applied power spectral density of 10-9 g2/Hz (g is the acceleration due to gravity) and the isolator transmissibility is 1%.</p>
<p>13) Each table should exhibit a Q-value (corresponding to the maximum amplification at resonance) to be less than or equal to 2.</p>
<p>14) To ensure that each table performance meet specifications, the vendor must provide independent third party test data showing the table performance with respect to dynamic deflection and relative motion.</p>
<p>15) To achieve the correct working height, the table must come with 13 vibration isolation legs (9 for the U-shape table and 4 for the independent table) that put the table top at a height of 34" (a range of 32" to 36" is acceptable).</p>
<p>16) Each vibration isolation leg must have a load capacity of 2000 lbs, in order for the legs to support the table and heavy equipment that might be placed on the table.</p>
<p>17) The vibration isolation legs need to be automatically re-leveling and self-centering to ensure that they respond to additional loads without requiring re-adjustment by the user.</p>
<p>18) Each vibration isolation leg must include a height adjustment system that allows for table leveling and independent height control for height compensation in floors that are not level.</p>
<p>19) The vibration isolation legs shall have maximum vertical and horizontal transmissibility resonance frequencies of 1.5 Hz at 80 psi.</p>
<p>20) The vibration isolation legs should be independent of each other and not connected using tie-bars to remove any structural resonances in the tie-bar system. The elimination of the tie-bar would also provide additional necessary accessible storage space under the optical table.</p>
<p><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (EST) on January 21, 2015. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Christopher.ganey@nist.gov.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A </span>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>NOT</strong></em></span> A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP)
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information from industry on establishing a campus-wide commercial wireless Internet service to support the Air University education mission. The Government considers information on market capabilities, common industry standards, latest technological advances, commercial terms and conditions, timelines for adaptation and integration, and possible suppliers and sources to be helpful. All feedback and information received may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a possible future acquisition. This notice is issued solely for market research and planning purposes and does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. Request any questions concerning clarification of this RFI be received by noon (12 PM CST) on 19 Jan 15 to allow time to post a response that could possibly affect an RFI response. No award will be made from this RFI and the Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.<br />Responses:<br />This RFI is prepared for planning purposes only and is not restricted to small business. If the government decides to pursue an RFP, portions of your RFI response may be incorporated into the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Sources are discouraged from submitting any information deemed competition-sensitive or proprietary. However, if sources elect to submit competition-sensitive or proprietary information, sources bear sole responsibility for marking said information as such to ensure appropriate safeguarding by the Government. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned. <br />After review of the responses to this RFI, the Government may or may not proceed with an acquisition. Information the government releases related to this RFI will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities site (www.fedbizops.gov). It is the potential service provider's responsibility to monitor this site for new information related to this RFI.<br /><br />Request for Information / Questions:<br />Air University (AU) is considering providing a commercial wireless Internet service to the student population of Air University (approximately 7,000 students) attending AU schools. In addition, the service would be provided to AU faculty and staff actively involved in academic research (approximately 700 personnel). The service provider's service model is expected to include an end-to-end solution whereas no Government furnished equipment is required. Existing communication rooms may be made available to host vendor equipment. Coverage may potentially encompass approximately 30 AU buildings. Typical location types where the service may be required include: classrooms, faculty/staff offices, dorm rooms, common areas, auditoriums and conference rooms.<br />In order to develop any potential acquisition strategy the following information is being sought:<br />1. What is the estimated cost to provide the infrastructure and commercial Internet service? Information provided will be useful in developing decision points for planning and the potential implementation of services based on initial set-up costs and continuous service fees.<br />a. Provide pricing model for initial installation of infrastructure (i.e. lines, wired drops, wireless routers, and switches) equipment required to provide the entire AU Campus with commercial Internet service based on information from attachments 1and 2.<br />b. Provide pricing model for commercial wireless service access to classrooms, faculty/staff offices, dorm rooms, common areas, auditoriums and conference rooms based on information from attachments 1 and 2.<br />c. Provide pricing model for end-to-end service by location type (i.e. classroom, faculty/staff office, dorm room, etc.) based on information from attachments 1 and 2. Cost model for each location type should include the following components:<br />i. Initial Investment <br />ii. Recurring Service Fee<br />iii. Service Commitment Duration<br />2. What is the estimated timeline to configure the infrastructure and provide the commercial Internet service?<br />a. Initial installation of lines and equipment to each building based on information from attachments 1 and 2.<br />b. Initial installation of lines and equipment to the entire AU Campus based on information from attachments 1and 2.<br />3. Air University's preference would be for all equipment to be supplied/installed/supported/maintained by the vendor. What options are available to provide for equipment maintenance and upgrade support (i.e. Service Level Agreement(s) (SLAs))?<br />a. What pricing models are associated with each SLA option? <br />4. What executive services (customer service/help desk) are available to ensure real-time support for connectivity issues? <br />5. What service delivery options do you provide (i.e. provide service to service delivery point and provide service to the user)?<br />6. What possible peripheral or allied support will be required from the Government to support this service?<br />7. What (if any) Blue Socket functionality is available for maintaining control on the commercial service? <br />a. What is the viability and estimated costs associated with the various controls that are available?<br />8. What performance metrics could be made available to the government related to usage?<br />9. What services are available which provide service protection, detection, response, and notification? <br />a. Are there any additional costs to the Government associated with providing these services?<br />10. What options are available to defer upfront setup costs if the Government chooses to employ an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) or Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) type contract? (Requires commercial Internet service infrastructure (Last Mile) to exist to a specified point (building location, drop points in rooms, etc.), which would allow customers to easily activate Internet service as needed)<br />11. Are there any other aspects that should be considered by the government as it refines the requirement and potentially develops an acquisition strategy?<br />12. What infrastructure-based controls (equipment or service) options are available to ensure wireless signal access points (APs) adjust the channels they use to avoid co-channel interference and also reduce non-Wi-Fi interference from bluetooth devices, cellular antennas, microwave signals and other wireless devices, while maintaining optimum bandwidth levels for all users? <br />13. What quality of service (QoS) features do you offer that help voice, video, and other latency-sensitive traffic get priority treatment over regular data?<br />14. What feature(s) will your infrastructure offer to ensure "airtime fairness" and prevents clients from monopolizing resources?<br />If additional information is required to formulate your response to this RFI, request the information through the POC listed below.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  This announcement serves as a Sources Sought (SS) synopsis issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  This SS is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation nor is this notice a request for quotation.  DO NOT submit a quote or proposal in response to this synopsis. The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Redstone Arsenal seeks potential business sources to perform a five (5) year contract for technical, engineering, and logistics services and provide 100 percent of parts to support the Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD) in the overhaul of the T-55 (NSN 2840-01-458-5361) family of engines applicable to the Chinook (CH-47) Helicopter.  This is a Critical Safety Item requirement. CCAD is the center for technical excellence in repairing, overhauling, testing, and modernizing the Army's fleet of rotary wing aircraft. The depot also provides worldwide on-site maintenance services and aircraft crash analysis. This effort will be a performance-based, fully integrated effort that includes the technical and engineering support and the materiel integration function necessary to support CCAD in overhauling, repairing, testing, and modernizing the Army's fleet of rotary wing aircrafts.  The contractor must be able to provide the full range of services and parts in order to meet the Government's requirement.  The contractor must provide technology insertion, technology refreshment/modernization of components, obsolescence management, spare parts and test cell upgrades and operational proficiency in support of reliability improvements for the engines. The contractor must have the background design knowledge, experience, and data necessary to support technical, engineering, materiel, and modernization capability as well as a ready source of engineering support and a qualified pool of vendors to supply parts in compliance with the original design intent.  The contractor must provide AMCOM's depot maintenance engineering with technical and engineering assistance based on OEM's product design and logistics database and develop work scope and process improvement recommendations in support of the overhaul and repair functions at CCAD.  The contractor must assist and advise CCAD in establishing commercial best practices in the areas of production planning, production control, materials management and process engineering. The contractor must develop overhaul and workstations kits to streamline CCAD component production and ensure availability of all spare parts required in overhaul.

<DESC>1.   Reference previous Request for Information (RFPI) issued on May 13, 2011 under Solicitation Number W58RGZ-11-R-0314 and RFI issued on November 7, 2013 under Solicitation Number W58RGZ14R0046, both Classification Code:  J - Maintenance, repair & building of equipment. <br>  <br> 2.   This sources sought notice is being published in accordance with FAR Parts 10.002 and 15.201 and is a Request for Information only in support of a market survey.  Issuance is for planning purposes only, to assist in identifying potential sources capable of supporting PMO NSRWA (Non-Standard Rotary Wing Aircraft) Worldwide Logistics Support Services - Depot for Non-Standard Rotary Wing Aircraft.  An Industry Day and RFIs were previously conducted under Solicitation Numbers W58RGZ-11-R-0314 and W58RGZ-14-R-0046. However, those notices included multiple requirements; e.g. training, aircraft modifications/depot level maintenance and contractor logistic support.  Although responses to previous RFIs will be utilized in completing the final market survey, this RFI is being issued specific to the NSRWA (located in Huntsville, AL) depot service requirements. This RFI includes additional information; DRAFT Performance Work Statements (PWS), and market research questionnaire. <br>  <br> 3.   Potential contractors responding to this notice shall be required to provide all personnel, materials, and supplies required to perform support and services as detailed in the DRAFT PWS (Attachment 1). <br>  <br> 4.   This is only a Sources Sought notice and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quote (RFQ).  A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. The Government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to this notice.  Responses to this sources sought notice will be used for a market survey analysis that will assist in determining if the contemplated acquisition could be conducted under full and open competition, or if the contemplated acquisition should be set-aside for small business pursuant to FAR Part 19 Small Business Programs. The Government is contemplating North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code 336411, Aircraft Manufacturing with a size standard of 1,500 employees. Respondents shall indicate in their response whether they qualify as a small business or qualify under other specialty designated programs such as VOSD, HUD, 8A, or others under this NAICS code. <br>    <br> 5.   For the purposes of market analysis, the Government is seeking to understand the capability and capacity of interested firms.  If you are a small business, and if the Government were to set this acquisition aside for small business, you would be required to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting and 13 CFR 125.6 (known as the 50% rule). Rules on affiliation and joint ventures are at FAR 19.101, Size Standards, 13 CFR 121.103, 13 CFR 124.513 and 13 CFR 125.6. Under the 50% rule, where the preponderance of support is for services, at least 50% of the cost of contractor performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business prime. The small business prime contractor must meet this requirement (1) individually, or (2) together with other small business members of a formal joint venture, or (3) together with a small number of small business subcontractors forming an informal joint venture, in which those subcontractors meet the definition of ostensible subcontractor as set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(4). Team members in such formal and informal joint ventures are exempt from affiliation rules under the conditions set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3). There is no limit to the number of other team subcontractors or size status of subcontractors.  <br>  <br> 6.   The Government anticipates prohibiting cross-teaming. Cross-teaming arrangements include a prime offeror participating as a subcontractor/team member with another prime contractor, or joint member/team member or subcontracting/teaming with more than one prime contractor. If acquisition is competed using full and open competition, then the subcontracting goal will be determined as a percentage of the overall contract value. <br>  <br> 7.   Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from industries responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. <br>  <br> 8.   The Government anticipates awarding a multiple-award indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) task order contract. The contractor must have the ability to maintain a SECRET facilities clearance and employees with a personnel security clearance at the SECRET level. <br>    <br> 9.   Interested parties are requested to submit a statement of capability outlining past work that is related to this requirement as identified in the PWS. The statement of capability shall include: <br>  <br> a. Vendor Information: <br>  <br> Name <br> Address <br> Point of Contact (POC), Phone Number, E-mail Address <br> CAGE Code <br> Small Business Category <br> Company's Business Size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size) <br> Brief Introduction of Company <br>  <br> b. Anticipated Teaming Arrangements, if available (delineate between work accomplished by prime, subcontractors and work accomplished by teaming partners). <br>  <br> c. Briefly Describe Your Relevant Contract Experience/Capabilities to support PWS  requirements: <br>  <br> Specific Aircraft Involved <br> Depot level aircraft support provided, i.e., overhauls, aircraft modifications, aircraft heavy maintenance <br> Foreign or Domestic employees <br> Contract Number <br> Prime or Subcontractor <br> Requirements Description <br> Total Contract Value (initial award amount, options, modification to include descriptions and values) <br> Place of Performance <br> Contract Organization <br> Organization Contract POC Name, Phone Number, E-mail address <br>  <br> d. Complete Market Research Questionnaire (Attachment 2).  <br>  <br> e. In an effort to develop a clear, concise, and accurate PWS, the Government is inviting interested contractors to review and provide comments on the attached PWS.  All comments will be considered, however the Government reserves the right to determine which comments may be incorporated into the final PWS. <br>  <br> 10.   Again, any information submitted by the respondents to this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. The company's standard format is acceptable; however, the limit for all responses is not to exceed twenty-five (25) single-sided, 12 font size, 8 x 11-inch pages. The 25 page restriction should include capabilities, market research responses, and questions/comments to DRAFT PWS. The submitted information shall be UNCLASSIFIED. Only electronic responses shall be accepted and shall be an attachment to emails. Responses shall be received no later than 12:00 P.M. (1200 hrs) Central Time, Wednesday, 28 January 2015. Each submission should be virus scanned prior to being sent via e-mail to the following Point of Contacts: <br>  <br> Kathy Hair <br> Contracting Officer  <br> kathy.l.hair.civ@mail.mil <br> 256-876-4223  <br>  <br> Olga Khazanov <br> Contract Specialist <br> olga.g.khazanov.civ@mail.mil <br> 256-313-5612 <br>  <br> 11.   Email submissions are subject to size and type restrictions (typically limited to less than 2 Megabyte in size and only non-executable attachments such as .doc or .pdf files) as well as any other appropriate network security measures. It is the respondent's responsibility to verify the package was received and can be viewed.  All responses must address each of the above stated requirements. <br>  <br> 12.   Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement on Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi and flow through to Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) https://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, System for Award Management (SAM) is required. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. <br>

THE GOVERNMENT MAY ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE; HOWEVER, SHOULD SUCH REQUIREMENTS MATERIALIZE, NO BASIS FOR CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT SHALL ARISE AS A RESULT OF A RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT&nbsp;(E.G., USE OF SUCH INFORMATION AS EITHER PART OF ITS EVALUATION PROCESS OR IN DEVELOPING SPECIFICATIONS FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT REQUIREMENT).</p>
<p>CONTRACT/PROGRAM BACKGROUND: <br />Contract Number: HQ0516-14-C-0001<br />Contract Type: FFP<br />Incumbent and their size: Towne Group Media and Management, Small Business company <br />Method of previous acquisition: Sole Sourced</p>
<p>This service will begin on April 1, 2015. <br />Period of Performance: Base Period, with Four Option Years</p>
<p>Place of Performance: The DoD News facilities are located at 6700 Taylor Ave, Fort Meade, Maryland 20755. Additional facilities are co-located with the Public Affairs Briefing Studio and News Bureau in the Pentagon Building. Arlington, VA. Most DoD News operations are accomplished in the Fort Meade facility and the Pentagon Bureau located in the Pentagon; other work will be required in the National Capital Region, or within the continental United States. The Government will provide transportation from the Fort Meade facility to such other locations as required.</p>
<p>A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) the Government feel is essential to successful performance is attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the Defense Media Activity and the respondent's potential ability to meet DMA's requirement.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:</p>
<p>DMA is seeking specialized skills in support of DoD News broadcast in order to work with an existing staff of military and civilian Government employees. The Government requires a team to operate a television broadcast facility to include a robust news department, news control room, master control room, producers, reporters, writers, videographers, editors and graphic artists:</p>
<p>1. The channel requires production of live anchored news updates at the top and bottom of each hour, along with news/information and original long-form programs highlighting activities from each branch of the military as well as elsewhere within the Department of Defense. Example: "Studio 5" - a live-to-tape 30-minute talk show program providing the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and senior DoD leadership opportunities to address DoD topics.</p>
<p>2. Qualifications. All employees must have commercial broadcast experience within a medium or large market. On-line video resume examples may be required for some positions.</p>
<p>3. Contractor personnel are permitted, when required or advantageous to the Government to operate Government owned or leased vehicles in performance of duties. Contractor personnel must hold a valid driver's license issued by a U.S. state or the District of Columbia and have insurance.</p>
<p>4. Because television news production is by nature a collaborative process, all tasks shall be accomplished in close coordination by contractor management with the DoD News management and military staff. While the COR and DoD News management maintain primary control of the assignment process, daily newsroom activity is a constantly-changing pattern of interlocking client-customer relationships. A great deal of flexibility on the part of Contractor and Government personnel is essential.</p>
<p>5. The Government will exercise continuous supervision and control of all products and content on the DoD News Channel and defense.gov web stream that are provided to the contractor. These steps include product selection, concept, assessment of assets, theme, tone, approval of script, approval of edit, approval of graphics, when and in what show or program the content will reside and when approved products are aired or distributed. DoD News management will work directly with the contractors on-site project manager to assign tasks.</p>
<p>6. DoD News functions in a role similar to that of a commercial broadcast station. Therefore, timeliness of product delivery and/or technical performance is essential. Included in the news mission is the Radio/Televison Production Office (RTPO) which provides spots, 100-percent of finished products, which is reviewed by management at several stages of production, much like news throughout the broadcast day. It is also understood that regular changes are made in the broadcast day of on-air products, re-work of scripts, graphics and finished products is normal in such a creative endeavor and, with reason, does not reflect negatively on the Contractor.</p>
<p>7. DoD News requires the contractor to have access to freelance professionals on as needed basis to include: Videographer, Video Editors, Field Producers, Senior Producers, Newscast Producer, Newscast Director, Technical Director and Graphic Artists.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On behalf of 18F, a newly formed organization within the General Services Administration (GSA), GSA&rsquo;s Office of Integrated Technology Services (ITS) is seeking information about the agile delivery capabilities (e.g., user-centered design, agile architecture, agile software development, test-driven development, API-first design, DevOps) of vendors under GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-51. Information gathered from this RFI and other market research will assist GSA with developing an acquisition strategy for a potential Multiple Award Blanket Purchase Agreement under FAR 8.4.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NOTE: The government will not reimburse any respondent for any costs associated with information submitted in response to this RFI. The objective of this RFI is to promote collaboration with the vendor community and give vendors an opportunity to comment on their agile delivery capabilities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Requested Respondents</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -17.95pt; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2;">&#9679;<span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Vendors with Schedule 70 contracts, who have agile delivery capabilities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -17.95pt; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2;">&#9679;<span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Non-GSA schedule vendors, who may be interested in sharing information about their agile delivery capabilities with the government.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -17.95pt; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2;">&#9679;<span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Companies who only specialize in one particular agile delivery area (e.g., DevOps) should also respond to this RFI.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Request for Information</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To ascertain your agile delivery capabilities, the government is requesting that you describe how you would approach creating a new and improved version of an existing government digital service called FedBizOpps (FBO).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">FBO, which you can view at http://www.fbo.gov, is used by government buyers to share information on federal business opportunities with the public. The system is intended to serve as the central portal for federal agencies to solicit products and services from commercial vendors in support of their missions. Using FBO, vendors can search, monitor, and retrieve opportunities solicited by the entire federal contracting community.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Based on this brief description of FBO, how would you go about designing, developing, testing, deploying and/or operating a new and improved system that produces such outcomes as user needs being met, risk of overall project failure (in terms of cost, schedule, quality) being mitigated, the architecture being adaptive to change, and taxpayer dollars being spent efficiently and effectively? Please be sure to include a listing of all the labor categories your company would use in this effort.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NOTE: The scenario above represents an exercise in a hypothetical project that will enable GSA to better understand your company&rsquo;s agile delivery capabilities. The government does not intend to release a solicitation to redesign FedBizOpps.gov based upon responses to this RFI.</p>

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) Division of Biochemical Toxicology (DBT) requirement for a Real-Time Label Free Cell Analysis System to monitor the effects of various drugs on cardiomyocytes.
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability and capability of Small Business Manufacturers or Small Businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotation, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is - 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Statement of Need<br />Numerous drugs have the potential for adverse effects on prolonging the QT interval, a marker for torsade de pointes (TdP), which can cause the heart to stop beating. The current FDA guidelines are very useful for identifying QT prolonging drugs, but some QT "positive" drugs have no demonstrable clinical risks of TdP. Researchers are aiming to establish an appropriate, strong pre-clinical proarrhythmia screening model that can directly measure and rank TdP risk and the influence of sex hormones. DBT requires a system that can monitor cells in real-time without the potential artifacts generated through the use of labels. DBT researchers require a non-invasive measurement method that allows detection of changes in adherence, morphology and viability without the need for over-expression of reporter and target proteins.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW)<br />General:<br />New instrument: The components and/or equipment shall be a newly manufactured, not used and refurbished, or previously used for demonstration.<br />The Contractor shall warranty all systems for parts and labor for a minimum of 12 months from date of Government's formal acceptance.<br />The Contractor shall provide in-side delivery, installation, and shall provide on-site training on the installed system.<br />Installation: The vendor shall demonstrate upon installation that the item meets all performance specifications. The instrument shall not be accepted until those performance specifications have been met. The system shall be delivered with all necessary supplies and accessories required for installation and start-up.</p>

<p>Agency/Office:<br />National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>Location:<br />National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions</p>
<p>Title: Resource for the Collection and Evaluation of Human Tissue, Cells, and Bio-fluids from Donors with an Epidemiologic Profile</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 622110 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the size standard for such requirements is $38.5 Million per annum. Statements should also include an indication of current certified business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern's name and address) as well as the eligible business concern's name, point of contact, address, and DUNS number.  The Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis (LHC), Division of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking capability statements from all eligible Small Businesses as stated above.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE. THIS IS STRICTLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>This contract is the essential resource serving the CCR, LHC research program. It supports molecular epidemiology studies of human lung, breast, prostate, liver and pancreatic cancer; as well as, the molecular pathogenesis and translational studies of all these diseases. LHC studies the induction of cancer directly in human tissues and cells. This requires a reliable source of fresh, professionally obtained human specimens.</p>
<p>The contract initially began as a pilot to obtain tissues for the experimental development of conditions to culture human specimens as organ and cellular tissues. The focus at that time was to obtain case-series cancer and adjacent uninvolved tissues from consented patients as they underwent surgery.  Cancer cases have been obtained primarily from the Baltimore Veteran's Administration Hospital, the University of Maryland Medical Center, and Johns Hopkins University Hospital (historically). Beginning in 1996, focus shifted to case-control studies which still included collection of material from cancer patients, but also healthy population based controls, recruited from the Maryland Department of Motor Vehicles records.  Population controls were recruited based on matching to the cancer cases by geographic location (Baltimore City, Maryland and surrounding selected counties), gender, and race (Caucasian, African-American, and Asian).</p>
<p>In addition to human tissues for research, the resource provides corresponding epidemiology profiles that include occupational histories, personal health history, family health history, smoking information, and exercise information via informed consent. Addition of medical record abstracts and pathological reports complete questionnaires.  Personal Identifying Information is excluded when data or samples are delivered to the NIH.  Further, the contract provides histology slides and histopathological interpretations by professionals. Unstained regular, standard and immuno-stained slides will be made available for staining and interpretation in LHC.  Three (3) previous contracts awarded competitively and entitled "Resource for the Collection and Evaluation of Human Tissues and Cells from Donors with an Epidemiology Profile." These included contracts: 00261199705D261971006, awarded 05/01/1997; 00261200105D261017011, awarded 05/31/2001, HHSN261200577000C, awarded 05/01/2005; and the current contract HHSN261201000117C, awarded 09/30/2010.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective:</p>
<p>The scope of this contract is to provide ongoing research to support molecular epidemiology studies of human lung, breast, liver and pancreas cancer and also provide human cancer and non-cancer tissue and primary cells for both in vitro and in vivo studies allowing the LHC to conduct studies.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>Organization will be required to:<br />1) Identify and recruit cancer cases and population-based controls<br />2) Obtain informed consent and maintain Internal Review Board approvals<br />3) Collect and store subject interview data, and<br />4) Collect and process biological specimens and transfer the de-identified materials (data and specimens) to the LHC.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance:</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement contract will be awarded with one (1) year base plus four (4) one (1) year option periods beginning on or about September 28, 2015.</p>
<p>Other Important Information:</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria: This criterion establishes conditions that must be met at the time of receipt of award.  Companies that fail to meet these requirements will not be considered further for award.</p>
<p>Capability Statements must clearly document your ability in the following area:</p>
<p>&bull;	Must demonstrate the ability to facilitate delivery of non-frozen viable tissues to the NIH campus within two (2) hours of receiving them from the pathologist, at all times of the day. The offeror is required to provide their address and distance from the NIH campus located at 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892-1360.</p>
<p>The offeror must be able to demonstrate past performance and expertise in (1) Technical Approach, (2) Organizational Experience, (3) Personnel and (4) Facilities.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Capability Statement/Information Sought:</p>

<DESC>1.  Introduction

This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to conduct market research.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  The RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or intent to issue a RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested contractor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

VA Central Office (VACO) Information Technology Services and Support (ITSS) Campus supports the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Project Manager System which is used to track the spending and the small Construction projects for all VA facilities nationwide.  This system is currently several version of Oracle database behind and there are various problems with the system that cannot be resolved until it is upgraded to the latest version of Oracle.  Failure to resolve the issues may result in a total system failure from which the VA will not be able to recover from.  The data on this database is instrumental in the maintenance and funding of projects for all the facilities nationwide.   VACO ITSS does not have employees that possess the skills or tools to upgrade the application and thus needs to solicit for these services.

Interested Contractors are advised that the Project Manager System contains procurement sensitive data.  Contractors may be required to submit an Organizational Conflict of Interest Plan including a Non-Disclosure Agreement in a potential solicitation.  Further, due to the nature of the procurement, Contractors performing on a potential award will be prevented from competing on future requirements being tracked in the Project Manager System.

Depending on the results of the RFI, VA expects this effort will be set-aside for small business.

<DESC>The USDA ARS Corn Insects and Crop Genetics Research Unit (CICG) in Ames, IA, intends to award procurement of an Organic Corn Winter Nursery to the University of Puerto Rico AES Research Office in San Juan, PR. This nursery will be managed by the USDA Organic Standards for producing corn. This nursery procurement will be conducted in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 13.106 and 6.303-2. The purchase determination is based on previous organic corn winter nursery experiments that have utilized this farm space. Establishing a nursery in a different location may introduce new variables to the ongoing experiments and impair comparison of results from previous experiments. Introduction of corn experiments in a new location may negatively impact results from numerous years of research and could be detrimental to ongoing research. This vendor has proven their ability to provide farm space, ability to operate within the necessary parameters of our research, provide the stock, pollinating and harvesting supplies needed and to provide the local temporary help to assist breeders during the 4 week pollination period. The cost has been determined fair and reasonable based on current technical knowledge of fair market value. The anticipated purchase order value is $27,000.00. This is not a request for quotation. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can obtain/provide the nursery space, supplies and labor required for this project. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to lara.j.hicok@aphis.usda.gov. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 11:00 am CST, January 12, 2015.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT TO SOLICIT QUOTES OR OFFERS BUT TO INFORM. The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(a)(C)(ii) specialized equipment.
The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Tishomingo National Fish Hatchery, intends to procure services to repair a 318C Caterpillar Excavator as a sole source. Due to the remoteness of the Hatchery and the size of equipment, it was determined the most efficient and economical means was to do a sole source procurement to the closes Caterpillar Dealer (27 miles)(next nearest dealer is 90+miles).  It currently is not operational due to safety and mechanical issues requiring repair to be put back into a fully operational status. This piece of equipment is vital to the success of our mission at varies different Refuges and Hatcheries. A justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. This serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a) (2). The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 811111; Size Standard is $7 M. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in preparation of proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 
Questions concerning this sole-source procurement may be directed to Tom Ketcham at tom_ketcham@fws.gov. No solicitation will be posted.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent of Increase Capacity of Contract N62470-12-D-7004, Small Business Environmental Remedial Action Contract (RAC).
<SOLNBR>N6247012D7004
<CONTACT>
<DESC>NAVFAC Atlantic intends to award a sole source contract capacity increase to AGVIQ, LLC pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1); only one responsible source, under Contract N62470-12-D-7004.  NAVFAC Atlantic intends to increase the contract capacity from $100,000,000 to $112,500,000 in order to allow sufficient time to award the follow-on procurement.  The work performed under this contract involves services in support of the Navys Environmental Restoration Program (ERP) in compliance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended by Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976.
  The contract capacity increase is necessary to continue vital work being performed under the RAC program and avoid costly delays that would occur should this work be halted.  While many of the contract actions that will be issued using this capacity increase will be modifications to current CTOs, it will be necessary to issue some new CTOs in order to continue work in accordance with regulatory schedules and perform essential projects in support of the Navys Environmental Restoration Program until award of the new contract is made.  AGVIQ, LLC has the resources in place to continue to provide these services without any interruption during the interim period.  Given the short time frame of the interim period, coupled with the time it would take to procure and phase in services from another contractor, AGVIQ, LLC is considered to be the only source capable of meeting NAVFAC Atlantics needs without a disruption of services.
  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested firms may identify and transmit their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to mary.lassiter@navy.mil no later than 4:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on 22 January 2015.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

INL manages the US contribution of personnel to the European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX). EULEX is a technical mission, which mentors, monitors, advises Kosovo Police (KP) and justice institutions, and retains a number of limited executive powers. Its central aim is to assist and support the Kosovo authorities in rule of law, specifically in the police, judiciary, and customs fields until the Government of Kosovo (GOK) is able to assume full responsibility for all law enforcement and judicial functions throughout Kosovo.</p>
<p>The Senior Police Advisor (SPA) provides day-to-day management and oversight of the U.S. contingent of American personnel (police, judges, prosecutors, and customs) seconded to EULEX. SPA serves as the Government Technical Monitor (GTM) and provides direct management of the Department of State contractor, currently Civilian Police International (CPI), which provides logistical and administrative support to the US contingent. SPA is also the primary liaison with EULEX in Pristina and in Brussels on personnel and program related matters. SPA also provides significant reporting to USEP on current in-country developments related to EULEX and other law enforcement related issues.</p>
<p>The management of this complex program and its importance to US foreign policy goals requires a full-time person with significant rule of law and/or law enforcement expertise to monitor and troubleshoot the day-to-day aspects of the program. SPA is also required to make recommendations on policy regarding police and other law enforcement structures.</p>
<p>The Purpose <br />SPA will assist in developing, implementing, and advising INL and USEP in the development, implementation, and management of US foreign policy regarding the continued deployment of Americans assigned to EULEX; the training, equipping, and development of the Kosovo Police (KP); and INL programming in Kosovo. SPA will support the INL Section at USEP.</p>

<p>Duties and Responsibilities<br />1. Oversee EULEX contract. Review invoices and ensure compliance with contract terms. Respond to Calls for Contributions, evaluate need for equipment and disposition, plan for downsizing, see that secondees are treated well, and respond to EULEX internal personnel issues.<br />2. Work with INL Program Assistant and oversee INL implementers in performance of work plans. <br />3. Assist with program development and make recommendations for USG funding priorities in Kosovo.<br />4. Support INL Director in preparation of cables, reports, and budget matters. <br />5. Assist in monitoring and evaluating EULEX deployment effectiveness in Kosovo, with special emphasis on EULEX activities and the unique policy matters relating to EULEX.<br />6. Evaluate current and potential EULEX policies and procedures in conjunction with senior EULEX policy officials, and make recommendations to the INL, USEP, and/or other international representatives as necessary.<br />7. Aid in monitoring bilateral project activities. Provide recommendations to INL on program progress and program adjustments needed.<br />8. Establish and maintain close working relationships with Regional Security Officer and other USEP offices for mutual exchange of information affecting the safety and security of U.S. personnel serving in the Mission. <br />9. Ensure that critical safety information and consular alerts are delivered to all Americans seconded to EULEX by INL, as required.<br />10. Aid in drafting written schedules of events for visiting official(s) and coordinate all activities and required support with proper internal and external Post personnel.<br />11.

<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>The State Department (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) program in the Republic of Georgia is funded from the Assistance to Eastern Europe and Central Asia (AEECA) account and the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account. AEECA is a comprehensive, multi-year regional initiative designed to provide U.S. foreign assistance to support democratic and economic transition in the former Soviet Union, by promoting economic and democratic reform, encouraging good governance, improving capabilities of law enforcement and criminal justice sector institutions to combat organized crime and narcotics trafficking, and by strengthening border security to secure against threats to regional stability. The INCLE account provides funding for international narcotics and law enforcement programs. INL programs focus on reforming law enforcement institutions and the criminal justice system, as well as building the capacity of justice sector institutions and actors in Eurasia.</p>
<p>INL assistance to the Government of Georgia's (GOG) probation and parole system began in 2012 and assistance to the corrections system started in 2013. The probation program focuses on development of risk assessment tools and processes for probation officers; case management procedures; statistical databases; and assistance to the community residential center. The corrections program supports ongoing prison reform through training, technical support, and capacity building in modern correctional practices that support prisoner rehabilitation and have a human rights component. These efforts are part of a much larger effort aimed at achieving a core U.S. national security objective. One means to this end is the promotion of greater security and rule of law in areas under the GOG's control, support that buttresses the foundations of a democratic state. The establishment of a stable, well-trained, and equipped probation and parole system is a GOG priority as it reforms its criminal justice system.</p>

<p><strong>Conformance to SOW</strong>: You must provide the computer assisted legal research in accordance with the SOW. Unless an exception is specifically noted within your quote, your quote will be considered to be in complete conformance to the solicited requirements.</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD</strong>: The Government will award to the responsible quoter whose quote is determined to be the "best value" to the Government, price and other factors considered. The factors that will be considered are Price, Research Tools and Customer Service. It is expected that trade-offs will exist between pricing and non-pricing factors and that vendors will be evaluated based on non-pricing factors and price. <strong>All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined, are greater than price.</strong> As non-price factors become more equal, the evaluated price becomes more important. Prospective vendors are advised that a quote meeting the objectives and requirements with the lowest price may not necessarily be selected if award to a higher price vendor is determined to be the best value to the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Vendor's should address the following in their quote:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESEARCH TOOLS</span>: The Government will evaluate the vendors' proposed research tools and technologies, including the cite check capabilities and the breadth of the databases (see SOW at paragraph 4).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CUSTOMER SERVICE</span>: The Government will evaluate the vendors' proposed approach to customer service, including at a minimum training, online/telephone assistance, webpage service, and personalization options.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRICE</span>: A table has been included as a separate attachment titled Schedule of Items Table to assist with submission of pricing for your convenience. The provided information should clearly identify the price per year for each office location for the base year and four option year periods.</p>
<p>To permit a through and effective evaluation, the quote should be as concise, complete and clear as possible so as to permit the Government to make evaluation of the quote without further information being required from the quoter. The Government reserves the right to make a determination whether a quote is acceptable or unacceptable solely on the basis of the information submitted and proceed without requesting additional information. <strong>Therefore, each response should be submitted in the most favorable terms satisfying the RFQ requirement.</strong></p>
<p>Option(s), inclusive of any potential extensions in accordance with FAR 52.217-8, will be evaluated at time of award. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY REQUIREMENTS</strong>: All work performed for this requirement is unclassified or is sensitive information covered by the Privacy Act of 1974 and other Department of Defense and DFAS regulations. Information Assurance shall be in accordance with DFAS 8500.1-R, Information Protection and Safeguards, DOD Directive (DoDD) 850.1, Information Assurance and DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8500.2, Information Assurance Implementation.</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written (formal) solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), solicitation number FA7000-15-T-0019, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 &amp; 13. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-78, effective 26 December 2014. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334515 with the business size standard of 500 employees. The acquisition is unrestricted. All responsible sources may submit a quote, which if received timely, will be considered by the 10th Contracting Squadron, LGCB, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).</p>
<p>This is a Brand Name only requirement.</p>
<p>Yokogawa is the only manufacturer the Government has found that can provide an optical spectrum analyzer with the unique combination of high sensitivity, high resolution, a broad wavelength span, and optical fiber inputs. The wavelength region the Government needs to study in our labs encompasses the output spectra of diode lasers and alkali gas cells. The Government needs high resolution so the pumping, probe, and flourescence lines coming from test samples can be determined. Yokogawa has a resolution of &lt;0.1 nm and a sampling resolution of 1 pm. No one else has been found to match this specification. In addition, Yokogawa has a huge dynamic range of over 40dB.</p>
<p>The government bares no legal liability for bid cost associated with this request for quote. Vendors should not submit a quote unless they are willing to absorb all cost associated with submitting a quote.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>1.&nbsp; This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The 106th Rescue Wing, New York Air National Guard, Westhampton Beach, NY intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with one or more hotels in the local area to satisfy lodging requirements for Air National Guard personnel during Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekends. The Government intends to enter into a BPA for one base year (January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015) with four (4) option years. The BPA will be reviewed annually; Lodging facilities must be within fifty (50) road miles of Westhampton Beach, Suffolk County, New York. This BPA will have a period of performance of five (5) years from date of agreement via issuance of Blanket Purchase Agreement Calls.</p>
<p>2. This requirement is unrestricted. See clause 52.212-2, quote mark Evaluation Procedures quote mark , for further details on evaluation procedures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 721110 (Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels) and the Size Standard for Small Business is $30 Million. The lodging requirement consists of establishing one or more BPAs, for a period of five (5) years from date of award, to hotels in the local area via issuance of BPA Call Orders. The Government may issue a BPA Call for a one (1) month period or a BPA Call for more multiple months up to the BPA Call Limit specified.</p>

All vendors must be U.S. Fire Administration/FEMA compliant. The government reserves the right to request a site visit with any offeror. Failure to comply with a site visit may disqualify a vendor from consideration.</p>

The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p>STATEMENT OF NEED<br />NFFP7230-15-00261<br />1.0 Organization</p>
<p>1.1 Organization: The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC), is a government agency charged with the mission of stewardship for living marine resources.</p>
<p>1.2 Background and Objective: The center provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise use of the Northwest region's marine and anadromous resources.</p>
<p>Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), also known as blackcod or butterfish, is a high value species found off the U.S. Pacific coast and Alaska. Due to dramatic declines in fishery production and continued high demand, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has identified sablefish, as a priority species for commercial farming in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Our group is developing methods for culturing sablefish. When these fish are young and transferring from getting their nutrients via yolk-sac absorption to eating live-feeds, we must keep a continuous culture of rotifers (Branchionus plicatilis) to feed them. At our peek production of rotifers we will feed out 4-6 liters of the concentrated algae Nannochloropsis sp. per day. Along with keeping live-feeds available year round, during the larval season we must also tint the culture water (greenwater), keeping the larvae off the bottom of the tank and distributed throughout the water column. During the entire larval season we will be using an additional 1-3 liters of Nannochloropsis sp. per day, just for greenwater. In total, at peak production we will be using up to 9 liters of concentrated Nannochloropsis sp. per day.</p>
<p>2.0 Services and/or Products Required</p>
<p>2.1 We require 600 liters of concentrated Nannochloropsis sp., at a density around 68 billion cells per/ml in 1 Liter containers. Shipments of the concentrated Nannochloropsis sp., will be primarily during the winter and spring and need to be flexible to meet the demands of the hatchery. Each shipment will be no less than 20 liters (30 shipments).&emsp;</p>
<p>3.0 Deliverables</p>
<p>3.1 To ensure our supply of concentrated Nannochloropsis sp., we would like monthly updates via phone or email between the vendor and point-of-contact.</p>
<p>4.0 Performance</p>
<p>4.1 Delivery time from the date order to arrival must ensure the product arrives cool and in proper condition.</p>
<p>5.0 Period of Performance</p>
<p>5.1 Date of contract being awarded through 9/30/2015.</p>
<p>6.0 Invoicing</p>
<p><br />The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's deliveries. The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />d. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />e. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by NFS representative at the time of delivery<br />Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all of the above requirements)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered prior to the bid due date, 20 January 2014. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 120 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 120 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition.  Evaluation Factors: SEE SECTION L & M INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS. <BR> <BR>The period of performance shall be for 120 days from award of contract for delivery, installation, inspection and acceptance. <BR> <BR>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2014)<br /> (a)  Purpose.  The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br /> (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br /> (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br /> (b)  Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br /> (c)  Warrant and Disclosure.  The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.  The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict.  The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.  <br /> (d)  Remedies.  The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest.  If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br /> (e)  Subcontracts.  The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br /> (f)  Prime Contractor Responsibilities.  The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest.  The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.  If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.  If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g)  Waiver.  The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS&nbsp;<br /><br />The evaluation factors below are not formal source selection procedures.</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award: Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable (LPTA), responsive and responsible Offeror. This is a competitive LPTA selection in which technical acceptability is considered the most important factor. By submission of its offer, the Offeror accepts all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All technically acceptable offers, with satisfactory past performance, shall be treated equally except for their prices. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The Government intends to select ONE contractor for award of this effort. For the purpose of award, the government shall evaluate offers based on the evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - Technical Acceptability (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 2 - Past Performance (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 3 - Price</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Acceptability<br />In order to be determined technically acceptable, the offer must clearly demonstrate capability to meet the following standards:</p>
<p>1. The offeror shall submit their Technical Capability Information as Volume I, and be no more than 3 pages.</p>
<p>2. The offeror shall demonstrate technical knowledge by providing the technical approach to accomplish assembly in accordance with MIL-A-8625 and MIL-STD-130 as required by the technical drawings.</p>
<p>3. The offeror shall demonstrate technical knowledge by providing the technical approach, including tools and equipment required to perform assembly of the ATDC Frames. Specifically, the offeror shall provide the following information: Tool Name, Manufacturer, Part Number, and a brief description of how the tool will be used during the assembly process. The technical approach will be evaluated for:</p>
<p>a. Compliance with Drawing 8554696.<br />b. Compliance with the requirements in the SOW.<br />c. Compliance with delivery schedule as detailed in the SOW.</p>
<p>4. The offeror's technical proposal shall enable Government evaluating personnel to make a thorough evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the proposal will meet the requirements of the Statement of Work. Each technical proposal shall be specific, detailed, and complete as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the prospective contractor has a thorough knowledge and understanding of the Statement of Work requirements. Proposals that paraphrase the specifications / Statement of Work or attest that "standard procedures will be employed" are inadequate to demonstrate how the proposal complies with the Statement of Work and will render the proposal "Unacceptable".</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors must not have unsatisfactory past performance. The Offeror shall not submit performance data for this factor. The government may seek relevant performance information on all responsive and otherwise Technically Acceptable Offerors through sources such as DCMA, CPARS, FAPIIS, or PPIRS; or other government databases and other available sources.

<p>5652.204-9003 Disclosure of Unclassified Information and Notification Requirements for Cyber Security Breaches (JUN 2013) <br />On September 21, 2001, the Department of Defense designated Headquarters US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) a sensitive unit, as defined by Title 10 United States Code (USC) Section 130b (10 USC 130b). In keeping with this designation, unclassified information related to USSOCOM military technology acquisitions managed by USSOCOM or any of its component commands, will be designated Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). As such, the contractor hereby unequivocally agrees that it shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor's organization any unclassified information, regardless of medium (e.g., film, tape, document, contractor's external website, newspaper, magazine, journal, corporate annual report, etc.), pertaining to any part of this contract or any program related to this contract, unless the Contracting Officer has given prior written approval. Furthermore, any release of information which associates USSOCOM, Special Operation Forces (SOF), or any component command with an acquisition program, contractor, or this contract is prohibited unless specifically authorized by USSOCOM.<br /><br />(a) Request for approval shall identify the specific information to be released, the medium to be used, and the purpose for the release. The contractor shall submit the request to the Contracting Officer at least 45 days before the propose date for release for approval. No release of any restricted information shall be made without specific written authorization by the Contracting Office.<br /><br />(b) The protection of sensitive but unclassified data reflecting Special Operations technologies, personnel, plans, and business associations requires due diligence on the part of those in possession of such information. The application of appropriate security measures to ensure the safekeeping of USSOCOM and company proprietary data, intellectual property, and personnel data is the responsibility of all parties who have access to such information. All contractors supporting USSOCOM are required to inform the Contracting Officer within three business days of when there has been a breach or successful penetration of the contractor's network(s) or information system(s). Breaches include unauthorized intrusions of the contractor's server(s) from external parties whether through introduction of malware, hacking, the compromise of access passwords, or any other unauthorized access or compromise.

Estimates of damage and mitigation strategies will be submitted to the Contracting Officer within a period following the breach specified and agreed upon by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall include a similar requirement to this clause in each subcontract under this contract.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

He shall protect all existing items within the work limits which are not specifically part of the work in the Contract and, at the completion of his work shall restore as necessary the work area to the "As Is" condition agreed to with the center prior to commencement of the work. If there is concern that the work area contains damaged elements that might appear as damage caused by the prosecution of the work, the contractor shall document the damage through memo or video tape the work area and provide a copy to the center prior to commencing any work. The center may make its own video of conditions, if desired.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On behalf of 18F, a newly formed organization within the General Services Administration (GSA), GSA&rsquo;s Office of Integrated Technology Services (ITS) is seeking information about the agile delivery capabilities (e.g., user-centered design, agile architecture, agile software development, test-driven development, API-first design, DevOps) of vendors under GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-51. Information gathered from this RFI and other market research will assist GSA with developing an acquisition strategy for a potential Multiple Award Blanket Purchase Agreement under FAR 8.4.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NOTE: The government will not reimburse any respondent for any costs associated with information submitted in response to this RFI. The objective of this RFI is to promote collaboration with the vendor community and give vendors an opportunity to comment on their agile delivery capabilities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Requested Respondents</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -17.95pt; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2;">&#9679;<span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Vendors with Schedule 70 contracts, who have agile delivery capabilities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -17.95pt; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2;">&#9679;<span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Non-GSA schedule vendors, who may be interested in sharing information about their agile delivery capabilities with the government.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -17.95pt; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2;">&#9679;<span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Companies who only specialize in one particular agile delivery area (e.g., DevOps) should also respond to this RFI.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Request for Information</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To ascertain your agile delivery capabilities, the government is requesting that you describe how you would approach creating a new and improved version of an existing government digital service called FedBizOpps (FBO).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">FBO, which you can view at http://www.fbo.gov, is used by government buyers to share information on federal business opportunities with the public. The system is intended to serve as the central portal for federal agencies to solicit products and services from commercial vendors in support of their missions. Using FBO, vendors can search, monitor, and retrieve opportunities solicited by the entire federal contracting community.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Based on this brief description of FBO, how would you go about designing, developing, testing, deploying and/or operating a new and improved system that produces such outcomes as user needs being met, risk of overall project failure (in terms of cost, schedule, quality) being mitigated, the architecture being adaptive to change, and taxpayer dollars being spent efficiently and effectively? Please be sure to include a listing of all the labor categories your company would use in this effort.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NOTE: The scenario above represents an exercise in a hypothetical project that will enable GSA to better understand your company&rsquo;s agile delivery capabilities. The government does not intend to release a solicitation to redesign FedBizOpps.gov based upon responses to this RFI.</p>

Request is for service agreement for full service support to include preventive maintenance and unlimited emergency repairs for the Siemens Nuclear Imaging systems including Symbia S Model#1235 system, Symbia S Model# 1390 system, 	 Symbia S Model# 1468 system, Symbia T16 Model# 120 system, Biograph mCT 64 system and Symbia.Net Single-User system .
The estimated value of this acquisition is $402,172.00 for FY15.	



    

   (b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $402,172.00	
	
       (c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE:   October 1, 2014	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
The Engineering Department is requesting labor, material and equipment to provide full service support for preventive maintenance and unlimited emergency service on the Siemens Symbia S Model#1235 system, Symbia S Model# 1390 system, 	 Symbia S Model# 1468 system, Symbia T16 Model# 120 system, Biograph mCT 64 system and Symbia Net Single-User system. Only the original manufacturer is able to maintain this complex and delicate equipment that is an integral part of the VAAAHS.
The service contract costs for these systems have been negotiated and a National Acquisition Center (NAC) contract was established for this work. This request is for a task order against contract# V797P-6029B for the period of October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015.

0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)
These specialty medical devices use proprietary software that precludes any other vendor form maintaining this equipment. Only the OEM, Siemens, is able to service the devices.	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	
     	
     	
0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
Siemens Medical Systems is the manufacturer of these systems. Siemens has maintained these 	
Systems while under warranty and after the warranty expired. Siemens Medical personnel have    provided timely service to these systems.  
The NAC has negotiated these special high tech medical equipment contracts to assist the field in  getting these services and the NAC contract price has been determined to be fair and reasonable.	
     	
     	
     	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
FSS schedules and the internet were searched; no other vendor performs service on Siemens high tech medical devices other than OEM.  


(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
Siemens is the manufacturer of the aforementioned equipment that requires a full service agreement and is the only vendor that is capable of providing the range of services specified by the manufacturer. The range of service that only Siemens can provide will prove beneficial in the overall cost effectiveness in maintaining and operating the Siemens Nuclear Medicine Imaging system. 	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	




(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
There are no known barriers to competition. Should a requirement of this nature recur, the market will be surveyed again.	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor's supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)
