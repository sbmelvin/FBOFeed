<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with SKC, Inc. 863 Valley View Road, Eighty Four, PA  15330, as the only responsible source that can provide a Deployable Vapor System (DVS) and a Deployable Cartridge Sampler.   . 

The DVS is a sampling system consisting a SKC Leland Legacy Pump and
specially designed sampling train contained in a ruggedized, small package to mimic much larger US Environmental Protection Agency approved sampling methodologies for collecting volatile organic compounds. It was designed and the sampling methodology validated by SKC in cooperation with the USA Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM)to collect ambient emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC)during military deployments. Samples are analyzed in a laboratory using the TO-17 Method. It is the instrument used across DOD for characterizing VOC in deployment locations. USACHPPM provides pre-conditioned sampling media used with this system and performs the chemical analysis of samples free of charge consistent with their responsibilities as lead DOD agent for Force Health Protection. One laboratory analysis costs more than a single sampler. DoD would also have to modify the training program as this is the instrument we've deployed for 3 years.

Similar to the DVS, the Deployable "Cartridge" Sampler is a joint venture between SKC and USACHPPM.  It, like the DVS, combines a Leland Legacy Pump with a specially designed sampling train for semi-volatile compounds, pesticides, dioxins and dibenzofurans (the really nasty (from a health perspective) contaminants that come out of burn pits and other combustion sources).  The DCS provides an USEPA equivalent method for sampling for these compounds which otherwise would require 2 distinctly different samplers a PUF Sampler and a PS2 Sampler.  Both of these combined are about the size and weight of a Volkswagen Beetle.  So, you can see why that wouldn't work in a deployment scenario. The DCS, on the other hand, is self-contained and fits in a pelican case a little larger than a brief case.  Also, similar to the DVS, 
USACHPPM loads the sampling media and pre-conditions the cartridges (either PUF or XAD)that we provide.  Expeditionary Medical Logistics Program has a requirement for 8 PUF and XAD Cartridges for each build.  

Regulatory Requirements:  The system and all of the components, shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.  The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures FAR 13.501 under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  There are not set-aside restrictions for this requirement.  The intended procurement will be classified under North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334519.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product.  All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

	Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to erin.cotter@med.navy.mil.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
This is a notice for: 1) Synopsis of Proposed Contract Action 2) Release of the DSS Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) and 3) Invitation to participate in the DSS Pre-Solicitation Industry Days.  


SYNOPSIS:
The Missile Defense Agency is informing all interested Offerors of a forthcoming competitive full and open solicitation (subject to OCI resolution) for the Decision Support System (DSS). The solicitation will be released, no earlier than 14 October 2009, utilizing FedBizOpps. The MDA intends to award a single Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the development, implementation, and sustainment of a DSS to support integrated program management of the BMDS.  Performance shall take place at the Contractor’s facility and multiple MDA locations to include the National Capital Region (NCR), Huntsville, AL (HSV), and the Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center (MDIOC), Schriever AFB, CO (COS). 

The NAICS code for this effort is 541512 - Computer Systems Design Services, which has a Small Business Size Standard of $25.00 M. This is NOT a Small Business Set Aside. For large businesses, the DSS contract will have a Small Business Subcontracting goal of 30%.

The anticipated dollar value of the DSS effort is $36,000,000.00 for a two year base period of performance and three one-year options.  Estimated contract award date is 2nd Quarter Fiscal Year 2010. Period of performance is anticipated to begin 1 Apr. 2010. 


OCI CONSIDERATIONS:
The acquisition of the Decision Support System services under the forthcoming solicitation may create actual or potential conflicts of interest (OCIs) for Offerors and their prospective subcontractors or other team members.  In assessing and addressing conflicts of interest, MDA will follow the guidance in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Offerors will be responsible for ensuring that they and their proposed subcontractors or other team members are not restricted from participating in the forthcoming Request for Proposal due to an OCI related to any MDA-funded contract or subcontract; Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) development, fielding and sustainment related contracts or subcontracts; or other significant, non-BMDS related business relationships with firms doing business with or in support of the MDA. 

It is MDA’s policy that, consistent with GAO and court decisions, impaired objectivity (bias-type) OCI’s cannot be adequately mitigated through firewalls and/or separate corporate divisions.  An impaired objectivity OCI is not mitigated if a contractor performs BMDS development, fielding or sustainment efforts and a firewalled affiliate and/or separate organizational component provides separate Decision Support System services. 

For purposes of this competition, therefore, MDA does not intend to award any contracts to any contractors, subcontractors, or other team members who also participate in a significant manner in the development, fielding or sustainment of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  Also, MDA does not intend to grant OCI waivers of bias-type (i.e. biased ground rules and impaired objectivity) as part of this procurement process when it relates to significant participants in BMDS development, fielding, or sustainment.

The solicitation will provide further information relating to impaired objectivity and other OCIs and how to have them addressed and preliminarily resolved prior to offer submission. Additionally, the solicitation will include a clause(s) in Section H that will establish restrictions and obligations to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate OCIs.


DRAFT RFP: 
A Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) is attached to this announcement for better understanding of the Agency’s desired outcome and review of the solicitation. Industry is encouraged to provide questions and comments regarding this draft solicitation. Questions and comments must be submitted via an e-mail titled ‘DSS DRFP Comments’ to DSS@mda.mil no later than 25 September 2009. It is anticipated that the Final RFP will be released in mid October 2009 via FedBizOpps. Potential Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for release of the solicitation package and any amendments.  

Note: The DRFP Offeror’s Library is available at this time. Regulations, manuals, or other publications referenced in the DRFP/RFP will not be issued with the Draft or Final solicitation.  Offerors must use the attached DSS Draft RFP Offeror’s Library Request Form to request a copy of the DRFP Offeror’s Library. The completed request form must be submitted by an e-mail titled ‘DSS Offerors Library Request’ to MDADSSLibrary@mda.mil .  Documents will be packaged and dispatched in DVD format within three (3) business days of receipt of request.  The Government will provide one copy per prime Offeror delivered through the United States Postal Service (USPS) to the mailing address provided. Company’s requesting a copy of the Offeror’s Library must agree to the handling and destruction requirements, as stated in the Draft RFP Offerors Library Request Form, of BMDS FOUO information. Access to this information shall be limited to only U.S. Persons who have a need to know. No pick-up service or physical location is available to review the documents contained in the Offeror's Library.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point has a requirement for TM-2000 Multi-Purpose Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) Platform, items listed below (0001-0016).  The Government intends to procure this requirement as a sole source basis from RONCO Communications & Electronics, Inc dba Ronco New England, 595 Sheridan Dr., Tonawanda, NY, cage code 1AL46.  RONCO Communications & Electronics currently holds the Extended Service Plan (ESP) maintenance contract.  The ESP provides the Emergency Technical Assistance Service (ETAS) support to  the inside plant personnel to maintain the Central Office (Nortel SL-100) Telephone Exchange.  The ACD must be able to interface with the Nortel Meridian SL-100 telecommunications switch.  Ronco is the only locally based in North Caorlina SL-100 service provider.  This system has previously gone through JITC and DAICAP enabling ease of installation and integration into the existing systems.  In order for a system to meet the general requirements for managing a reactive and highly supportive customer support call center, be acceptable for procurement through the department of defense, and integrate into the Nortel SL100 and an IA acceptable data network, it must be able to meet the following criteria:
- Current JITC Certification and listing on the Approved Products List (APL)
-  DIACAP certification and scorecard
- Nortel Enterprise Developer Partner
- Provide custom design menus
- Integrate with workflow management software including Remedy
- Have ability to monitor agent conversations real-time
- Have ability to record agent calls
- Have ability to backup agent calls to a central location on the network for future monitoring / score carding
- Have no agent licensing restrictions.  
- Have comprehensive and flexible web based reports that allow for HTML views as well as XLS exports and built in graphing
- Have Monitor Module software included with system to be used as a wallboard and display information on as many LCD screens as desired
- Have built in instant messaging

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, [Insert names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and e-mail addresses].

<p>(b) Past Performance Surveys: The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Provide a list of no more than five (5), of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three years.

<p>2. Evaluation Factors for Award.</p>
<p>General Information</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia has visitor control procedures requiring individuals not affiliated with the installation to obtain a visitor pass prior to entrance. SOME DELAY SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED WHEN HAND-CARRYING PROPOSALS. Late proposals will be processed in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(f) "Late submission, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) PAST PERFORMANCE<br />(2) PRICE</p>
<p>Past Performance is significantly more important than Price when being evaluated.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) Addendum</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause 52.212-1, Instructions to offeror, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and past performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount for each. The offers will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness of the proposed evaluated price.</p>
<p>B. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on the references provided by the offeror and data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant past performance includes performance of efforts involving the performance of services described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating.</p>
<p>C. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall past performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined herein. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will/will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. When no performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, the rating will be "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>D. Performance Confidence Assessment Rating. Past performance will be used as a measure of the Government's confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform based on previous and current contracts and support agreements. Past performance information may be obtained through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), questionnaires provided by the offeror (see part 2 of Addendum to</p>
<p>52.212.-1 - Instructions to Offerors), through Defense Contract Management Command Channels, through interviews with program managers and contracting officers , or other sources known to the Government. Data from previous source selections or contractor capability assessments will be used if the data is recent and relevant. A confidence assessment rating will be assigned to each offeror as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE - No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned</p>
<p>E. Performance Evaluation - Relevancy Ratings. To assist the Government's evaluation, each offeror's supporting past performance will be evaluated for relevancy as follows:</p>
<p>VERY RELEVANT - Past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>RELEVANT - Past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>SOMEWHAT RELEVANT - Past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>NOT RELEVANT - Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>F. Past Performance Evaluation - Recency:<br />Only past performance being performed within the last three (3) years of proposal due date shall be considered for recency.</p>
<p>G. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>H. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating and is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>I. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a " Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>J. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to the other than lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a past performance risk rating of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>K. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors - Commercial Item. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>L. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>

This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for the Development of Quality by Design (QbD) for Lyophilized Protein Parenteral Manufacturing Processes.  

Background Information:  

This project is part of an overall effort to develop a systematic framework for the realization of Quality by Design (QbD) for drug product development and manufacture in the spirit of International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidances Q8, Q9, and Q10.  The overarching goals of this research is to provide a scientific foundation for the development of QbD guidance elements on design space that will take into consideration the impact of product performance attributes such as stability, safety, efficacy and patient utility on the design space process.  

Objective:  

The project proposed here is designed to address the performance requirements and manufacturing constraints associated with lyophilized protein products for parenteral administration.  Protein pharmaceuticals present manufacturing and product performance issues that can be unique and troublesome because of their susceptibility to physical and chemical instability, unique safety issues (e.g. immunogenicity) and efficacy based not only on chemical purity but also on higher-order structural integrity.  Moreover protein pharmaceuticals are typically very surface active, highly potent and prone to molecular interactions (including self-association).  Taken together, these biophysical, biochemical and pharmacological attributes present significant challenges to the design and development of protein pharmaceutical products and manufacturing processes that are much less frequently encountered with small molecular weight drugs.  

The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of Quality by Design (QbD) approach as applied to the protein parenteral manufacturing processes.  In the current proposal, scientists from The University of Iowa, Purdue University, University of Connecticut, and Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions will work collaboratively with the FDA to develop a case study for protein parenteral dosage forms which can form the basis for constructing some of the guidance elements on this subject. 

Description/Statement of Work (SOW) 

A typical protein API (e.g. glucagon) that is widely available and is representative of many, if not all, of the special issues associated with protein pharmaceuticals will be chosen for this study. 

The work will involve the following steps:

1. Define the Critical Product Attributes of the Target Product Profile. The target product profile would include:

a. Potency, Physical Integrity and Chemical Purity 
       
API source and control strategy 

b. Maintenance of potency, purity and physical integrity upon reconstitution
      
Ability of the protein pharmaceutical to maintain chemical purity and physical integrity during thermal and mechanical stress associated with the aqueous reconstituted solution of administration can be a significant risk for product performance.  The rate of solution, propensity to aggregate or degrade, adsorption to package surfaces, interaction with packaging leachables or reconstitution solvent components can be potential problems. 

c. Formulation design and manufacturing issues manifested upon reconstitution
       
In addition to the possible issues arising from reconstitution process and solvent formulation design, various potential failure modes can be manifested upon reconstitution and ascribed to manufacturing and lyophilized formulation design.  For example pH control during and after lyophilization, interactions between formulation components, thermal history during freezing and the effect of collapse on reconstitution time can be relevant to product performance.  

d. Freedom from particulate matter
       
In addition to contamination by extraneous particulates or incomplete solubilization, protein pharmaceuticals are susceptible to interactions between protein and packaging components and self- aggregation leading high particle counts.

e. Stability
      
Protein pharmaceuticals can be susceptible to hydrolytic and oxidative chemical instability during manufacturing, storage, shipping, and/or use.  Hydrolytic instability can be influenced by moisture, temperature, pH and the presence of reactive exicipients (e.g. reducing sugars).  Headspace reactive gases and trace impurities have been associated with oxidation.  Moreover, proteins are susceptible to physical instability manifesting in higher order structural changes and/or aggregation.  Manufacturing, shipping, and use stresses (thermal and mechanical) can conspire with environmental conditions (pH, surfaces, concentration, co-solutes, etc) to induce physical changes 

2. Propose a formulation using key formulation design decisions: Pertinent formulation design decision will address both lyophilized protein formulation and reconstitution solvent compositions.  Decision will be based on the likely or demonstrate susceptibility of the protein to physical and chemical instability, lyophilization behavior, biocompatibility issues and intended pharmacotherapy requirements. 

3. Propose the manufacturing process: Manufacturing process unit operations will include preparation of drug solution for lyophilization, sterile filtration, freezing, primary drying, secondary drying, capping and sealing.

4. Conduct a risk analysis using cause and effect process (Ishikawa Diagram):  The objective of this step is to identify the variables that are like to impact the manufacturing process. 

5. Risk Evaluation: Classify the unit operations that are likely to have an impact on quality. 

6. Identify the critical operating variables and material property variables:  Screening studies will be used to identify variable that are like to have the maximum impact on the Critical Product Attributes. (Risk evaluation study using Risk = probability X impact and FMEA) 

7. Design of Experiments: Efficient designs will be constructed to handle multivariate statistical models guided by process understanding and/or mechanistic models.

8. Conduct the experiments in laboratory/pilot plant equipment. 

9. Develop Protein Formulation Design Space and Lyophilizer Design Space. 

10. Propose control strategy to reduce risk.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Solicitation number is W91RUN-9212-7001.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of any amendments or other pertinent information.<BR>This is a request for quotation (RFQ). This acquisition is unrestricted.  The Kentucky National Guard is soliciting for Training Small Arms Protective Inserts (SAPI) plates and Training Vest Inserts. Potential offerors are to review the specifications that follow: <BR>Item #1 - Training Small Arms Protective Inserts (SAPI) plates must closely replicate the size, shape, and weight of actual SAPI/ESAPI. Plates will approximate the curvature and dimensions of a medium-sized SAPI plate with a thickness of one inch, size dimensions of 9.5 X 12.5 inches, and weight of 4.0 lbs. Surface finish will be moderately rough to simulate the real SAPI. Plates will be extruded from impact resistant polyvinylchloride (PVC) and will contain no filler materials. Training plates made by this process and material will be highly robust and able to accommodate rough handling while providing excellent resistance to temperature and humidity fluctuation. Plates will be light in color, either beige, tan, or natural with color infused throughout the material.  Plates will not be painted or otherwise tinted. Visual characteristics should be present to aid in the identification of the plate as a training device only. This configuration will discourage co-mingling of training devices with functional SAPI.  <BR><BR>Item #2 - The insert kits will consist of three sections that replicate the ballistic panels within an Outer Tactical Vest.  The material must be resilient, match the approximate weight and feel of the original panels and provide air circulation to minimize Soldier discomfort during training.<BR>Panels will be manufactured as follows. <BR>Material:  Prime flexible polyvinyl chloride plastic, UL rated HB (horizontal burn, self-extinguishing), lead free, with ultraviolet weathering package.<BR>Durometer:  70 Shore A, 15 second delay. Standard. Durometer may be adjusted upward to meet customer requirements to match stiffness of Kevlar inserts<BR>Color:  Plastic standard colors<BR>Size:  Custom sizes upon request to match size, weight, stiffness, and form of OTV Kevlar inserts.<BR><BR>Training vest insert, while closely matching real ballistic panels to support effective Soldier training, will maintain a noticeable tactile distinction to aid in the identification of the vest as a training device only. This configuration will discourage co-mingling of training devices with functional OTVs.  <BR><BR><BR>   Delivery requirement is 4-6 weeks to Guard Material Management Center (GMMC) 5751 Briarhill Road, Lexington, KY 40516-9721.<BR>             <BR>     A sample of each item offered must be shipped to the following two locations by the response date of 09/22/2009:<BR> <BR>ARNG Readiness Center, Attn:  NGB-ARL-E (MAJ Cheek), 111 South George Mason Drive, Arlington, VA  22204-1382<BR><BR>NGB-GMMC Rear Storage Area, Attn: CW2 Henry, 5751 Briarhill Road, Bldg 6, Lexington, KY  40516-9721.<BR><BR>Samples must be received by 09/22/2009 to be considered for evaluation. <BR><BR>The following clauses apply to this solicitation:<BR>The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this solicitation.

<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-36.</p>
<p>(IV) This procurement is unrestricted and open to all sources. The associated NAICS code is 334519. The small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This is a combined solicitation/synopsis for purchase of the following commercial item:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 - Laser scanning coordinate measuring machine.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements:<br />Performance Requirements for 3-D laser Scanner<br />We are purchasing a 3-D laser scanner to make measurements on NIST<br />SRMs used for Charpy impact testing and a variety of other<br />mechanical test specimens that we use in our laboratory. The SRM<br />specimens are 10 X 10 X 55 mm, with a notch that is 2.000 &plusmn; 0.025 mm<br />deep, with a radius of 0.250 &plusmn; 0.025 mm. Other specimens have sizes in the 100 to 500 mm range. We will use the system to compare our machined parts to CAD requirements for the parts. We will also scan specimens following testing (deformed), and compare this scan data to the as-machined dimensions for the specimens. For this application, we will compare scan data from deformed specimens to 3-D data from models predicting the 3-D and 2-D deformation of the parts during testing. For these applications we require the state-of -the-art resolution, accuracy, and repeatability to give us full representation of the surfaces of our samples. We also require software that meets our needs. Since this is a laboratory setting, our software needs range from specific to very general, and we require an easily programmable system that can be customized to meet our measurement needs (for both scanning and for analysis).</p>
<p>Performance requirements are provided to help assure that we purchase a system with state of the art resolution, repeatability, accuracy, sample density, and well designed user- friendly software. The components of the system must all be part of an established product line. All components in the system shall be newest models and currently produced for distribution in the United States.</p>

While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of technical, past performance and price.  FAR 52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(I)	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT (II)	PAST PERFORMANCE (III)	PRICE  
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii),   the two non-price factors.  (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)  Offerors' proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, the Government will rate the products offered as either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.  
Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii).  Under this factor, the Government will rate past performance as either acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.    For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price.    
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   
(b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 
(c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has an acceptable record of past performance.  A proposal that receives a rating of acceptable on past performance is one that demonstrates little anticipated risk in the areas of quality of the product, timely delivery, and customer satisfaction.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies and subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement.   
Offers that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Thus, the Contracting Officer may determine it is an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 
(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/  .  All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements. FAX number is 805-982-2558.

<DESC>Amendment to solicitation F1B1R29180A001:  The following question and answers are provided:  Submital date has NOT been extended.

Q: In the Auditorium, where will the EMSEC secure briefing laptop connection need to be located. 
A: The EMSEC laptop connection should be placed in / around the podium.  We will have a podium that is movable, so if we need to put it in the stage or floor by where the podium would normally be that will work too.
  
Q: In the conference room, which wall will the Plasma Display be located.
A:  The display will go on the west wall, where the white board is now.
 
Q: Where will the equipment racks be located. (Keep in mind that all
equipment is RF and can be controlled without line of sight. The only time
the equipment will need to be accessed is to load a DVD or VHS)
A:  The equipment racks should be located in the corner of the room to the
right of the display.  This should be the northwest corner of the conference room and auditorium.

Q:  Are we responsible for 110 power in the ceiling for the projector in
the auditorium? 
A:  YES, CONTRACTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INSTALLING THIS POWER.

Q:  Could you be more specific about the Lutron lighting system in the
auditorium: what type?, how many?, part numbers?, will they integrate with
the touchpanel?, are we responsible for all 110 wiring?
A:  Vendor will be responsible for all 110 wiring One basic Lutron lighting system is required and needs to be integrated with the touch panel. This will allow OSS to control the lighting from one location. Do not have a specific part number, the vendor would chose the lighting system that integrates with all the other equipment.

A:  In the Conference room, which part number for the 65" plasma TV is
correct?  The new # on the FedBizOpps site is PAVTH65PZ750U - this one has
been discontinued.
A:  OSS DOES NOT CARE WHICH 65" PLASMA THEY USE.

Q:  Also in the Conference room, the part number for the speakers doesn't
appear to be valid - ATSP8C?  Are they to be Speco? JBL?  Do you have a
different part number?
A:  OSS DOES NOT CARE WHICH SPEAKERS THEY USE AS LONG AS THEY WORK WITH THE SYSTEM.

Q:  The Conference room has a white board on one wall that will need to be removed if that is where the projection screen will be.  
A:  Tthe screen will go where the white board is now and the white board will be removed.  

Submital date has NOT been extended.

<p>(b) Past Performance Surveys: The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Provide a list of no more than five (5), of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three years.

<p>2. Evaluation Factors for Award.</p>
<p>General Information</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia has visitor control procedures requiring individuals not affiliated with the installation to obtain a visitor pass prior to entrance. SOME DELAY SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED WHEN HAND-CARRYING PROPOSALS. Late proposals will be processed in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(f) "Late submission, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) PAST PERFORMANCE<br />(2) PRICE</p>
<p>Past Performance is significantly more important than Price when being evaluated.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) Addendum</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause 52.212-1, Instructions to offeror, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and past performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount for each. The offers will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness of the proposed evaluated price.</p>
<p>B. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on the references provided by the offeror and data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant past performance includes performance of efforts involving the performance of services described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating.</p>
<p>C. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall past performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined herein. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will/will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. When no performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, the rating will be "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>D. Performance Confidence Assessment Rating. Past performance will be used as a measure of the Government's confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform based on previous and current contracts and support agreements. Past performance information may be obtained through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), questionnaires provided by the offeror (see part 2 of Addendum to</p>
<p>52.212.-1 - Instructions to Offerors), through Defense Contract Management Command Channels, through interviews with program managers and contracting officers , or other sources known to the Government. Data from previous source selections or contractor capability assessments will be used if the data is recent and relevant. A confidence assessment rating will be assigned to each offeror as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE - No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned</p>
<p>E. Performance Evaluation - Relevancy Ratings. To assist the Government's evaluation, each offeror's supporting past performance will be evaluated for relevancy as follows:</p>
<p>VERY RELEVANT - Past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>RELEVANT - Past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>SOMEWHAT RELEVANT - Past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>NOT RELEVANT - Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>F. Past Performance Evaluation - Recency:<br />Only past performance being performed within the last three (3) years of proposal due date shall be considered for recency.</p>
<p>G. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>H. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating and is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>I. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a " Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>J. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to the other than lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a past performance risk rating of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>K. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors - Commercial Item. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>L. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSJUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONFAR 6.302-2, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)"REPLACEMENT OF SWITCHGEAR SUBSTATION 2"
.  
1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System shall enter into a contract that requires justification for other than full and open competition.
2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  The Department of Veterans Affairs is procuring the replacement of the high voltage switchgear at Substation 2 located at the south side of the V.A. West L.A. campus.  The contractor is the local utility provider, EDISON ESI which is a subsidiary of Southern California Edison. This switchgear supports the south side critical buildings 304 (Patient Care, Poly Trauma, and Research), 506 (District Counsel), 507 (Magnetic Resonance Image, PET, Research), and 345 (Neutron Treatment facility) a total quantity of 4 buildings (housing patients) and when tested and evaluated by KT Industries it was found to be in a near failure state due to poor insulation, and in danger due to a catastrophic short or an arc flash.   
The problems affecting the existing switchgear are degradation and low insulation resistance on the main disconnect and secondary breakers of the switchgear, with a potential of dead short causing the explosion of the existing switchgear, shutting down the electrical power for the above buildings 304 (Patient Care, Poly Trauma, and Research), 506 (District Counsel), 507 (Magnetic Resonance Image, PET, Research), and 345 (Neutron Treatment facility) on the south side of the West L.A. campus, and endangering the lives of V.A. electricians who maintain the switchgear equipment.  Also, accumulation and seepage of water and moisture has damaged the insulation of the supply high voltage cables underneath the switchgear. 
Failure of this switchgear would cause loss of power and the closure buildings 304 (Patient Care, Poly Trauma, and Research), 506 (District Counsel), 507 (Magnetic Resonance Image, PET, Research), and 345 (Neutron Treatment facility) on the south side of the West L.A. for several days if not weeks and would implicate installation of a temporary switchgear with an estimated additional cost of over $250,000, inhibiting the V.A. of providing patient care and protecting Government property. 
This procurement is an emergency order.  We recognize that SCE would be able to obtain one of the best completion time for this work because of their purchasing power and relationship with equipment manufacturers and distributors. This prompt action could potentially safeguard life and property.
3. Description of Requirement: VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System is requesting sole source service contract from Edison ESI, to provide a switchgear replacement. Southern Ca. Edison's electrical high voltage network is connected to this switchgear.  
The VA has identified a need for the procurement of electrical substation switchgear replacement services that provide electrical power to the buildings 304 (Patient Care, Poly Trauma, and Research), 506 (District Counsel), 507 (Magnetic Resonance Image, PET, Research), and 345 (Neutron Treatment facility) on the South side of the West L.A. V.A. Campus.  The problems affecting the existing switchgear are degradation and low insulation resistance on the main disconnect and secondary breakers of the switchgear.  
Replacement of the switchgear will prevent a possible insulation breakdown and a dead short, thereby shutting down electrical power to the buildings 304, 506, 507, and 345 of the West L.A. campus, posing a safety hazard to V.A. electricians, inhibiting the V.A. of providing patient care and protecting Government property. 
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The service being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. (c) (2), FAR Part 6.302-2(b), Unusual and compelling urgency. 
a. Part of the switchgear is SCE owned equipment, such as the metering, meter transformers, related equipment and main high voltage feeders.  This is the juncture where we receive high voltage electrical power from SCE and its metered for our consumption. This is one of the main reasons why we are requesting a sole source procurement with SCE under their subsidiary ESI because of common responsibility and liability for this overall equipment.
b. Edison ESI is knowledgeable of this facility's electrical systems, as the switchgear also houses Edison ESI's metering, monitoring equipment and is tied to the EDISON ESI substation. We recognize the high level of training and skills of the utility company staff to ensure a safe and timely installation that would help support our operations during the cut-off and switchover time during this equipment swap.  
c. EDISON ESI recognizes that an urgent need exists to perform the replacement of the switchgear at substation 2 as expeditiously as possible. The fabrication of this particular switchgear has a lead time of approximately 20 weeks because most components are not off-the-shelf components and are built upon demand.  We recognize that SCE would be able to obtain one of the best completion time for this work because of their purchasing power and relationship with equipment manufacturers and distributors. 
d. In case of catastrophic failure of the switchgear, buildings 304, 506, 507, and 345 would loose electricity, V.A. will have to contract with SCE by emergency, as SCE would have to repair their own high voltage feeder cabling and equipment provide a quick response and restore power to the entire north campus.  SCE has the expertise and the necessary back up electrical equipment back to restore the high voltage lines and switchgear.  The switchgear equipment poses danger to V.A. electrical personnel and other contractor personnel as it mail fail and explode.  Main disconnect is part of the switchgear.  SCE is be the only entity that can safely shut down the power from their network.  SCE will not allow V.A. or other contractor personnel to be within SCE vaults or tamper with their equipment.
e. The V.A. presently has a contract with Edison ESI to replace the switchgear at Building 299.  Since Edison ESI is already working on the Building 299 switchgear, they will have qualified electrical personnel on site in case of an emergency, explosion and break down of Substation 2. 5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: The V.A. has an immediate need for the procurement of replacement of the switchgear at Substation 2. The problems affecting the existing switchgear are degradation and low insulation resistance on the main disconnect and secondary breakers of the switchgear, with a potential of dead short causing the explosion of the existing switchgear, shutting down the electrical power for the buildings 304, 506, 507, and 345 south side of the West L.A. campus, and endangering the lives of V.A. electricians who maintain the switchgear equipment
6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  See number 5 above.  A notice will not be transmitted to the GPE (Fedbizzopps) because of the exception rule available under FAR 5.202(a) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency.   
7. Anticipated Cost: See government estimate.  The procurement of the new electrical switchgear at substation 2 and replacement cost is estimated to be under $550,000.00.
8. Results of Market Survey: Market research information was also obtained by surveying the market via internet sources and communication with other vendors.  See Items 5 above. 
9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Items 5 above.
10. Any Other Interested Sources.  See Item 5.  
11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: None. See Paragraph 2, 3, 4, and 5 above.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract in accordance to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), authorized or required by statue.  The Research Department at the Providence VA Medical Center requires the purchase of equipment for the measurement of arterial pulse wave velocity and wave reflection provided by the NIHem Dock Workstation.   Under statue 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Providence VA Medical Center intends to make a sole source award of this requirement to Cardiovascular Engineering.
The proposed contract action is for new equipment to perform research that requires very accurate and reproducible measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity as a measure of arterial compliance.  Although there are other vendors of such devices, the devices are intended for clinical studies and do not possess the same research applicability as the NIHem Dock Workstation.  The NIHem Dock Workstation possesses fidelity, reproducibility, and data storage capabilities meeting required specifications not found in comparison equipment.  The NIHem Dock Workstation has been used in numerous large scale research studies on pulse wave velocity and is a standard in the field.  Cardiovascular Engineering is the sole manufacturer with exclusive rights for this noninvasive hemodynamic data and analysis system required for conducting the research project at this facility.  Cardiovascular Engineering does not distribute this equipment to outside sources for resale.  The Government intends to award to only one source Cardiovascular Engineering under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation document is available.
