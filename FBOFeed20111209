This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br /></span></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of <strong>Cohesive Bandages on or about March 2012</strong>, but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements.
<p>Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to, cohesive bandages disposable, latex-free/safe, individually wrapped, sterile in sizes ranging from 3-6 inches x 5 yards and disposable, latex and latex-free/safe, non-sterile cohesive bandages in sizes ranging from 1-6 inches x 5 yards. The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $1,524,000 annually.</p>
<p>NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /><br /></span></strong>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website.</p>

The VA is soliciting for Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses with cascading procedures for award as described below. All documents will be available on or about December 13, 2011. Inquiries may be sent via e-mail to Crystal.Showell@va.gov.

Responders should identify if they are a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, or a small business or small disadvantaged business concern, based on this NAICS code.

METHOD OF AWARD - CASCADE PROCEDURE: Any award(s) resulting from this solicitation will be made using the following cascade order of precedence:

1. In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.14 and PL 109-461, award under this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis first to an eligible Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business (SDVOSB) concern (see Section K, FAR 52.219-1, "Small Business Program Representations" for small business size definition) who submits a responsive offer, provided that there is adequate competition among such firms.

2. If there is inadequate competition for award to a SDVOSB concern, award will be made competitively to an eligible Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) concern.

3. If there is inadequate competition for award to a VOSB concern, award will be made competitively to an 8a or HubZone small business concern.

4. If there is inadequate competition for award to an 8a or HubZone concern, award will be made competitively to a small business concern IAW FAR 19.5.

5. If there is inadequate competition for award to a small business concern, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all responsive offers submitted by responsible business concerns. 

Adequate competition shall be deemed to exist if-

At least two competitive offers are received from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration; and

Award will be made at fair market prices as determined in accordance with FAR 19.202-

6. When there is inadequate competition at any tier, an otherwise competitive offer from a responsible business concern at that tier will be considered with the eligible offers for the next lower tier.

All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The government will use the best value award decision. This process will permit the Government to make tradeoffs among price and non price factors which allows the Government to make award to other than the lowest priced proposal. However, price may become the deciding factor for award of the contract should the government determine that non-price factors between proposals are approximately equal. The following evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance apply:

3. Past Performance - The Performance Risk evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the proposed requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. In this context, "offeror" refers to the proposed prime contractor and all proposed major subcontractors. A major subcontractor is defined as one who will be providing critical services or whose subcontract is for more than 50% of the total proposed price. Follow the instructions for submitting the Past/Present Performance Reference Form for at least three (3) references using the guidance below: Technical and past performance when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.
The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy and recency of the offeror's past performance, as well as that of its major subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. Past performance will be evaluated to ensure satisfactory business practices and timely performance (provide no more than three (3) verifiable references with contact information. The Government will assess the demonstrated quality of performance on similar, relevant work, to include the ability to control the quality and cost of work and effectiveness at accomplishing the goals of previous similar relevant work.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division, Panama City, FL (NSWC PCD), intends to award a sole-source firm fixed price contract to the Lord Corporation, 111 Lord Drive, Cary NC 27511 for upgrade to a prototype Marine Rotor Active Balancing System (MRABS) currently installed on the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hull number 91 at NSWC PCD.  Upgrades required are to the starboard balancers with better-protected cables, adding balancers to the port side of the craft, upgrade the control system to manage transient inputs and coupling between different balancers and between port and starboard systems, replacing test-type electronics control rack currently installed in the starboard cabin with a more compact control system,  providing a new maintenance and  interface panel, and material upgrades to certain components to provide better corrosion resistance in the LCAC environment.
  This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The system to be upgraded was designed, manufactured, and installed by Lord Corporation.  This company, as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is the only source with the in-depth knowledge of the MRABS design required to modify and upgrade their own system.  This is particularly true of the proprietary control system and imbedded software.  Thus Lord Corporation is the only source that can perform this requirement. 

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.
  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Department of Defense will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  Registration may be accomplished by accessing the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov/.  NAICS 541330 applies.  Small Business Size standard $4.5M.  PSC K020.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Albuquerque, NM that will be expiring. The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), intends to compete its requirement for a second generation of Advanced Imaging Technology-2 (AIT-2). The AIT-2 system is used as a primary screening device to inspect a passenger's body for concealed weapons (metal and non-metal), explosives and other prohibited items. AIT takes into account passenger privacy considerations and employs safeguards to provide the maximum level of privacy protection to passengers. AIT is being upgraded to include Automated Target Recognition (ATR) capability which reduces privacy concerns and decreases passenger processing time. AIT-2 may also serve as a platform for potential integration of metal detection and/or shoe scanning capability. <br />
<p><br />The estimated release date for the solicitation is in the week of 17 January, 2012. The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on this same FedBizOps webpage, with the exception of certain RFP attachments which are considered either Sensitive Security Information (SSI) or Classified National Security Information (CNSI). In order to be approved to view these attachments upon RFP release, a contractor must meet the requirements and complete the steps listed below prior to 20 December 2011 at 3:00 PM Eastern.

<CONTACT>Pierre Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-295-3868, Fax 301-295-1716, Email pierre.smith@usuhs.mil
<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, Maryland, intends to negotiate a on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1 (b), with ASG Federal, Inc. for a full service, preventative maintenance contract for the following software:
<p>&bull;	ASG-Report.Web Archive<br />&bull;	ASG-Report.Web Enterprise Server<br />&bull;	ASG-Report.Web Guru<br />&bull;	ASG-Report.Web Insight<br />&bull;	ASG-Report.Web Modeler</p>
<p>This service will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures).  The period of performance for the required maintenance agreement commences on 1 November 2011 and ends 31 October 2012 with two (2) one year options.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on information that ASG Federal is the sole developer of the software currently in use, and thus the all updates and upgrades are proprietary to the vendor.  The manufacturer is the only company that has specialized and technical knowledge, as well as the necessary tools, manpower and repair parts to maintain this software in an operable state. Another vendor was not located that had the technical and specialized knowledge and/or accessibility to repair parts for this system. Therefore ASG Federal is the one source reasonably available to meet the needs of the government.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quote.  However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide updates and maintenance to the existing software currently in use. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 14 December 2011, 10:00 am EST.</p>

<RESPDATE>013112
<ARCHDATE>03012012
<CONTACT>JOANNE M. MURPHY
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN)Peer Reviews for BSEEs Research & Development (R&D) Program
1.0  Description
This Sources Sought Notice facilitates the identification of technically competent and independent (objective) experts to peer safety research funded by Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), Technology Assessment & Research (TA&R).
2.0  Purpose
The BSEE TA&R Program intends to create a pool of technically competent and independent experts so that they can be periodically contacted and invited to peer review safety research.  The BSEE TA&R is collecting information via this SSN in order to review submissions and invite qualified and independent experts into peer review panels evaluating the active research.  This SSN is seeking individuals within the North American system of academic institutions and other qualified individuals outside of academia as long as they are not employed by an oil and gas company operating on the OCS.
3.0  Background on the BSEE TA&R Safety R&D Program
The TA&R Program is a research element encompassed by the BSEE regulatory program. The TA&R Program supports research associated with operational safety and pollution prevention.  The TA&R Program was established in the 1970s to ensure that industry operations on the Outer Continental Shelf incorporated the use of the Best Available and Safest Technologies (BAST) subsequently required through the 1978 OCSLA amendments.
The TA&R Program has four primary objectives:
*Technical SupportProviding engineering support to the BSEE decision makers in evaluating industry operational proposals and ensuring that these proposals comply with applicable regulations, rules, and operational guidelines and standards.
*Technology AssessmentInvestigating and assessing industry applications of technological innovations and promoting the use of the BAST in BSEE regulations, rules and operational guidelines.
*Research CatalystProviding international cooperation for R&D initiatives to enhance the safety of offshore energy extraction activities and the development of appropriate regulatory program elements worldwide.
The TA&R Program operates through contracts with universities, private firms, and government laboratories to assess safety-related technologies and to perform necessary applied research.

4.0  What Types of Research Are Reviewed?
BSEE TA&R awards safety research that can be categorized as addressing one or more of four program objectives shown in the previous section.  They are short-term (1-3 years) and past proof of concept or deployment in nature.  Competitive research recipients have formed teams of partners who are necessary and critical in executing a research scope that brings the highest likelihood of deploying that research output to the desired end users.  These teams commonly contain engineering firms, academic institutions, technology vendors, and standards developing organizations such as the American Petroleum Institute (API). Identified end users are primarily BSEE.  In addition, other researchers, academic institutions and the general public have accessed program reporting for furthering safety. 
Research subject matter has covered virtually all engineering disciplines with a focus on petroleum, structural, mechanical, metallurgical and electrical engineering.  Additional information can be found at http://www.bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Technology-Assessment-and-Research.aspx on the types of safety research commonly funded by BSEE.
5.0  Background on Peer Reviews
Through the Information Quality Act1, Congress directed Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to "provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies."  A resulting OMB Bulletin entitled, "Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review" was issued prescribing required procedures for Federal programs.
Peer reviews are intended to uncover any technical problems or unsolved issues in a scientific work product through the use of technically competent and independent (objective) experts.  Peer review of a major scientific work product that will have the imprimatur of the Federal Government needs to be incorporated into the upfront planning of any action based in the work product.  This includes obtaining the proper resource commitments (reviewers and funds) then establishing realistic schedules.
6.0  Registering/Submitting:  General Information
The documents each applicant submits are reviewed to evaluate qualifications and register potential qualified panelists for future reviews.  A single panelist may or may not be invited to consecutive reviews since the OMB Bulletin requires that panels must periodically change panelist so that new experts keep panels balanced.  Participating panelists are considered individuals if they are representing themselves and not any academic institution.
Panelists are chosen on the basis of three criteria: expertise, balance, and independence.  They range from academics to active and or retired pipeline personnel from operators, regulators and standards developing organizations.  Technically qualified and cleared panelists may qualify for an honorarium commensurate with the time and effort dictated by the panelist expectations.
Each panelist will provide the Peer Review Coordinator a short circum vitae describing his/her work history and qualifications of technical knowledge.  This information (excluding address, phone or email) is incorporated into the peer review report and posted publicly.
7.0  Creating Circum Vitae
Interested individuals must create a short circum vitae for submission.  The document must have information within the following categories in Microsoft WORD or PDF format:
1.	Name2.	Mailing address, phone number and email3.	Education4.	Professional Experience5.	Certifications (if any)6.	Professional Memberships
8.0  Information Confidentiality
Interested individuals who submit a circum vitae must agree to have the BSEE develop and maintain a list of contacts organized in terms of technical expertise.  This information will be maintained in strict accordance with Federal statues and regulations governing privacy protections.  Individuals on this list can be contacted for employment directly in the peer review process of other BSEE.
For the BSEE reviews, the circum vitae information (excluding address, phone or email) is incorporated into the peer review report and posted publicly.  
9.0  Submitting a Circum Vitae
A completed circum vitae with the required information shown in section 7.0 of this announcement must be emailed to Joanne Murphy by 3:00 PM EST on Monday, January 31, 2012.  Please insert "SSN: BSEE Peer Reviews" into the subject line and attach the requested information in a short email to joanne.murphy@bsee.gov.
10.0  Submission Feedback
A representative from BSEE will contact all submitters and convey one or more of the following items after reviewing an individuals circum vitae:
1.	You did not qualify and were not added to the pool of potential peer review panelists.2.	You were added to the pool of panelist but not selected for the current year peer reviews.3.	Your contact information will be retained for future peer review and you may be contacted with an invitation into a future peer review.4.	You were added to the pool of panelist and will be contacted as requirements occur by a designated BSEE representative.

<DESC>The Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) Project Office at NASA GoddardSpace Flight Center (GSFC) hereby requests information to identify potential sources fora space flight qualified multi-rate Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) opticalcommunications modem. The multi-rate modem modulates an optical signal for transmissionof input electrical data and demodulates a second received optical signal into outputelectrical data.  Among the requirements for the DPSK optical communications modems are the modulation,waveforms and physical layer framing used on the optical signals needs to be designed toenable high-sensitivity, widely-adjustable-data-rate, and bi-directional opticalcommunication over a fading free-space communication channel.  Modem interfaces need toinclude electrical power (+28 VDC provided by a host), high-speed electrical interfacesfor user data that will be connected to a switching backplane capable of forwarding userdata between two space terminals.  The Controller Electronics (CE) is implemented withlow-rate electrical interfaces for telemetry and control data.	The Optical Module (OM)optical interfaces consist of a polarization-maintaining transmitter optical fiber andsingle-mode receiver optical fiber. In the current system architecture, no encoding or decoding of the data is performedwithin space terminals DPSK modem.  Instead, the payload must be encoded/decoded andframed at the point of origin and termination by the ground terminals DPSK modem.  Thisedge-to-edge coding architecture will enable high-rate links and robust performance viapowerful modern forward error correction coding that can be upgraded if futurescalability is required.Therefore the LCRD Project Office is interested in two versions of a space qualified DPSKoptical communications modem.  (1)	A modem that supports 2.5 Gbps and lower rates with no forward error correctingcode required.(2)	A modem that supports 10 Gbps and lower rates with no forward error correctingcode requiredIn addition LCRD Project Office is interested in two versions of a ground DPSK opticalcommunications modem (space qualification is not required):(1)	A modem that supports 2.5 Gbps and lower rates with a rate  forward errorcorrecting code for a user rate of 1.25 Gbps and below.(2)	A modem that supports 10 Gbps and lower rates with a rate  forward errorcorrecting code for a user rate of 5 Gbps.The LCRD Project Office is interested in pursuing either a 2.5 Gbps or 10 Gbps uncodedDPSK modem for the flight terminal and a 2.5 Gbps or 10 Gbps  rate coded DPSK modem forthe ground terminal. The final decision on maximum data rate will not be made until justbefore LCRDs Mission Concept Review which is scheduled for June 2012.Each of the two optical communications terminals in space needs a multi-rate DPSK modem. The space modems need to support a minimum of a two year mission life in GEO orbit. Also, each of the two ground stations needs a similar modem. The LCRD Project Officewould like information on the development cost, development schedule, mass, volume, andpower requirements of both the flight and ground DPSK modems. The Project Office is alsointerested in a Technology Readiness Level breakdown of the technologies in the modem anda plan to space qualify the flight modem if it isnt already space qualified.  The complete statement of work for the DPSK Optical Communications Modem is herebyprovided as a point of reference.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites forthe release of any synopsis or solicitation.Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet theabove requirement should submit a capability statement of ten (10) pages or lessindicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.Responses to this RFI must include the following: name and address of firm, size ofbusiness, average annual revenue for past three (3) years and number of employees;ownership; business size standard, such as, large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a),HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SD-VOSB), Veteran Owned SmallBusiness (VOSB) and/or Women-Owned; number of years in business; affiliate information;parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (ifpotential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering thepast five (5) years (highlight the relevant work performed, contract numbers, contracttype, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact  address and phone number).This RFI is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as acommitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information requested.Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.

<DESC><br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified small business sources. This includes small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) businesses; small disadvantaged businesses; and Women-owned small businesses based on the size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. This requirement is assigned a code of 541611 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the size standard for such requirements is $7M. <br />An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is suitable. <br />Background: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)/NIH, serves as the Acquisition Services Branch for the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD). The mission of the NIMHD is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and eliminate health disparities. The NIMHD Research Endowment Program is a unique congressionally mandated initiative that promotes minority health and health disparities research capacity building at eligible academic institutions by investing in the education and training of underrepresented minorities and socio-economically disadvantaged individuals. The NIMHD Research Endowment Program makes that investment by awarding grants to an institution's endowment. The interest generated by this investment must be used to:<br />&bull; Strengthen the research infrastructure through the renovation of facilities, purchase of state-of-the-art instruments and equipment, and enhance information technology; <br />&bull; Enhance the academic environment by recruiting a diverse faculty and creating challenging courses in such topics as research methodology and health disparities as additions to the curriculum; and <br />&bull; Enhance the recruitment and retention of racial and ethnic minority and socio-economically disadvantaged students that are underrepresented in the scientific workforce. <br />Eligible institutions include only those currently funded under the Health Resources and Services Administration Centers of Excellence Program (Section 736 of the PHS Act) or the NIMHD Centers of Excellence Program (Section 464z-4 of the PHS Act).<br />NIMHD plans to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for public comment on proposed Research Endowment Program regulations. The proposed regulations specify the Endowment Program application procedures, eligibility, how grants will be awarded, how grants may be used, reporting requirements for recipient organizations, and penalties for misuse of grant funds. This Statement of Work covers only the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) portion of the NPRM. Therefore, NICHD seeks capability statements from interested and qualified potential sources to perform a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The work will include both a draft and final RIA. According to Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, the RIA should include analysis of the potential impacts of the rule upon state, tribal, and local governments, small businesses, and other small entities as required by E.O. 12866, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act.
<p>Capability Statement: To be deemed capable, respondents must demonstrate a background in Economics with training in regulatory impact assessments and a minimum of 3-5 years experience preparing RIAs for the Federal Government in compliance with relevant statutory requirements and OMB Guidance, specifically experience in performing economic cost-benefit analysis. Experience with grants or health related regulations are desired but not required.</p>
<p>Respondents must include the DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of small business (e.g. 8(a), HUBZone, etc) pursuant to NAICS code 541611.</p>
<p>Interested organizations that consider possessing the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit electronic copies to belangern@mail.nih.gov by 3:00 PM EST on December 19, 2011 . Hard copies can be submitted to Nicole Belanger, Contracting Officer, NICHD Acquisition Services Branch, 6100 Executive Blvd, Suite 5Z00, MSC 7510, Bethesda, MD 20892-7510.</p>
<p>Respondents using a delivery service (i.e. Fed Ex or UPS) or hand-carried must be sent to Nicole Belanger, Contracting Officer, NICHD Acquisition Services Branch, 6100 Executive Blvd, Suite 5Z00, Rockville, MD 20852.</p>
<p>Please limit responses to fifteen (15) pages or less, excluding resumes/curriculum vitae. Any proprietary information should be so marked.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in the response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate.</p>

<DESC>Department of State 2012 Design-Build Contract for <br />US Embassy Jakarta, Indonesia<br />RFP SAQMMA-12-R0061<br />Notice of Solicitation of Submissions for Contractor Pre-Qualification<br /><br />THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is requesting submissions to pre-qualify firms for Design-Build (D/B) services for the design and construction of a New Embassy Compound (NEC) in Jakarta, Indonesia. This project will be executed under OBO's Design Excellence Program (http://www.state.gov/obo/designexcellence/). The project will consist of the design and construction of a compound to house U.S. Diplomatic functions. The project is described below.
<p><br />1. Project Description (Secret Facility and Personnel Security Clearances Required)</p>
<p>SAQMMA-12-R0061, Jakarta, Indonesia NEC <br />The project will consist of design and construction services including a New Office Building (NOB) with attached Marine Security Guard Quarters (MSGQ), maintenance and support facilities, perimeter security, parking structures, vehicle and pedestrian access control facilities, site improvements, utilities and infrastructure. Approximate site area: 34,500sm; New Office Building/Marine Security Guard Quarters area: approx. 32,150sm; Support Annex (SPX) area: approx. 1,650sm; Parking structure area: approx. 13,450sm; Other Buildings combined approximate size: 3110 sm. Estimated design-build cost: $320 - $375 million.</p>
<p>The constructed compound will demonstrate an elevated standard of design quality for diplomatic facilities in its architecture, engineering, and construction. OBO requires that the completed compound be sustainable with high-performance facilities. The design requirements documents, which will be provided by OBO in the Project Solicitation Phase II, are an example of OBO's commitment to Design Excellence.</p>
<p>The Jakarta NEC project will be executed sequentially in two (2) stages of construction. Stage 1 construction includes foundations, site improvements, major compound utility infrastructure, high-rise construction, curtain wall and other exterior finishes, interior finishes, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and communications systems, photo-voltaic systems, rain and condensate-water harvesting, open-air canopies, and landscaping. Both project stages will include security systems, furniture, fixtures, signage, and commissioning of compound buildings and systems to function as a single facility at the end of each stage.</p>
<p>Stage 2 construction includes general demolition of vacated buildings at the west end of the compound following Stage 1 move in, re-construction of an historic building as an open air pavilion, new low-rise construction, exterior consular waiting area, open-air canopies, recreation facilities, and completion of perimeter security and site improvements for the remaining portion of the Embassy compound. The reconstruction of the historic building will consist primarily of new construction, but will incorporate salvaged materials and architectural elements from the original building. Utilities serving the existing Embassy facilities at the west end of the compound during Stage 1 construction will be completely removed during Stage 2, since all new buildings and utilities constructed during Stage 2 will be connected to the new utility infrastructure constructed in Stage 1.</p>
<p>OBO will provide a separate notice to proceed with construction of Stage 2 facilities after the new Stage 1 facilities have been accepted and occupied.</p>

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

Sources Sought

Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
Health Informatics Initiative
Nursing Education & Training Workshops

1.	INTRODUCTION:
This Sources Sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.  Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for the Office of Informatics & Analytics (OIA).  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.

2.	BACKGROUND:
According to the American Nursing Association "Nursing informatics (NI) is a specialty that integrates nursing science, computer science, and information science to manage and communicate data, information, knowledge, and wisdom in nursing practice. NI support patients, nurses and other providers in their decision-making in all roles and settings The goal of NI is to improve the health of populations, communities, families, and individuals by optimizing information management and communication. These activities include the design and use of information solutions and technology to support all areas of nursing, including, but not limited to, the direct provision of care, establishing effective administrative systems, designing useful decision support systems, managing and delivering educational experiences, enhancing lifelong learning, and supporting nursing research." Nursing Informatics: Scope and Standards of Practice (2008). 

The rapidly changing health care delivery system is creating a pressing need for nurses with advanced knowledge and skills to provide leadership for reshaping nursing and health care in communities and health care organizations. The informatics nurse serves as a translator between nurse clinicians and computer services personnel (program analysts, programmers, data base managers, hardware/software vendor and others). 

Over the past thirty years, the field of nursing informatics has evolved. Within this evolution, roles and responsibilities for nursing experts have subsequently evolved as well. The VA has arguably the largest population of NI in the world. What is interesting to note is the diverse way that NI become educated as experts. From on the job training to self directed learning through to graduate school study, the means to become educated in NI is still evolving. The diversity of NI roles in the VA illustrates this emerging discipline. Nurses serve in the roles of NI Specialists, Directors of Informatics, Informatics Project Managers, Analysts, Quality Improvement Specialists, Terminologists, Clinical Application Coordinators to name a few.  Currently there is a lack of consistent educational offerings and staff development opportunities for these nurses. 
One of the VA's Transformational Initiatives, the Health Informatics Initiative (HII) is poised to move the VA into new paradigms of practice. The purpose of the HII is to deliver reshape the future of VHA clinical information systems through deliberate application of health information technology (HIT). The HII strives to deliver solutions that transform health care delivery by improving quality and accessibility while optimizing value and to ensure that VA continues to be an industry leader in the use of HIT and health informatics.  VA's most valuable assets have always been its people.  A critical component of the HII is building health informatics capacity in the VA with a focus on developing informatics competencies, communities and careers. This course provides foundational knowledge of informatics theory and practice. 

Benefits to the VA:
1.	Supports the intent of the VA Strategic Health Informatics Initiative (HII) to develop informatics capacity in the VA (competency building and career development). 
2.	Develops knowledge and skills that can be used to improve workflow efficiencies, care processes and information management.
3.	Provides a forum for exchange of informatics best practices and networking among nurse participants.
4.	Provides an opportunity to prepare for professional certification supporting the Office of Nursing Services "Let's Get Certified" campaign.
5.	Promotes a culture of lifelong learning and value for education. 
6.	Responds to nursing requests for focused educational offerings based on needs assessments and focused interviews.
7.	Supports nursing informatics educational offerings in absence of other VA endorsed venues (e.g. VeHU).
8.	Conveys value for nursing informatics to the nursing community at large.
9.	Contributes to improvements in RN Satisfaction scores (retention tool).
10.	Provides 16 ANCC approved nursing contact hours for each participant.
11.	Assists in the development of informatics communities not bound by geographic or functional boundaries (community development). 
12.	Demonstrates to the community at large the VA commitment to support informatics professionals (recruitment tool).

3.	OBJECTIVES:
The Department of Veterans Affairs OIA office is seeking services for nursing education and training workshops.  The nursing informatics workshops provide an educational offering focused on fundamental, core nursing informatics principles and practice. Focus is on trends and issues in practice facing the nursing professional including the impact of human factors, systems analysis and design approaches. Other content includes methods for managing information databases and systems, as well as the evaluation of computer technology systems. The content provides an opportunity for the RN participant to prepare for the American Nursing Credentialing Center Nursing Informatics Certification Exam. The workshops will be held during week days to accommodate VA staffing needs.  Resources/class materials should include textbook, reference texts, and follow-on information sharing such as a magazine subscription.  

4.	SUBMITTAL INFORMATION:

<SUBJECT>--Peer Reviews for BSEEs Research & Development (R&D) Program
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>JOANNE M. MURPHY
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN)Peer Reviews for BSEEs Research & Development (R&D) Program
1.0  Description
This Sources Sought Notice facilitates the identification of technically competent and independent (objective) experts to peer safety research funded by Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), Technology Assessment & Research (TA&R).
2.0  Purpose
The BSEE TA&R Program intends to create a pool of technically competent and independent experts so that they can be periodically contacted and invited to peer review safety research.  The BSEE TA&R is collecting information via this SSN in order to review submissions and invite qualified and independent experts into peer review panels evaluating the active research.  This SSN is seeking individuals within the North American system of academic institutions and other qualified individuals outside of academia as long as they are not employed by an oil and gas company operating on the OCS.
3.0  Background on the BSEE TA&R Safety R&D Program
The TA&R Program is a research element encompassed by the BSEE regulatory program. The TA&R Program supports research associated with operational safety and pollution prevention.  The TA&R Program was established in the 1970s to ensure that industry operations on the Outer Continental Shelf incorporated the use of the Best Available and Safest Technologies (BAST) subsequently required through the 1978 OCSLA amendments.
The TA&R Program has four primary objectives:
*Technical SupportProviding engineering support to the BSEE decision makers in evaluating industry operational proposals and ensuring that these proposals comply with applicable regulations, rules, and operational guidelines and standards.
*Technology AssessmentInvestigating and assessing industry applications of technological innovations and promoting the use of the BAST in BSEE regulations, rules and operational guidelines.
*Research CatalystProviding international cooperation for R&D initiatives to enhance the safety of offshore energy extraction activities and the development of appropriate regulatory program elements worldwide.
The TA&R Program operates through contracts with universities, private firms, and government laboratories to assess safety-related technologies and to perform necessary applied research.

4.0  What Types of Research Are Reviewed?
BSEE TA&R awards safety research that can be categorized as addressing one or more of four program objectives shown in the previous section.  They are short-term (1-3 years) and past proof of concept or deployment in nature.  Competitive research recipients have formed teams of partners who are necessary and critical in executing a research scope that brings the highest likelihood of deploying that research output to the desired end users.  These teams commonly contain engineering firms, academic institutions, technology vendors, and standards developing organizations such as the American Petroleum Institute (API). Identified end users are primarily BSEE.  In addition, other researchers, academic institutions and the general public have accessed program reporting for furthering safety. 
Research subject matter has covered virtually all engineering disciplines with a focus on petroleum, structural, mechanical, metallurgical and electrical engineering.  Additional information can be found at http://www.bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Technology-Assessment-and-Research.aspx on the types of safety research commonly funded by BSEE.
5.0  Background on Peer Reviews
Through the Information Quality Act1, Congress directed Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to "provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies."  A resulting OMB Bulletin entitled, "Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review" was issued prescribing required procedures for Federal programs.
Peer reviews are intended to uncover any technical problems or unsolved issues in a scientific work product through the use of technically competent and independent (objective) experts.  Peer review of a major scientific work product that will have the imprimatur of the Federal Government needs to be incorporated into the upfront planning of any action based in the work product.  This includes obtaining the proper resource commitments (reviewers and funds) then establishing realistic schedules.
6.0  Registering/Submitting:  General Information
The documents each applicant submits are reviewed to evaluate qualifications and register potential qualified panelists for future reviews.  A single panelist may or may not be invited to consecutive reviews since the OMB Bulletin requires that panels must periodically change panelist so that new experts keep panels balanced.  Participating panelists are considered individuals if they are representing themselves and not any academic institution.
Panelists are chosen on the basis of three criteria: expertise, balance, and independence.  They range from academics to active and or retired pipeline personnel from operators, regulators and standards developing organizations.  Technically qualified and cleared panelists may qualify for an honorarium commensurate with the time and effort dictated by the panelist expectations.
Each panelist will provide the Peer Review Coordinator a short circum vitae describing his/her work history and qualifications of technical knowledge.  This information (excluding address, phone or email) is incorporated into the peer review report and posted publicly.

<SUBJECT>A--Peer Reviews for BSEEs Research & Development (R&D) Program
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>JOANNE M. MURPHY
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN)Peer Reviews for BSEEs Research & Development (R&D) Program
1.0  Description
This Sources Sought Notice facilitates the identification of technically competent and independent (objective) experts to peer safety research funded by Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), Technology Assessment & Research (TA&R).
2.0  Purpose
The BSEE TA&R Program intends to create a pool of technically competent and independent experts so that they can be periodically contacted and invited to peer review safety research.  The BSEE TA&R is collecting information via this SSN in order to review submissions and invite qualified and independent experts into peer review panels evaluating the active research.  This SSN is seeking individuals within the North American system of academic institutions and other qualified individuals outside of academia as long as they are not employed by an oil and gas company operating on the OCS.
3.0  Background on the BSEE TA&R Safety R&D Program
The TA&R Program is a research element encompassed by the BSEE regulatory program. The TA&R Program supports research associated with operational safety and pollution prevention.  The TA&R Program was established in the 1970s to ensure that industry operations on the Outer Continental Shelf incorporated the use of the Best Available and Safest Technologies (BAST) subsequently required through the 1978 OCSLA amendments.
The TA&R Program has four primary objectives:
*Technical SupportProviding engineering support to the BSEE decision makers in evaluating industry operational proposals and ensuring that these proposals comply with applicable regulations, rules, and operational guidelines and standards.
*Technology AssessmentInvestigating and assessing industry applications of technological innovations and promoting the use of the BAST in BSEE regulations, rules and operational guidelines.
*Research CatalystProviding international cooperation for R&D initiatives to enhance the safety of offshore energy extraction activities and the development of appropriate regulatory program elements worldwide.
The TA&R Program operates through contracts with universities, private firms, and government laboratories to assess safety-related technologies and to perform necessary applied research.

4.0  What Types of Research Are Reviewed?
BSEE TA&R awards safety research that can be categorized as addressing one or more of four program objectives shown in the previous section.  They are short-term (1-3 years) and past proof of concept or deployment in nature.  Competitive research recipients have formed teams of partners who are necessary and critical in executing a research scope that brings the highest likelihood of deploying that research output to the desired end users.  These teams commonly contain engineering firms, academic institutions, technology vendors, and standards developing organizations such as the American Petroleum Institute (API). Identified end users are primarily BSEE.  In addition, other researchers, academic institutions and the general public have accessed program reporting for furthering safety. 
Research subject matter has covered virtually all engineering disciplines with a focus on petroleum, structural, mechanical, metallurgical and electrical engineering.  Additional information can be found at http://www.bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Technology-Assessment-and-Research.aspx on the types of safety research commonly funded by BSEE.
5.0  Background on Peer Reviews
Through the Information Quality Act1, Congress directed Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to "provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies."  A resulting OMB Bulletin entitled, "Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review" was issued prescribing required procedures for Federal programs.
Peer reviews are intended to uncover any technical problems or unsolved issues in a scientific work product through the use of technically competent and independent (objective) experts.  Peer review of a major scientific work product that will have the imprimatur of the Federal Government needs to be incorporated into the upfront planning of any action based in the work product.  This includes obtaining the proper resource commitments (reviewers and funds) then establishing realistic schedules.

<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) intends to award an Order to GitHub Inc. on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for GitHub Enterprise Software.
<p>Github Enterprise is the enterprise version of Github.com, a web service that allows software developers to track changes in software code, manage issues, and collaborate among developer teams. Github is based on Git, a framework for managing software source code. Git has become the industry standard source code management platform for software development teams, supplanting older tools like Subversion, CSV, and SourceSafe, which have been obviated by the creation of Git. Moreover, Git is what is known as a "distributed" revision control system, meaning it was built with whole teams in mind, as opposed to its older counterparts, whose centralized nature creates inconvenience and risk for multi-member teams. In an organization where many developers and designers contribute to many ongoing software projects, a distributed solution is essential.</p>
<p>Github is the industry standard product for software development teams seeking to implement a Git-based environment. It includes a full set of software project management features including issue tracking, issue assignment, documentation, and virtual line-by-line code review and discussion. CFPB requires this feature set in a product that can be hosted inside an organization's firewall, and can be provisioned as a virtual appliance that gives developers easy administrative access to the solution's background engines. While several products can either be hosted internally or can provide this rich feature set, no other product provides both.</p>
<p>Since the launch of CFPB, the Technology &amp; Innovation (TI) team has been using Git to manage its source code. CFPB has been recruiting software developer talent from the technology sector, where Github is far and away the most popular source code management tool. It is the intent of the CFPB TI Team to continue to use Github Enterprise to manage its software development process. Switching to another source code management framework would be risky and regressive and would be detrimental to the team's ability to develop and maintain software code. Accordingly, the CFPB intends to sole source this requirement for the purchase of up to 40 user licenses.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by December 15, 2011 by 12:00am ET. Responses shall be submitted to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, Attention B. Cooper/L. Stanley.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. Responses to this request can be emailed to psb3@pbd.treas.gov - Attention: Brian Cooper/Lisa Stanley.</p>

<DESC><p>This notice announces a U.S. Immigration and Customs (ICE) Industry Day to be held on December 1, 2011 at the Dallas Field Office located at: 8101 North Stemmons FWY, Dallas, Texas 75247. The Industry Day will be held on the second floor of the building starting at 12:30 pm and will last until approximately 4:30 pm.</p>
<p>All business sizes are welcome to participate; however, ICE is trying to determine small business interest. All information received in response to this notice will be used to determine the appropriateness of any small business set-aside for this requirement.</p>
<p>Requirement: Transportation</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a continuing need for transportation services to provide, operate, and manage the transportation of detainees in ICE custody for the Dallas Field Office Area of Responsibility (AOR).</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561612.</p>
<p>Due to ICE requirements for flexibility in using Contractor personnel to conduct transportation as well as to support custody and escort operations, ICE has chosen to utilize the title of "Detention Officer" (DO) to refer to Contractor driver/armed guard personnel. This position reflects those responsibilities unrelated to transportation but which are required for the Contractor to effectively support the ICE mission.</p>
<p>DO duties include but are not limited to armed transportation services, escorting detainees to and from transport vehicles, monitoring detainees in custody, and conducting limited pat-downs.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish these services including management staff, supervision, manpower, relief officers, uniforms, equipment and supplies (including transport vehicles, firearms, body restraints, non-lethal devices, body armor, cellular telephones and radios) to provide transportation services for the most part during the week days. Staff shall be available twenty-four (24) hours a day to ensure the routes in ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Dallas are performed at the appropriate frequency. The Contractor shall assign at a minimum per vehicle, two person teams of armed DOs and provide a minimum of one (1) DO of the same gender of the detainee(s) being transported.</p>
<p>Contractor DOs shall not be tied to specific routes within the contract. DOs may be used to provide transportation and guard services as needed as consistent with the job description above. However, DOs will have to have specific locations as their home-base which will determine their prevailing wage determination.</p>
<p>The estimated number of detainees to be transported may vary day to day. It will be the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that the detainees are transported in the most safe and economical manner.</p>
<p>An advanced list of routes and frequencies will be provided to those attending the Industry Day. If you are not able to attend, the routes and frequencies will be provided in the RFP. The current estimate is that there are 131 routes in the Dallas AOR listed as daily (28), 1 to 3 times a week (58) and as needed (45). Based on the estimated number of detainees per trip, it will be up to the Contractor to provide the appropriate transport vehicle (bus, van, and/or sedan).</p>
<p>Required Permits and Licenses</p>
<p>Business Permits and Licenses</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor is responsible to obtain all business permits and licenses prior to performance of the contract.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall (depending on the state's requirements) be licensed as a quality security company in accordance with the requirements of the District, Municipality, County and State in which the ICE work site(s) is/are located.<br />&bull; Throughout the term of this contract, the Contractor shall maintain currency of ALL permits/business licenses and make them available for government inspection. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws and all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards.<br />- Firearms Requirements<br />- Body Armor Requirements</p>

If applicable, Contractor staff shall posses a current license/registration for the state(s) in which they are performing.</p>
<p>Standards and Policies</p>
<p>ICE requires that the Contractor comply with all required Standards and Policies. These include but are not limited to:<br />&bull; American Correctional Association (ACA) Standards for Adult Detention Facilities (most current edition) and the most recent copy of the supplement issued every two years. A copy is attainable through the following website: www.aca.org/bookstore/view.asp. <br />&bull; The DHS / ICE 2008 Performance Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) - A copy is attainable through the following website: http://www.ice.gov/detention-standards/2008/. <br />&bull; All rules and regulations governing public buildings and grounds.</p>
<p>Personnel Requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Background Investigations and Suitability Screenings will be conducted on all Contract Employees by the Office of Professional Responsibility and Personnel Security Unit (OPR-PSU).<br />&bull; The Contractor shall agree that each employee working on this contract will successfully pass the DHS Employment Eligibility Verification (E-Verify) program operated by USCIS to establish work authorization and U.S. Citizenship.<br />&bull; Employees must reside in the United States.</p>

<SUBJECT>--Intent to Sole Source to Ion Science (Americas) for Photo-Ionization Detectors

<a href="mailto:Fisher.Trina@epa.gov">Fisher, Trina</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Ion Science (Americas) LLC for purchase of Photo-Ionization Detectors.
Scope and Capabilities: The objective is to purchase two fully-enabled PhoCheck Tiger photo-ionization detectors (PIDs), two fully-enabled PhoCheck Tiger Select photo-ionization detectors, four CGA 600 Gas Regulators and Draeger tubes for the Tiger Select. The required PIDs are specific to and compatible with EPA?s investigative procedures for air toxics compliance inspections and must meet the following critical performance criteria: 1) Internal data logger clock accurate to 3 sec/day; 2) Rapid Response Time (Zero to full scale); 3) Reads 0 ppb to 20,000 ppm. Specifically, the internal data logger clock must be accurate to within 3 seconds during the course of the day because organic gas concentration measurements are averaged during each 15-second time period. In order to compare the Inspectors field notes with the logged data, the PID logger time-stamp must be reasonably close to the actually time. The response time of the PID is important because the instrumental response  to changes in gas concentration values must occur rapidly enough for the Inspector to make valid measurements in a reasonable amount of time during the course of taking field measurements. Lastly, EPA Inspectors must be able to determine the concentrations of gaseous leaks above 10,000 ppm for purposes of monitoring in accordance with EPA Method 21.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Ion Science is the sole vendor that meets all of the specifications required for the PIDs as listed above. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Trina Fisher via email to Fisher.Trina@epa.gov no later than 4:00 pm EST 10 calendar days after the date of this announcement. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>--Intent to Sole Source to Interpark Holdings for Parking Spaces
<SOLNBR>

<a href="mailto:fisher.trina@epa.gov">Trina Fisher</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Interpark Holdings Incorporated for (8) covered parking spaces from 1/1/12 to 12/31/12, with three one-year option periods.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Due to the job description of the EPA's criminal agents, they require close and ready access to their government vehicles. Covered parking is also required due to law enforcement vehicles having expensive law enforcement equipment installed. Having the vehicles out of sign helps to reduce any breaking and entering which can cause extensive damage to the vehicle as well as the equipment. As such, all parking lot accommodations for the Criminal Investigation Division must be located within close proximity (2 blocks or closer) of US EPA CID office space. OCEFT-CID Facility Standards also states: "Secure parking spaces are required for government owned or leased law enforcement vehicles. Access to the parking area is required at all times (24 hours per day). If parking cannot be provided on-site, it should be located within a two block radius of the office. Preference will be given to secured, covered, on-site parking."
Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Trina Fisher via email to fisher.trina@epa.gov no later than December 19, 2011 at 4:00 PM EST. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to award a purchase order to Comprehensive Volcanic Petrographics LLC for gathering, summarizing, and compiling existing historical lithologic records from the Nevada Test Site (NTS) and Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) in various forms and formats for inclusion into the USGS online thin-section image library.
Comprehensive Volcanic Petrographics, LLC led by Richard G. Warren is the only known qualified and responsible source to provide these services. His publication record demonstrates expertise in petrographic analysis and his online database and sample collection demonstrate a unique dedication to preserve petrographic information and samples produced for weapons testing.  He supported the Weapons Testing and UGTA projects as a petrographer/geochemist/geologist at LANL from 1980 to 2003.   Mr. Warren authored an online Petrographic, Geochemical, and Geophysical (PGG) database (Warren, et al., 2003, see citation above for URL) to provide geologic information considered most important for support of weapons testing.   Lithologic records exist in a variety of formats, including petrographic index cards, recipe cards, and field notes.   His experience and background is unique and will provide additional insight with respect to the proofing of records developed by others which are to be compiled into the required electronic format necessary to be input into the database.  In addition, a segment of the records to be compiled were those originated by Mr. Warren in earlier years, so he is best able to interpret those.  Alone among active petrographers greatly experienced in analysis of thin sections from the NNSS, Richard Warren of Comprehensive Volcanic Petrographics LLC publication record demonstrates collaboration with many early workers of the NNSS, which adds a unique historical perspective to aid in interpreting lithologies  associated  with thin sections contained in the USGS collection. No other sources are known which possess the background, experience, and knowledge of the existing handwritten lithologic records and data sets required specific to the NNSS required for this contract work.  
Duration of purchase order: Date of Award through 12/1/2014, with final delivery 12/01/2014.  No solicitation documents will be issued. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency.  NAICS: 541330.  Anticipated award date:  On or about December 23, 2011.  Point of Contact:  D.

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY SECTION

GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
a.	A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
b.	All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
c.	Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d.	Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
e.	The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractors employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
a.	Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
b.	VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractors information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VAs information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VAs sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
c.	Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Central Sterile Room (CSR) Packaging Supplies. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda Naval Hospital, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgery Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA a vendor must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR) , i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is May 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br /><strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270. Mrs. Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, sarah.l.allen@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3287. </strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Central Sterile Room (CSR) Packaging Supplies. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $870,062.82. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period.

A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation will be conducted using the below listed requirements with responses as either a "YES" (meets/passes requirements) or "NO" (does not/fails to meet requirements) answers. The MMESO JPRB has established that the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization will be eighty percent (80%) of the requirements questions answered as "YES" (meets/passes requirements). A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO South and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately nine MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (Durable Package Integrity - Joint Commission NPSG 07.05.01 - Reduce the risk of Surgical Site Infections). The CSR Pouch resists punctures, tears and abrasions. The CSR Packaging Supplies must be strong, flexible and remain intact throughout the sterilization process for sterility of the package to be maintained.<br />2. (Permeability/penetrability - Joint Commission NPSG 07.05.01 - Reduce the risk of Surgical Site Infections). The CSR Pouch allows for the effective penetration of sterilants (steam, ethylene oxide, plasmas, irradiation, ozone and moisture). Barrier must effectively allow penetration to provide sterility.<br />3. (Aeration - Joint Commission NPSG 07.05.01 - Reduce the risk of Surgical Site Infections). The CSR Pouch allows post-dissipation of moisture/sterilants used. The CSR Packaging Supplies must allow for post-dissipation of moisture as retained moisture would contaminate the product.<br />4. (Usability - Joint Commission NPSG 07.05.01 - Reduce the risk of Surgical Site Infections). The sterilization peel packs (pouch) when peeled apart, provides an uncontaminated separation of the laminate film from paper, maintaining the sterile integrity of the contents for presentation to the sterile field. The adhesive film on the peel pack (pouch) must not come in contact with package content to maintain sterility of package content.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO South and must be received by 5:00PM CST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</span></strong></p>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

The physician is responsible for teaching Family Practice Medicine to medical students, physician assistants, and other health professionals. Conducts initial and periodic health examinations for finding physical defects in need of correction, and prescribes and implements remedial treatments required to correct these defects. The physician administers immunizations to patients in compliance with established Indian Health Service and Billings Area policy. Makes necessary arrangements and authorizes admission of patients to the appropriate hospital. This includes authorization for admission to contract facilities for emergency medical care and surgery. Keeps the Service Unit Director, or designee informed of Contract Health Service (CHS) admissions. Records patient-provider transactions in the problem oriented medical record form and completes required data collection instruments, referrals, and medical records as required.

Skill in diagnosing and treating patients of all ages, with a wide variety of complex illnesses and severe injuries. Comprehensive knowledge of Quality Assurance concepts and skill in application of QA practices and procedures as they relate to general practice within an inpatient or outpatient setting. SUPERVISION: The Chief Medical Officer provides administrative supervision in terms of objectives to be met, with little or no technical supervision. Work accomplished by the physician is considered technically authoritative and usually accepted without review. The work is evaluated through the Quality Assurance Program, Governing Body and Medical Staff of the Service Unit.

SUPERVISOR: Debby Bends, Chief Executive Officer; ALTERNATE: Laura Herbison, R.N., Director of Nursing/Clinical Director. GUIDELINES: Guidelines include Public Health Service, Indian Health Service, Billings Area, Service Unit, and Medical Staff regulations, policies, procedures and by-laws.

In nearly all cases; however, the physician's judgment is the key factor in determining whether guidelines are to be adhere to or deviated or whether new guides need to be developed to protect the interests of the patient. COMPLEXITY: The work involves diagnosis and treatment of outpatients with an extremely wide variety of physical and emotional health problems. In addition to practicing within the General Practice scope, the Medical Officer performs other broad functions of medicine that includes education, prevention, cure and rehabilitation. Assignments are characterized by treatment of severe physical injuries and a wide variety of illnesses, some of which are so complex that other expert specialists are consulted. The work requires the simultaneous application of multiple knowledge, skills and abilities in traumatic life or death situations in the care of one or more patients. The physician's work schedule will alternate between the Outpatient Clinic and the Urgent Care/Walk-in Clinic. The work is often difficult and further complicated by the fear and skepticism of patients, undefined or ill-defined problems presented in advanced stages, and conflicting health data. The work requires continued efforts to establish health promotion - disease prevention programs to resolve chronic, community wide medical problems. The physicians are required to have current certification in BLS, ACLS and PALS. ATLS is required to work in the Urgent Care/Walk-in Clinic. ATLS is not required at appointment date but physician needs to be certified in ATLS within 6 months of appointment. SCOPE AND EFFECT: The purpose of the work is to provide direct patient, medical health care and treatment to patients, which directly affects the health and well-being of individual patients, patient's families and impacts upon the health status of the entire community served. PERSONAL CONTACTS: Personal contacts are with patients, families of patients, other medical officers, other health professionals, other ancillary employees, administrators and physicians from the private sector. Other contacts include (on an occasional basis) groups in moderately unstructured settings and representatives of tribal health, state and federal organizations. PURPOSE OF CONTACTS: The purpose of contacts are to obtain and exchange health information, resolve problems, educate, influence, and motivate individuals and groups to understand and accept recommended medical information, diagnosis, treatment, and therapies. PHYSICAL DEMANDS: Moderate physical exertion and stamina, extensive standing, bending and similar activities. May be required to move or lift patient from time to time. Will be required to work extensive hours (double shifts - 16 hour periods) with brief rest intervals. WORK ENVIRONMENT: The work is performed in an outpatient clinic setting, with continued exposure to patients having a variety of illnesses and communicable diseases. The physician may be subjected to adverse weather and hostile patients and/or their families. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The IHS shall provide all necessary equipment and supplies.

The Contractor will be required to comply with the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, "Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors," and the associated Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implementation guidance for personal identity verification for all affected contractor and subcontractor personnel. Access/clearance to all pertinent computer systems, including completing a Business Partner Interconnection Security Agreement (BPISA), should be coordinated with the Site Manager. CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR): The COTR shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractor's technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract.

Fingerprints must also be taken as part of the pre-employment process and must be completed before the physicians are allowed to work. The fingerprint check should be coordinated with the Administrative Officer. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. All IHS regulations and policies applicable to these Acts shall be enforced. The Contractor shall comply with IHS facility infection control and safety procedures, practices, and standards. Federal Tort Claims Act coverage for medical related claims is extended to the individual providing physician services. However, the services must have been performed within the scope of the personal services contract. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition.

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)<br />1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00.<br />(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence with respect to each vessel, boat, and/or barge upon which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies.<br />(3) Full coverage in accordance with the State Worker's Compensation law; and <br />(4) Full coverage in accordance with the United States Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />(b) As evidence that it has obtained the insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a certificate or certificates executed by an agent of the insurer authorized to execute such certificates. Such certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of the work. Each certificate shall state that (To be competed at time of award) has insured (To be competed at time of award) awarded contract number (To be competed at time of award) for repair/alteration of NOAA Ship HENRY BIGELOW in accordance with the Liability and Insurance clause and the Insurance Requirements clause contained herein. Each certificate shall set forth that each policy of insurance represented thereby will expire on (To be competed at time of award) and that each such policy contains the following clause: "It is agreed that in the event of cancellation or any material change in the policy adversely affecting the interest of the Government in this insurance, 30 days prior written notice will be given to the Contracting Officer."<br />(End of clause)</p>

   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
 
     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.
 
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin	
	
 
     (2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--
 
     (1) __ In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
 
     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

       (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
 
       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

     (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.
 
     (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
 
       [  ] TIN:  _____________________.

THE SCHEDULE OF LINE ITEMS IS ON A SEPARATE ATTACHMENT.<br />All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. This solicitation requires offerors of such products to submit all drawings, specifications, or other data necessary to enable the government to determine whether the alternate product is either identical to or physically, mechanically, electronically, and functionally interchangeable with the product specified. This statement warns offerors that the failure to furnish all necessary information may preclude consideration of the offer, stating that the alternate product will be considered technically unacceptable, if acceptability cannot be determined before award.

The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to a manufacturer, manufacturer's COC, FAA 8130, and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location. All parts shall be NEW approved parts.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) is marketing its capabilities as a potential subcontractor for both federal and commercial work (otherwise done outside the United States). FPI is interested in entering into agreements with federal agencies and/or commercial businesses for contact center services, using federal facilities and federal inmate labor. FPI will consider all reasonable proposals that support FPI's mission. The exact agreement that constitutes each arrangement will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.
<p>DESCRIPTION OF FPI: FPI, which operates under the trade name UNICOR, is a wholly-owned government corporation within the Department of Justice, under the Federal Prison System. The corporation was created by Congress in 1934, and provides employment, education, and training opportunities to inmates under federal custody. FPI operates more than 80 factories at approximately 70 locations. FPI's product lines and service operations are extensive, producing products and services in over 80 different Federal Supply Classes for sale to Federal agencies and the Department of Defense. FPI's mission is to employ and provide skills training to the greatest practicable number of inmates in federal correctional facilities necessary to ensure the safe and secure operation of such institutions and, in doing so, to produce market priced, quality goods and services, in a self-sustaining manner that minimizes potential impact on private business and labor.</p>
<p>CONTACT CENTER OPERATION AND CAPABILITIES: FPI contact center operations perform inbound and outbound B2B services. FPI's outbound B2B centers have performed data scrubbing, lead generation and profiling for some of the top companies in America. The benefits to using FPI contact centers are that FPI has skilled agents, low labor rates, native English and Spanish, high security, and nation-wide coverage. Another benefit is that FPI can provide additional capacity for commercial businesses seeking to grow their business or needing the additional capacity to take on increased customer demand.<br /><br />BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM: FPI currently has business agreements with private sector firms to provide services to the Federal Government, as well as services to the private sector in cases where the services would otherwise be performed outside of the U.S. For some business agreements, FPI provides fully equipped and staffed factories and provides services as turn-key operations for its private sector customers. For other agreements, FPI provides inmate labor and the physical factory space for contact center operations.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: FPI reserves the right to accept or reject proposals received. This notice fulfills FAR Part 5 publication requirements for individual proposals received and meets CICA requirements. Therefore, the intent is to enter into negotiations and/or to contract for services in response to this announcement, and a subsequent notice may not be published on FedBizOpps. Any materials or supply items that FPI procures for its use under the arrangement will be on a competitive basis. <br /><br />Submit proposals to: Clara Roberts, Contract Specialist, Services Business Group, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., Federal Prison Industries<br />501 Capital Circle N.E.Tallahassee, FL 32301<br />850-558-4033 <br />For additional information, contact&nbsp;Carolyn Sheedy, Program Manager&nbsp;@ 202-305-3717 or <a href="mailto:csheedy@central.unicor.gov">csheedy@central.unicor.gov</a></p>

<CONTACT>MiMi Martin, Contracting Officer, Phone 850-883-2675, Fax 850-882-9599, Email mimi.martin@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>Request for Information<br /><br />Introduction<br />The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Munitions Directorate is interested in developing far-term plans that may lead to innovative means to functionally defeat well-defended, hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs). The Munitions Directorate, with support from other AFRL Directorates, such as Directed Energy and Sensors, seeks to become better acquainted with and better understand innovative concepts and technologies that may be developed and applied over the next twenty (20) years to functionally defeat (deny, disrupt, or destroy) HDBTs. This may also include technologies that could improve HDBT functional assessment leading to a better capability to locate and characterize the targets. The purpose of this Request is to solicit concepts and relevant technology investment areas, assess technical maturity levels, examine top-level development timelines, and begin defining conceptual trade spaces. The requirements are described below:<br /><br />Target Scenario<br />(1) The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) is to seek information from all sources on innovative methods to functionally defeat the operation of a well-defended, hardened/deeply buried facility located within an unfriendly country. These innovative methods must be based on emerging technology or on technology that can reasonably be expected to be available by 2031. Emphasis should be placed on concepts/technologies that would functionally defeat such a facility for a given amount of time. Functional Defeat is defined as denial, disruption, or destruction of a facility's ability to accomplish its intended mission for a desired period. It is realized that this time period may not be easily defined. It will depend on the efficacy of the attack solution. Emphasis shall be placed on functional defeat systems that can be delivered to the HDBT or its close vicinity by current or projected delivery platforms. It is understood that some ambiguity must exist about the construction and intended use of the HDBT. For the purpose of this Request, it will be assumed that the HDBT functions as a key command, control, and communication node. Emphasis may be placed on directed energy applications for target location/characterization or for defeat mechanisms, either of which may be delivered to the vicinity of the target by conventional Air Force strike platforms, manned or unmanned. However, it is emphasized that this Request is not intended to pursue information, research, or development in regard to atomic or thermonuclear warheads.
<p>(2) For purposes of this RFI, the HDBT is assumed to be a tunnel complex with two portals built into the base of a granite mountain. The granite over layer is assumed to be 60 meters thick over both portals and 80 meters over the facility's mission space. Metallic blast doors are closed and hermetically sealed at both portals. The two tunnels are assumed to be 100 feet in length with directional turns. The facility is constructed on a single level and occupies between 10,000 and 20,000 square feet.</p>
<p>(3) The HDBT makes use of state-of-the-art computers and communication equipment. It is tied to the local electricity grid but has a large capacity diesel generator to produce its electricity when the need arises. The facility draws fresh water from an internal deep well. Sewage is held in holding tanks and removed periodically. All incoming air passes through state-of-the-art biological/chemical filters.</p>
<p>(4) The specifications of this HDBT have been deliberately left vague. Any questions related to subsystem characteristics and capacities may be directed to Ms Pamela Pitchford and Mr. Charles Cottrell (AFRL/RWAS). However, the answers to those hypothetical questions, if provided, may also not be specific. Be aware that all data with regard to this Scenario are notional and do not represent any known target.</p>
<p>Response Requirements<br />The following should be included in any response:<br />1. Describe conceptual approaches and requisite technologies to comply with the requirements specified in the Target Scenario.<br />2. Provide a top-level development schedule, based on the conceptual approach, leading toward the Technology Readiness Levels of 5 or greater.<br />3.&nbsp; Limit response to ten (10) pages, single spaced.<br /><br />Particular emphasis should be directed toward identifying existing or emerging near-term technologies that may be used singularly or in combination to provide an innovative means to address the functional defeat of the HDBT. All technologies or suggested concepts should be available for proof of concept demonstration by the Air Force within the nominal twenty (20) years after the issue of this Request.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. The government will evaluate the respondent's capabilities based on the following: <br />a) Thorough understanding of the Scenario requirements; b) Identification of conceptual approaches and requisite technologies to comply with the requirements specified in the Scenario; c) Description of the rough magnitude of potential costs to develop the requisite technologies to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5 or greater; and <br />d) Top-level development schedule. All responses should be limited to ten (10) pages, single spaced, and are to include the organization name, address, business point of contact/phone number/email address, and technical point of contact/phone number/email address.<br />Respondents to this RFI should stipulate any assumptions used in the development of their response. The Air Force anticipates that respondents will respond to the information request to the best of their ability with as much of the requested information as time permits by the specified deadline. No extensions to the schedule are foreseen.<br />This RFI is not a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Any information submitted is voluntary. The Air Force may contact a respondent for more information or clarification purposes. The Air Force does not commit to contacting a respondent or providing any feedback on a response. The Air Force does not intend to issue any findings or reports outside the Air Force resulting from the RFI. Due to the expedited timeline, questions may be submitted with the RFI response and may be considered in any potential future solicitations. <br />Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the AFRL Contracting Division, AFRL/RWK, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Bldg 13, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-6810, ATTN: Ms. MiMi Martin, or sent electronically to mimi.martin@eglin.af.mil. Please provide electronic responses with this subject: RFI for Hard and Deeply Buried Target (HDBT) Functional Defeat. Responses must be received no later than 0800 Central Time on 03 January 2012. For technical questions, please contact Ms. Pamela Pitchford, AFRL/RWAS, pamela.pitchford@eglin.af.mil, 850-883-2505, or Mr. Charles Cottrell, AFRL/RWAS, charles.cottrell@eglin.af.mil, 850-883-2723.<br /><br />DISTRIBUTION A. Approved for public release, distribution unlimited. (96ABW-2011-0541)</p>

It is likely that this or another classified deployment will be a requirement of the follow-on contractor. The&nbsp;contractor must have, at day one of contract award, the ability to receive classified deployment information, prepare to negotiate the requirement, and get to the deployed location within the 120 day phase-in timeframe.</span></p>
<p>In regards to Facility Clearances (FCLs), Chapter 2-102 of the NISPOM establishes eligibility requirements a company must meet before it can be processed for an FCL. One requirement is that there has to be a need to access classified information in connection with a legitimate U.S. Government requirement. In the case of the C-21 requirement, access to classified information is not required for a company to SUBMIT A PROPOSAL. The Government is not in a position to remove the requirement to obtain an FCL prior to award because a contractor must have a FCL the day of award in order to carry out the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>Even though there is a requirement to have a FCL prior to award, the Government cannot sponsor any contractors until there is a bona fide need for that contractor to access classified information for this C-21 CLS requirement. Take caution that if another contractor sponsors a company for an FCL for this C-21 effort, there are no guaranteed assurances that DSS will approve the FCL. Defense Security Services (agency responsible to the issuance of FCLs) have informed this agency that the FCL depends on a variety of circumstances such as completion of all FCL required paperwork, the identification of the company Key Management Personnel (KMP) who must obtain personnel clearances to the level of the FCL (if the KMP are uncleared this can take some time), FOCI mitigation, etc.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Questions and Answers<br /></span><span>Additional Questions and Answers are attached to this posting.<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE (1 Dec 11)<br /></strong></span><br />Due to a change in policies and procedures, the lead time to get Base Entry Approval has shortened.

<DESC>The United States (U.S.) Army, Army Contracting Command (ACC) Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG)-Command, Control, Communications Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Aberdeen, MD, 21005, intends to procure Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), AN/TPQ-50 systems. The ACC APG-C4ISR is conducting market research to identify possible sources to produce up to 56 LCMR AN/TPQ-50 systems that meet the technical performance requirements of the LCMR AN/TPQ-50 Performance Specification. <br><br>This notice is published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Part (FAR) Part 10, Market Research and FAR Part 15, Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposal.  This notice serves as a Request for Information (RFI) in support of market research. All information received will be used for planning purposes only. This notice does not constitute an Invitation to Bid, a Request for Proposal, or a Request for Quote. The government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it.<br><br>The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is a lightweight, 360-degree, rapidly deployable, man-transportable, digitally connected, day/night mortar locating radar that uses computer-controlled signal processing of the radar signal data to perform target detection, verification, tracking, and classification of enemy and friendly mortars.  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is an improved version of the AN/TPQ-49.  It provides simultaneous hostile weapon locations, discrimination and friendly fire observation of mortars, cannons and rockets.  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 has improved accuracy for mortar.  It is disassembled into man-portable cases which fit into a single up-armored M1152 or equivalent high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV).  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is assembled and emplaced on or off the vehicle by a two person team.  Interoperability requirements are delineated in the system Performance Specification. <br><br>The Army is contemplating a firm fixed price (FFP) production contract for up to 56 LCMR AN/TPQ-50 production representative assets and initial spares.  The contract will also include cost plus provisions for support; engineering analysis; and assessment and implementation of potential product improvements not identified at time of award.  The period of performance is anticipated to be 24 months.  The government does not possess a build-to-print technical data package (TDP) for the LCMR AN/TPQ-50.<br><br>Responses will consist of an unclassified white paper.  At a minimum, the white paper shall provide a description of the technical approach and a statement on the ability to meet the attached key attributes.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1012<br />Name:		Steno Book, 60 Pages, 6"x9", Green<br />Description:	60 page, eye-ease green paper, Gregg ruled steno book. Pages are 100% post-consumer waste (PCW) and 100% process chlorine-free (PCF). Book is 6" x 9" with top wire binding. UoI is PG. PG = 6 Books</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1013<br />Name:		Steno Book, 80 Pages, 6"x9", Green<br />Description:	80 page, eye-ease green paper, Gregg ruled steno book. Pages are 100% post-consumer waste (PCW) and 100% process chlorine-free (PCF). Book is 6" x 9" with top wire binding. UoI is PG. PG = 6 Books</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1012<br />Similar Items:	SPR01407; UNV76620; AMP25270; TOP8001; RED36646</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1013<br />Similar Items:	RED36746; UNV86920; AMP25274; AMP25474; SPRG69; UNV76920</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 21, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">The solicitation will be available in DIBBS at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/ on its issue date of October 7, 2011. </li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The total duration (base plus option years) shall not exceed 5 years. </li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. </span></li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</span></li>

<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307. </span></li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.</li>

<DESC>52.	Can we get a three-year claims history from the current bike operations?No. The Service does not have these records, and the requirement to provide them was not a part of the previous operator's CUA permit requirements.    
53.	Can we put safety/wellness signage along the trail routes?A request to provide signs will require the review and approval of the Park on a case-by-case basis.  If the Offeror intends such signs to be part of its offer, it should consider that such signs are not within the Concessioner's land assignment and are not provided for within the Draft Contract.  After award of contract, the successful Offeror may submit a proposal to the Park for signage. Offerors should not assume that such a proposal would be approved.  Offerors must respond to questions as asked and all conditions as described in the Prospectus and Draft Contract.    54.	Can we get annual revenue and rider numbers from current bike operations in order to understand exposure for insurance rating? The Business Opportunity provides much of this information.  Additional information is provided in the answer to Number 6, above.  
Proposal Package - Principle Selection Factor 355.	There are two sub factors described as requiring response in regards to "The Offeror's experience in providing Bicycle Rental Tours" (one designated as "3(b)" and one as "3(d)").  Are these intended to be separate sub factors with identical headings but different elements?Please see the Errata #1 issued December 2, 2011.
56.	There are two sub factors designated as "3(d)".  Is the sub factor described as "The Offeror's experience in providing Bicycle Rental Tours" intended to be designated as "3(c)"?Please see the Errata #1 issued December 2, 2011.
57.	Pertaining to Selection Factor 2 Subfactor 2(b) - Will trash and recycling dumpsters be provided by the NPS or be the responsibility of the concessioner?Please refer to the Draft Contract, Exhibit E - Maintenance Plan, Section B-1(J), Litter and Garbage (Page E-B5) for information on dumpsters.  The Concessioner must provide its own Service-approved dumpsters, which will be located in the parking lot directly behind its building.  Please see the construction drawings (as referenced in question #48) for the location of these dumpsters.    
58.	Is Subfactor 3(c) incorrectly labeled as Subfactor 3(d)?Please see the Errata #1 December 2, 2011.
59.	Pertaining to Secondary Selection Factor 1 Subfactor 1(a) - Will the concessioner be allowed to refuel vehicles at the fueling station off of Shuttle Bus Rd., and if so will CNG fueling be available to the concessioner as well?If the Concessioner has a CNG vehicle, the Service will allow it to be refueled at the Park's refueling station.  However, because there is commercial gasoline available in Tusayan, the Park will not allow the Concessioner to refuel at the Park's regular gasoline facility.  
Modification #1 - Below please find the National Park Service's (NPS) changes to a Concession Business Opportunity to provide Bicycle Rentals, Limited Retail and Food Service on the South Rim Grand Canyon National Park.
The deadline for proposals has been extended to January 6, 2012. Any proposal must be received by the Chief of Concessions, Intermountain Region, National Park Service, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, Colorado 80228 by 4:00PM MST on Friday January 6, 2012 in order to be evaluated and considered for award of a Concession Contract.

<DESC>This is a follow-up announcement to previously posted SOURCES SOUGHT N00019-12-R-0001. The Source Sought announcement includes details of the aircraft and general tasking required.&nbsp; The resulting decision based on the review of sources sought responses is that <strong>this effort will be&nbsp;solicited using full and open competitive&nbsp;procedures under NAICS 488190.<br /></strong>
<p><strong>DRAFT PWS:<br /></strong>The Government intends to post a DRAFT version of the Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) and associated DRAFT documents for industry's review and feedback on or about 01 December 2011.</p>
<p>The Government is receptive to ideas to reduce constraining requirements, reduce risks, reduce costs, and highlight potential safety, quality, technical or contractual problem areas. While the DRAFT PWS is not a DRAFT Solicitation, comments and recommendations pertaining to any part of the upcoming solicitation, including Sections L and M, as well as general comments on a best value basis for award are welcomed, including any concerns, questions, refinements, or suggestions. Comments on instructions for preparing and presenting proposal volumes on cost, past performance and other subjects are also welcomed. The Government expects to use a best value basis for award. The Government intends to implement a Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) to measure Contractor performance. The measures align with the Navy's objectives of Safety, Quality, Performance, and Sustainment. A performance incentive is likely to be associated with performance that exceeds contractual minimum requirements, measured by the PMF. Once the PMF is available in DRAFT form, the Government will solicit comments, recommendations, and questions that might further align and clarify the understanding between the Government and potential offerors, including whether the PMF is understandable and executable.<br /><br /><strong>The Government has prepared a list of questions (attached) and invites written industry feedback on those questions, or as noted above, in the form of recommendations and/or questions, which shall be received no later than 12:00 p.m. EST on 04 January 2012</strong>; however, the Government appreciates earlier written submittals.

<p><strong>INDUSTRY DAY CONFERENCE:<br /></strong>PMA-273 intends to host an Industry Day Conference to openly introduce the T-45 Total Lifecycle Support Product maintenance concept, allow industry parters an opportunity to network with one-another, and receive meaningful feedback regarding the upcoming requirement. The Industry Day event will be held on <strong>14 December 2011 at the Southern Maryland Higher Education Center (SMHEC) located in California, MD from 8:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. EST.</strong> Sign-in will begin at 7:30 a.m. EST. Attendance for the Industry Day is limited to three attendees per company. This is a no fee event (except a possible nominal refreshment fee)&nbsp;and seating is limited.

<p><strong>GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY ONE-ON-ONE's:<br /></strong>In addition to the requested written feedback, following the Industry Day conference, the Government invites interested companies to privately present meaningful feedback in-person as a preface to the written feedback due by 04 january 2012.&nbsp;<strong>Any exchange of information between the Government and Industry will be captured and documented to be made available to the public in accordance with FAR 15.201.</strong> The Government does not intend to discuss any portion of the acquisition strategy during the one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p><strong>One-on-One sessions will be scheduled between 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST on 14 December 2011, and 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST on 15 December 2011.</strong> The amount of time alloted to each company will be approximately one hour, but ultimately dependant on the number of companies scheduled. The scheduled time frames will be equal for each company and provided at time of scheduling confirmation. There is no fee to arrange a one-on-one session and seating is also limited to three attendees per company. Contractors are directed NOT to present or provide proprietary information during the one-on-one sessions. Information and materials submitted to the Government WILL NOT be returned. Classified material SHALL NOT be submitted. Responses and comments will not be published, nor will they be released. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for, any information received from potential sources as a result of this posting. The Government will not reimburse the attendees for any cost associated with participation or attending the one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Requests for scheduling Industry Day and/or Industry One-on-One attendance shall be submitted via email to Jessica McGee at jessica.mcgee@navy.mil no later than 8:00 a.m. EST on 06 December 2011.

<DESC>The existing License (No. 064LBF0446) with Pinnacle Tower Inc. expired on February 1, 2008 and has been in a holdover status since while NOAA and Pinnacle Tower negotiated language for new and succeeding Lease and License templates. NOAA and Pinnacle Tower developed a standard template Lease/License to be used in connection with succeeding documents for use of tower sites. An NWR License (No. 12WSW0202L) using this template was approved by the LRB on September 28, 2011 for a site in Nogales, Arizona. <br />This 1,656' tower is located at 1498 Tower Road, Moody Texas 76557, near (Lat 31&ordm;18'54" N and Long 97&ordm;19'37" W) at an elevation of 827' AMSL. The Government's proposed new lease provides for placement of equipment on the Tower including the attachment of lightweight tubing from ground level to two different tower levels (100 and 1,656 feet) and use of 350 square feet of ground space near the tower for placement of a government trailer/laboratory and a radon detector. ESRL also has mounted meteorological packages on the tower at these two levels which include a radio modem and 1 watt directional antennae to transmit data to ESRL equipment on the ground.<br />

<DESC>This serves as a "Notice of Intent"  to award a new purchase order under RFQ HHM402-12-R-0023 to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) for the acquisition of program management services by the Directorate for Information Management, Enterprise Operations Group (DS-OG) at Defense Intelligence Agency.  This procurement is contemplated to be a firm, fixed price of $117,082,000.
<p>DIA DS-OG has had an individual providing support for the past 4 years under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA).  Initial planning was for the requirement to end coincident with the end of the Intelligence Information, Command and Control, Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2 contract) in June 2010.  Due to unplanned and unavoidable delays in the award and implementation of the DIA Solutions for the Information Technology Enterprise (SITE) contract, a bridge contract between ICE2 and SITE was awarded.  Due to statutory limits extension of the IPA was not possible, DIA DS-  OG requires a six month contract to retain this support.  The contract will also include a 6-month option; wherein exercise of the option will be largely dependent upon the status of work moving off the bridge contract to the SITE contract.</p>
<p>The sole source purchase order is necessary to retain expertise and detailed knowledge of the ICE2 contract.  DIA DS-OG had obtained the support through the current IPA-in which the individual has provided services through 2005.  On the basis of the short time period required (i.e., maximum one year), it is in the best interest of the Government to retain the current expertise rather than transition to a new source-thereby requiring training and learning curve.</p>
<p>All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 703 605 5588, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  RE:  Note 22.</p>
