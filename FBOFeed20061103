<ARCHDATE>12152006
<CONTACT>Melody McGovern, 847-294-7347
<DESC>The FAA, Great Lakes Region, intends to enter into a single source procurement with Evans Consoles to modify/replace/re-configure the existing Evans consoles currently installed in the Air Traffic Control Tower at the O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois.  The current cab layout will be reconfigured to accommodate additional consoles. The firm will be required to work in occupied space during low traffic hours of operation.  The firm will be required to utilize the existing console system as much as possible to expedite the demolition and replacement process while eliminating the chances of accidental operation interruptions.  Should a vendor believe they are capable of providing this requirement the following applies:  The vendor will be tasked with utilizing as much of the existing console system as possible because this will allow for the majority of the power, control and grounding to be left untouched.  Rewiring new circuits, rearranging duplex outlets or moving control wiring would increase the change of an accidental outage in a live operational environment.  Any interruption to Air Traffic operation will cause economic hardship for the airlines and a major inconvenience to the flying public.  The vendor must be familiar with the Evans Console system installed at O'Hare and must provide parts that are 100% compatible.  The console replacement will occur in a live operational environment and must be completed within 3 months.  The FAA cannot tolerate any unnecessary risk/accidental outage at this Airport.  The timing of this project must align with an ongoing electronics equipment replacement project in order to commission the new north runway.  Firms that believe they can meet all the requirements as stated above should contact the Contracting Officer.

<CONTACT>Paul Griffin Contract Specialist 9077863818     paul_griffin@fws.gov;
<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska, on behalf of the Appraisal Services Directorate (ASD), in accordance with a seperate Memorandum of Understanding, requires contracting appraisal services for the valuation of non-Federal and Federal properties for a proposed land exchange between Doyon, Limited (Doyon), an Alaska Native Regional Corporation within the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS). If the proposed exchange were to occur, Doyon would receive free title to approximately 108,028 acres of Refuge lands and approximately 93,800 acres of leasable mineral estate that may hold developable oil and gas resources.  In exchange, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Government of the United States) would receive free title lands of equal value currently owned by Doyon, including quality wetland habitats, within the Refuge boundary.  Once approved, the appraisals will provide decision makers a basis to consummate and/or reconfigure the land exchange.  This significant exchange is complex and likely to draw controversy. To be awarded this appraisal contract, the contractor/principal appraiser must be licensed as a General Certified Appraiser in the State of Alaska.  The contractor will be expected to prepare the appraisals that are technically and legally defensible and in full compliance with the current edition of Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions, 2000 Edition (UASFLA) and the Statement of Work included in the solicitation.  All appraisal services will be paid for by the United States of America, US Fish and Wildlife Service.  ASD will be the sole client for the appraisals.  Doyon and FWS will be intended users, in addition to ASD. The contractor will be responsible for all aspects of developing and reporting the appraisals.  The contractor will be required to comply with the professional competency requirements in an appraisal assignment that includes potential contributory values of oil and gas, potential impacts on value of a public use easement and a subsistence easement, it is likely that the principal contract appraiser will have to complete the assignment leading a team of private staff appraisers, associate appraisers and oil and gas consultant(s) experienced with the physical environment of Interior Alaska.  Knowledge and experience of Alaska land laws such as the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) is required.  After submission to ASD the appraisals will be subjected to a technical appraisal review in compliance with Standard 3 of USPAP, Section C of UASFLA and the current version of the Appraisal Policy Manual of the U.S. Department of the Interior.  After completion and approval of the appraisals provided under the terms and conditions of the awarded contract, if necessary and requested by the contracting officer, the contractor may be required to provide additional services related to this procurement. An example would be if the contractor must be available for additional valuation services related to the exchange, such as appraisal of a reconfigured exchange and/or appraisal dispute resolution. Should events such as this example occur, the additional or reduction in services would be further negotiated and incorporated into the scope of work as a change order to the awarded contract. A detailed listing of specific services to be provided are detailed in Section C of the solicitation.  This contract will be for one firm year and one option year for a total contract period of performance of two years.  All contractor's must be registered on the Central Contractor Registration in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations subpart 4.11.  For registration information visit the web site http://www.ccr.gov. The solicitation issue date will be approximately November 8, 2006.   Please send your requests for this solicitation in writing including your company name, address, phone number and fax number.

<DESC>1. The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is developing a new generation of TT&C cryptographic devices to meet the needs of national security space programs and the Cryptographic Modernization (CM) program.  These new devices will be used to protect satellite and ground station command uplinks and telemetry downlinks from disruption or exploitation by non-authorized parties.   The Cryptologic Systems Group's Special Projects Directorate (CPSG/ZJ) is the developing program office assigned with the task of acquiring these cryptographic devices to support the modernization of Space TT&C for both satellite and ground control stations. 2. CPSG intends to award a single contract to modify an existing Crypto-Modernized terrestrial re-programmable COMSEC product, with options for production and software maintenance and support.  The purpose of the GOE I1 program is to ensure continuation of the current ground TT&C capability.  This will be accomplished by producing a NSA Type 1 certified ECU and, if required, any other hardware/software (ancillaries) that may be necessary to meet the legacy replacement requirements.  The GOE I1 will be based on a modified version of an existing NSA Type 1 certified ECU with Cryptographic Modernization features.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1) as approved by SMC/ISKP Justification Review Document (JRD) #06-03 dated 5 Apr 06 with Northrop Grumman Space Technology (NGST), One Space Park, Redondo Beach, CA 90278.  The Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) program office, part of the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) development of a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), intends to issue a follow-on contract to the STSS Research and Development contract F04701-02-C-0009 for two Block 2012 satellites.  The Block 2012 constellation is a continuation of previous STSS efforts that had begun over 12 years ago.  The first two Block 2012 satellites are required to replace the two STSS Block 2006 satellites in the BMDS testbed.  If options for additional satellites are exercised, these additional satellites will initiate the STSS operational capability and is consistent with the STSS Acquisition Strategy.  The constellation will be incrementally developed and fielded over several years.  Although the final operational constellation configuration is yet to be determined, 5 satellites are the minimum requirement necessary to transition the STSS program from a BMDS test bed asset to an operational functionality providing near real-time global capability to track ballistic missiles targeted against the United States or our allies.  The Government anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the current contractor Northrop Grumman Space Technology for the Block 2012 effort in the 4th quarter of FY07.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for Block 2012 will begin in FY08 with award of two satellites.  The basic contract type is anticipated to be Cost plus Award Fee (CPAF).  The negotiated contract shall provide, but is not limited to a CLIN structure that includes: a ground segment, space segment, systems engineering/program management, STSS Operational Control Station (SOCS), operations and maintenance/sustainment, spares, training, logistics support, special studies and award fee.  The contract will include unpriced options for up to three additional satellites including associated space/ground segment upgrades and a Mission Assurance Implementation Plan (MAIP), a list of military standards/specifications or equivalent engineering standards.   Contract award is projected for the 1st quarter FY08.  Northrop Grumman Space Technology has been a prime contractor on STSS and its predecessor programs since 1991.  It is anticipated that Northrop Grumman Space Technology will conduct a payload competition.  Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact the Northrop Grumman Space Technology, POC, Mr. Don Cline at (310) 814-1974 directly.  The small business size standard for this requirement is NAICS 541710 (1,000 employees).  

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request For Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  The subject RFP number was previously published on 28 July 2005 as FA8810-05-R-0002.   See Note 22.

<DESC>The Spanish Ministry of Defense (MOD) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the extension of Pier 1 at Rota Naval Base.

The MOD is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The MOD intends to use the two stage bidding procedure. 

At the contracting stage, tenders for the construction project should be sent in two separate well-identified envelopes, one containing the technical and administrative proposals and supporting documents and the other one only the bid amount. The construction project will be awarded to the lowest compliant bid.

Conditions on the economical solvency and technical reliability of bidders will be requested, including requirements on equipment, materials, and adequate experience. The Host Nation does not foresee the use of a Questionnaire to evaluate tenders technically or economically or to do a preliminary selection among the firms involved in the ICB.

The construction project will be awarded as a single package to a single contractor.  

The estimated value of this project is Euro 32 million (USD $41 million). The NATO reference for the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is JAL (DIN) 3NB07002. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-SPAIN-ROTA-PIER1.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The existing Pier 1 at Rota Naval Base is a gravity structure built with floating precast concrete caissons and protected by the Rota harbor western breakwater. It was built in the 1950s and extended in the 1970s. It has a mooring length of approximately 730 meters and in the southern part is able to receive ships of a draught up to 13.2 meters. An esplanade for heavy vehicles, 107 meters wide, lies from the pier front to the backside of the breakwater with some buildings on it dedicated to storage and port services.

Pier 1 is equipped with the services required in a Battle Damage Repair (BDR) pier: bollards, fenders, a portal crane (up to 50 tons), fuel (F-76 and F-44) stations, electrical power for ships and machinery (50 and 60 Hz at various voltages), communications, potable water, firefighting water, parking area and roads, alarms, lighting and closed circuit TV.

Support of Southern Region operations requires extending the current Pier 1 by 306 meters, dredging as necessary to allow NMMF mooring and the use of the required services.

The project is comprised of the following:

- Upgrade of current Pier 1

New bunkers for the electrical installation will be built and the current ones demolished, water and fuel pipelines will be replaced, pipelines for new waster and oily water disposal systems will be added and the esplanade pavement removed and replaced.

- Extension of Pier 1 

The Pier 1 mooring length is to be enlarged by approximately 306 meters, with a water depth of 14.2 meters below the lowest sea level, using the same building solution that was selected for the existing pier, i.e., concrete caissons filled up with granular material topped by a concrete superstructure at +6.00 top level. The new pier extension will be provided with all the current services in Pier 1 and new ones such as waste and oily water disposal systems, gas detection, and optical fiber terminals.

The superstructure of the new pier extension will have three service galleries, two as extensions of the existing ones and a new one to provide enough room for new services. The portal crane rails will also be extended along the new pier.

The space from the new pier front to the western breakwater will be filled to enlarge the existing esplanade. On the esplanade roads, a parking area and lighting system will be built.

- Dredging of the berthing trench

A berthing trench of 430 x 80 meters and 14.2 meters deep will be dredged along all the new pier extension and 106 meters of the old pier to allow for the berthing of the design ship (an aircraft carrier) in BDR conditions at any tidal level.

Dredging material will be placed into a confined area to be built close to the eastern breakwater.

Life cycle support of the new pier and its services is the responsibility of the Spanish Navy and is not part of the ICB.

BIDDING PROCEDURE

The existing marina pier is made up of a reinforced concrete platform, supported by piles. Once demolished, a new Pier 4 lying perpendicular to the coastline is to be built. The marina is protected by a small breakwater. The rock of this breakwater will be used in the protection of the confined area for the dredged material. 

- Construction of Pier 4 

Pier 4 will be 50.5 meters wide and 366.8 meters long, erected using cellular concrete caissons filled up with granular material and topped by a concrete superstructure at +5.5 meters top level. On the superstructure, the pavement, the berthing, and the fender elements and pier services will be constructed. A Ro-Ro ramp will also be built.

Pier services to be provided are a fresh potable water supply, sewage and waste oil collection, 50 Hz and 60 Hz electrical power for ships and services, fuel supply (F76 and F44), communications, water for firefighting, alarms, lighting and closed circuit TV.

A gangway 61 meters long and 16.88 meters will be constructed. The gangway will have two spans of prefabricated reinforced concrete girders, with a concrete caisson pile in the center supporting the length of it.

- Dredging 

A berthing area to allow for the berthing of the design ship in BDR conditions at any tidal level will be dredged, 11.0 meters deep all around the new pier. 

Dredging material will be used as backfill during the pier construction or dumped into a confined area located near Pier 3 inside the harbor.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC intends to extend contract NAS4-01029, Facilities Maintenance, Janitorial and Grounds Maintenance, and Minor Construction Services, for six (6) months. The incumbent contractor, DTI and Associates, Inc. currently provides maintenance, modification, landscaping, and support services for approximately 910,000 square feet of structural floor space. Facilities and infrastructure include office buildings, mobile/modular offices and labs, warehouses, aircraft hangars, computer rooms, industrial shops, laboratories, cafeteria, roads, parking lots, aircraft taxiways, aircraft staging areas, fences and storage containers. Associated equipment and utilities include water, irrigation systems, sewer, electric, diesel-electric generators, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, natural gas, compressed air, fire alarm, hydrazine alarm and storm damage control. NASA/DFRC intends to procure these services from DTI and Associates, Inc. of Arlington, Virginia.

A lapse in the services provided by this contract would prevent DFRC from completing its mission. The incumbent is in possession of the requisite knowledge, skills, and experience required, which will ensure continuous services during the interim extension period. Award to any other source would result in failure to meet the Agency's requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on November 17, 2006.

<DESC>Previously announced as a Sources Sought Announcement Reference-Number-NICHD-DESPR-EB-SS-2007-02.

The National Institute on Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) under the National Institutes of Health intends to solicit proposals with the requisite capabilities to undertake a longitudinal study to determine empirically if infertility treatments, such as ovulation-stimulating medications and the various assisted reproductive technologies (ART), adversely affect the growth, motor and social development of children from birth through age three years.  This requirement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS).

A growing body of scientific evidence suggests that infertility treatment may impact human health and development.  The number of children conceived with the help of infertility treatments currently comprises approximately 1-2% of live births in the United States, but the proportion is expected to continue to increase and the characteristics of the women undergoing treatment to change as more States begin to mandate health insurance coverage for infertility and ART procedures and as the efficacy of these therapies continues to improve.  A recent report of the U.S. President's Council on Bioethics called for: (a) improved monitoring of infertility treatments and outcomes, (b) long-term longitudinal studies to assess child health concerns, and (c) improved/expanded decision-making for parents and practitioners.  Moreover, the Council called attention to the fact that virtually no data exist for populations of such children with regard to their growth and neurodevelopment during infancy and childhood.  Given that a notable portion of children conceived with the help of infertility treatment are born early or growth-restricted, they are a subgroup of children at risk for developmental disabilities including subtle differences in perception, cognition, vision, or motor skills.  These endpoints are in need of systematic, empirical, and longitudinal investigation.

Choice of comparison population remains an issue for children conceived by infertility treatment or ART, given that the preponderance of literature has relied upon naturally-conceived children (assumed or otherwise).  More appropriate comparison groups, particularly for long-term outcomes among singletons infants, might be children of subfecund couples who become pregnant without ovulation-induction agents or ART.  To ensure sufficient power for a longitudinal follow-up, to have access to a large enough sample of women and outcomes (for comparison at various levels of fertility), and to avoid a lack of generalizability due to the specialized treatment regimens employed at individual clinics, any study attempting to answer questions (i.e., differential loss to follow-up, longitudinal trends, choice of controls) about the long-term consequences of fertility treatment needs to be population-based.  A population-based study is now possible because the revised U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth that is being phased in nationally includes a question about the use of infertility treatment in the Prenatal Tests and Procedures section, and that question can be used to identify appropriate children for follow-up.  

Objectives

A population-based sampling strategy will be used to recruit in a ratio of 1:3 a matched-exposure cohort of infants identified from pregnancies conceived with the help of infertility treatment, as noted on birth certificates, and children who were conceived without such therapies.  For the primary cohort, a total of 1,500 infants identified on birth certificates as having been conceived by infertility treatment (exposed) are to be enrolled as study subjects at three to five months of age (gestation-corrected, if necessary) and followed longitudinally for three years (until age 36 months), along with the cohort of 4,500 unexposed children, matched for maternal age, zip code of residence, and plurality of birth. All co-twins (or triplet siblings) of study subjects are also to be enrolled simultaneously and either their outcomes noted (e.g., stillbirth, neonatal mortality), or they are to be followed (secondary cohort) on the same schedule as study subjects.  Assuming that approximately a third of the birth outcomes from infertility treatment are twins or higher order multiples, the secondary cohort is expected to number 2,000 (500 twin siblings of exposed and 1,500 twin siblings of unexposed infants).  The period of recruitment for the cohorts is expected to last 10 months to one calendar year.  The sampling frame for the study is expected to be either a State or consortium of States that have real-time access to birth certificates and adequate numbers of births from infertility treatment to meet study requirements.

Parents will be asked to participate in the study for three years by: (a) completing an initial questionnaire about the pregnancy, including, for example, confirmation of infertility treatment, time-to-pregnancy, infant feeding, and other demographic and socio-economic factors (i.e., maternal education, occupation) and confounders associated with motor and social development; (b) completing a standardized screening instrument that addresses their child's motor and social development at chronologic or gestation-corrected ages 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, and 36 months; and (c) providing information on the child's growth and medical history (e.g., illnesses, diagnoses of birth defects, major impairments).  Whenever possible, records will be linked to other pertinent health records (e.g., early intervention programs, WIC, birth defect or cancer registries).  Depending upon State requirements, screening results will be communicated to parents, and parents expressing concern about their children will be given contact information for State-approved developmental assessment centers and early intervention programs.

It is anticipated that one award of a cost-reimbursement, incrementally funded completion-type contract, with a period of performance of four-years, will result 	from the RFP.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).

1.  RFP NIH-NICHD-2007-04 will be available electronically through the website FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) and the NICHD Website at http://www.nichd.nih.gov/funding/grantcontract/,Research and Development Contracts, Contract Opportunities, Federal Business Opportunities on or about November 18, 2006.  The Government does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP; therefore, Potential Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation. The electronic RFP for this Solicitation will include all information required for submission of an Offeror's proposal.  It is anticipated that proposals will be due approximately 60 days after issuance of the RFP or approximately January 21, 2007.  The reference number for this announcement is RFP-NIH-NICHD-2007-04; all correspondence must cite the reference number as provided.

The Wagner-Leith passive sampler (Wagner and Leith, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c) shows potential  for assessing PM exposure because it can be operated without a power source and can be miniaturized, making their deployment at multiple locations easy and cost-effective. Initial tests of the passive sampler have shown mixed results in terms of the sampler's ability to measure ambient mass  concentrations with acceptable accuracy and precision. Different rain shelter designs for the passive sampler have been used in these initial field tests and may account in part for observed differences between passive and actively-measured mass concentrations.  The contractor shall:   (1) Design  and test a shelter that isolates the passive sampler from wind and precipitation. The ideal shelter is one that affords protection from most precipitation events, minimally affects particle deposition velocity, and is inexpensive. (The goal is to keep the cost of the shelter less than the passive  sampler which is currently about $45).  The performance of the shelter in terms of its impact on the accuracy of the passive sampler PM measurements must be characterized over a range of wind speeds encountered in ambient monitoring. The contractor shall conduct wind tunnel tests at 0, 2, 8, and 24  km/hr on a passive sampler protected by a candidate shelter. PM10-2.5 estimated with the sheltered passive sampler will be compared to that measured with a collocated dichotomous sampler and a collocated unsheltered passive sampler. (The deposition model developed by Wagner and Leith to estimate  mass concentrations from passive samplers was empirically based on tests conducted with unsheltered passive samplers. The unsheltered passive sampler is therefore expected to yield the best agreement with active samplers). Three replicate sheltered samplers will be exposed at each wind speed to  assess precision.  The proposed shelter should demonstrate adequate shielding against precipitation events. Three sheltered passive samplers will be placed outdoors and exposed to a minimum of three rain events and three snow events. The passive samplers will be visually inspected for moisture  during and after each precipitation event and the inspection results will be recorded in a log. At the conclusion of these tests, it may be necessary to examine the samplers by microscopy in order to assess the integrity of the samplers. If requested, these samples shall be made available to the  EPA for analysis;  (2) Conduct a field evaluation of the sheltered passive sampler. Using the shelter developed in Task 1, the contractor shall monitor PM10-2.5 for five days at two locations in Iowa City, IA. Each monitoring site shall be equipped with 3 sheltered and 3 naked passive samplers  (to assess precision), a dichot sampler for PM10-2.5, and a wind speed monitor to provide hourly and average wind speed for the 5-day monitoring period. Because unsheltered samplers will be deployed, it will be necessary to perform the field evaluation during 5-day periods when no precipitation  occurs. If possible, the sampling should take place simultaneously at both sites (to see if the passive sampler can distinguish two different monitoring locations within the same urban airshed), but this is not a requirement. The contractor shall repeat the 5-day field test detailed above a second  time. PM10-2.5 from the passive samplers (sheltered and unsheltered) will be linearly regressed against PM10-2.5 measured with the dichotomous sampler. The accuracy and precision of the sheltered and unsheltered passive samplers for PM10-2.5 mass will be determined by comparison with the dichot  sampler results.  The EPA is requesting capability statements in response to this synopsis.  The statement should detail your organization's experience with this type of sampler and with shelters for passive aerosol samplers.  The capability statement should also include your organization's size  determination.  To be considered a small business, this procurement will utilize NAICS code 541710 "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences" with a size standard of 500 employees or less. The information submitted will be evaluated and used to determine what sources  can provide the services, and whether or not this procurement may be set aside for small businesses.  Otherwise, this procurement will be subject to full and open competition.  The US Environmental Protection Agency, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park NC intends to award a purchase  order for the above services.  All capability statements are due by 12:00 p.m. ET on November 20, 2006.  If submitting your capability statement via the US Postal Service, please use the following address: US Environmental Protection Agency, Attention: Rebecca Clausen, RTP Procurement Operations  Division (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

Receive Proposals: on or about 12/19/2006.  Estimated Cost Range: $1,000,000 - $5,000,000.  Time for completion: 360 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed.  If all the options are exercised the project could be extended to a total of 450 calendar days.  The Contractor shall provide all labor, material, and disposal required to renovate the building?s interior elevators as shown and as specified.  This work includes but is not limited to, associated architectural, mechanical and electrical assemblies and systems.  

Base Bid is for Modernizing six (6) existing elevators.  Contractor shall provide associated electrical work and firestopping.  Scope of work also includes architectural work in the elevator lobbies (clean and repair terrazzo surfaces and painting).  The base bid will include the maintenance of the six (6) existing passenger elevators during the construction period as a separate price.  The base bid will also include the maintenance of the six (6) existing passenger elevators for one year after substantial completion as a separate price.

Options for the renovation and maintenance of the freight elevator may be included in this solicitation.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government?s estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The RFP will be issued on or about 11/9/2006.  Proposals shall be received in this office on or about 12/19/2006.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  
Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in descending order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  

The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal Agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.
Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions. 

Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company?s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Ing. Julio C. Chevez G., Empresa Portuaria Nacional, Aptdo. Postal: 2121/3570 M.N., Residencia Bolonia, ? c. al Norte, y 1c. Oeste, Managua, Nicaragua, Tel: (505) 222 - 3837, Fax: (505) 222 - 2059       Port of Corinto Competitiveness Upgrade Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance on the Port of Corinto Competitiveness Upgrade Project. 

The Port is Nicaragua's principal port on the Pacific coast in the northern part of the country, approximately 120 kilometers northwest of Managua.  The Port serves as the major point of entry for all essential and commercial commodities. Between 1995 - 2005 movement of cargo through the Port has grown from 565,000 tons to 1.5 million tons.  However, although demand continues to grow, the capacity to handle these increases in volume has not kept pace.  

Improving the competitiveness of the Port of Corinto is a priority for the Government of Nicaragua.  Both the Ministry of Transportation and Nicaraguan Port Authority (EPN) recognize that the Port has outdated and inadequate equipment and systems to handle increased cargo throughput demand efficiently.   EPN recognizes the need for the Port to boost its commercial competitiveness by upgrading cargo handling capacity, expanding operating areas, introducing modern IT management and maintenance systems, improving security and reviewing operational procedures.  The implementation of key projects to improve the competitiveness of the Port will enhance the trade capacity and will have an important developmental impact on the Nicaraguan economy.

EPN provides pilot and tug service, operates and maintains the container handling equipment and works closely with customs on moving cargo.   Private companies provide stevedoring services, but the container crane and other cargo handling equipment are operated by the Port.    

The objective of this Technical Assistance is to provide EPN with a strategy to increase the Port's commercial competitiveness by upgrading cargo handling capacity, expanding operating areas, introducing modern IT management and maintenance systems, improving security and reviewing operational procedures.  The Technical Assistance will highlight critical areas for investment in the above-listed areas.  Improvements to the operations of the Port will improve the overall commercial competitiveness through increased cargo movements and lowered shipping costs.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $430,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their an original in English and one (1) copy as well as an original in Spanish and six (6) copies in Spanish of their Proposal directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM LOCAL TIME, December 14, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to design and manufacture a cryogenic neutron filter system for the Multi-Axis Crystal Spectrometer (MACS). This system is denoted the Monochromatic Cryo Filter Exchange system (MCFX). Specialized materials for neutron filtering will be delivered by the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). When maintained at cryogenic temperatures, these materials have high transmission for low neutron energies but they are opaque for unwanted high energy neutrons. The role of the MCFX system is to maintain suitable filter materials at cryogenic temperatures and to hold them in correct locations with respect to one another. By placing the cooled filter blocks between the sample and the detectors a background suppressing filter action is achieved. To avoid neutron transmission between filter blocks, interstitial volumes are filled with highly neutron absorbing material in the form of B4C cast into poly-urethane. 

The period of performance of the base Conceptual Design period shall be approximately 3 months from the date of award.  It is anticipated that two option periods will be included in the contract.  The Detailed Design period, option 1, shall be approximately 2 months from the date of option exercise.  The Manufacture, Assembly, and Test; option 2, shall be approximately 6 months from the date of option exercise.

This acquisition is expected to be unrestricted; therefore any interested offeror may submit a proposal.

A fixed-price contract is anticipated.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under RFP number SB1341-07-RP-0001.

THE RFP IS ANTICIPATED FOR RELEASE TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY ON OR ABOUT 3 NOVEMBER, 2006, AND WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET AT THE ABOVE WEB SITE.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Brenda Owens, Contracting Officer, Phone 404-331-5014, Fax 404-331-7696, Email brenda.owens@gsa.gov
<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO EXTEND THE RESPONSE DATE AND TO CORRECT THE FAX NUMBER.  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis for market research purposes only at this time. The General Services Administration (GSA), Southeast Sunbelt Region, seeks potential sources for the Investigation, Design and Construction services for building envelope water intrusion repairs at the US Courthouse, Tampa, FL. The contractor will be required to provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided) and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all design and construction work to meet GSA agency requirements. The Overall Estimated Construction Cost Range for this project is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. Completion time is expected to be between 360 and 420 days.  Solicitation for this project is anticipated 02/2007.


THE PROJECT 
The US Courthouse was completed in 1998 and has been experiencing a series of problems related to water infiltration through the building envelope.  The building is 400,000 sf and consists of 17 floors, plus a mechanical penthouse.  The overall height of the building is 380 ft. Several studies as to the cause of the water infiltration have been completed and will be made available for review after a request for proposal has bee issued. The components of the project include a systematic inspection of the curtain wall for water intrusion problems, the design of a repair(s) to correct the water intrusion, the construction of the repairs, the testing of the repairs, monitoring indoor air quality, interior finish work necessary to complete the required repair work, and roofing work.

The following is an outline of the project components:

1.	Systematic inspection:  The extent and severity of the problems are unknown since a comprehensive inspection of the entire building facades has not been performed. The contractor shall examine and disassemble (as necessary) the curtain wall system to determine the cause of the water infiltration.

2.	Design of repairs: Once the source or cause of the water infiltration has been identified the contractor shall design a repair procedure.  The procedure shall be submitted to GSA for review and approval prior to implementation. Any design that changes or modifies the structural load path shall be designed by a licensed professional engineer.

3.	Construction of repairs: Upon approval from GSA with the proposed repair procedure the contractor shall implement and the repair.

4.	Testing the repair areas: Upon completion of the repairs the curtain wall assembly shall be water tested to assure the adequacy of the repair work.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION IN ITS ENTIRETY.  SEE CHANGES IN PARAGRAPHS 2, 3 AND 4. Description: 1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  A-E ser vices are required to provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of complete Military and Civil works projects.  Projects will primarily be located within the South Pacific Divisions military boundaries of CA, NV, UT and AZ and the  civil works boundaries of CA, NV, AZ, UT, and portions of OR, ID, CO and WY.  The contracts may also be used by other Districts within South Pacific Division (Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Albuquerque Districts) to encompass the entire South Pacific Division geographical area of responsibility.  Use of the contracts outside the above areas of responsibility is subject to the review and approval of the contracting officer. This work will include all Architectural-Engineering (A-E) and related services necessary to complete the assigned task orders for studies and designs. A specific scope of work and services will be issued with each task order.  The North American Industria l Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541310, which has a small business size standard of maximum $4.5 million of average annual receipts for its previous 3 fiscal years.  This announcement is open to all firms regardless of size.  More than one contract  may be selected from this announcement.  The contract(s) will be negotiated and awarded within one year after the required response date to this announcement.  The total contract amount will not exceed $ 3 million for a duration not to exceed three years.   Since more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows:  (1) All awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order a ward in excess of $2,500.  (2) In making selection of the awardee to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost co ntrol, the firms strengths and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the scope of work for each task order.

<CONTACT>Anita Welter Contract specialist 3034452441     awelter@do.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is requesting information and sources sought for a bureau-wide apparel program.  Reclamation has established uniform and other Reclamation-specific apparel item requirements and requests industry's evaluation and/or comments prior to solicitation.  Interested suppliers are highly encouraged to review the attached schedule of items (the schedule of items attached in Excel format has 2 workbooks to review ? one titled "Optional specs" and one titled "Uniform specs"). (See Associated Documents)  Please also review the industry questions and provide constructive feedback to assist Reclamation.  This RFI does not constitute the intent to solicit or award and your participation does not guarantee that your company will be offered an award. Responses to this RFI may be in the form of both written responses and supplemental materials.  All responses or attachments should be in electronic form, with the documents saved in a format readable by Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or Adobe Acrobat.   Reclamation's national apparel program is established in support of its Visual Identity Program. The goals for the program are to: "	provide easy identification of Reclamation employee to the public; "	project a positive Reclamation-wide image with durable and comfortable clothing the maintains a neat appearance; "	ensure the highest possible degree of consistency in uniform appearance that is commensurate with the diversity of tasks performed by Reclamation employees; and, "	enhance Reclamation employee pride. The contractor must provide an apparel supply system that will provide items with timely deliveries and ease of ordering.  In general, Reclamation's uniform program will be a decentralized program with authorization, ordering, and enforcement control at the local level.  Reclamation has a bureau-wide Uniform and Authorized Apparel Committee that is responsible for overall guidance and policy.  Orders may be received from locations across the country and orders may be shipped to various locations in the United States. See attached Reclamation Office Directory in associated documents.    Order size may vary greatly from one item to multiple items.   The apparel items are broken into two parts-Uniforms and Optional Clothing.  Uniforms are items provided to employees or volunteers who are required to wear such items in the daily performance of their job. These items may include, but not be limited to, such areas as Fire Protection, Law Enforcement, Guides, Maintenance Staffs, and Emergency Operations. There are approximately 350 employees in these areas authorized to wear uniform items.  Plus, there are approximately 100 volunteers in these areas.  Optional Clothing is other apparel officially approved by Reclamation but not required as part of performance of duties.  There are approximately 6000 full time Reclamation employees (including those mentioned above) who may purchase or be provided such items.   Interested suppliers should review the list of items and comment on areas to include, but not be limited to, adequate and clear description, availability of items, projected quantities.   See associated documents for Schedule of Items. In addition to the list of items, Reclamation requests feedback on the following areas.  Please be a thorough as possible in your response. 1.	What are the typical sizes for the required items listed here? Are these sizes standard in your industry or must the sizes be defined further in a Request for Proposal (RFP)? 2.	Are the colors Reclamation is specifying for its clothing program standard in your industry or must the colors be defined further in a RFP? 3.	How would your industry determine that the listed items are of high quality? Does the industry follow ANSI, ASTM or other publicized standards and if so, please describe and list such standards as applicable to these items. 4.	How do you suggest better defining the font size for text to be embroidered on sleeves/chest of shirts? Reclamation realizes that font size may change based on size of shirt (i.e. petite women's vs men's XL). Is this adjustment of font a standard practice and therefore no further definition is needed? If this is not the case, please advise/recommend standard industry description for font sizes.   5.	Does the industry generally follow ISO certification standards or other quality control methods?  If so, please identify and describe these quality control standards. 6.	Describe a typical ordering process through a corporate uniform program such as the one described above. Include how orders are placed by the individual, payment options, delivery options, and order confirmation methods. 7.	For a typical ordering process such as the one described here, briefly describe how your company suggests it be set up. 8.	Reclamation assumes that the supplier has a standard inventory control method to ensure availability of apparel items that can be delivered within a specified lead time.  Describe a typical inventory control method and advise if this assumption is reasonable.  9.	Based on the information provided here, is there a minimum annual volume (number or items or dollar value) that is of interest to a supplier and at what volume level(s) would a supplier propose more favorable price points or discounts? 10.	What other information from Reclamation would be helpful and/or required for your company to submit a solid proposal aside from what is noted here.  Upon review of the RFI responses, Reclamation will finalize its requirements and may issue a formal Request for Proposals.

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information is to identify solutions for the inspection component required for USPS implementation of a National Facility Condition Assessment Program.

1.0   Scope.    The United States Postal Service (USPS) is seeking expert services to execute the inspection portion of the USPS Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) Program.  The results of the inspections will be reported via an automated reporting tool already subscribed to by USPS.

The Program shall follow guidelines established in ASTM E 2018-01 Standard Guide for Property Condition Assessments: Baseline Property Condition Assessment Process.  

2.0	Objectives.  

2.1	The FCA Program requires regularly scheduled inspections of USPS facilities.

2.1.1	Plants, approximately 300 in number with an average size of 400,000 square feet, will be inspected once every five years.
2.1.2	USPS Customer Service owned facilities, over 7,000 in number from  6,500 square feet to approximately 50,000 square feet, will be inspected once every three years.

2.2	The Contactor will utilize the Logistics Management Institute (LMI) web based Condition Assessment application, I-CAM, to store data collected during the inspection process and to complete cost estimates for deficiencies noted during the inspections.  Screen shots of the I-CAM application will be available during the solicitation phase of this program.

2.2.1	The I-CAM software is integrated with the Gordian PROGEN application which will be utilized exclusively for costing all deficiencies noted during the inspections
2.2.2	The I-CAM application has an electronic mobile data collection tool option integral to the application (though manual collection of inspection data is also available).

2.3	The USPS provided list of facilities to be inspected will be available during the solicitation phase of this program.  Based upon the parameters outlined in paragraph 2.1, the Contractor will develop an inspection plan for each of the first five years.  As discussed further in this document, the Contractor?s proposal shall incorporate efficiencies in the inspection process, travel itineraries, and data entry methods with an overall objective of streamlining the process and minimizing the cost to USPS. 

2.4	The inspection process must be detailed enough to determine immediate and long term cost liabilities for deferred maintenance and functional inadequacy.  (Deferred maintenance is defined as unperformed planned maintenance, repairs, replacement, and renewal projects due to a lack of resources or perceived low priority and deferral of that activity results in a progressive deterioration of the facility condition or performance.)  The inspection shall be non-destructive.  Results of the inspections shall include the facility current replacement value (CRV), a listing of deficiencies, a parametric estimate of the cost for repairs and alterations and a facility condition index (FCI) for each facility.  

2.5	A required element of each inspection is digital photographs.  Include photos of the front and rear of the facility, and sides (where possible) and photos of the deficiencies that are discovered (where practical).  All photographs shall be in digital format (.jpg) and provided either in the report database or on a separate CD-ROM.  Photographs shall be cataloged and numbered where they can be easily related to the report.

2.6	Quantity calculations and measurements, maps, drawings, sketches/figures, notes and any other information in sufficient detail must be developed and included in the report to document existing conditions, recommended corrections and quantities included in the cost estimates.

2.7	Results of the FCA program will be used to provide USPS executive management with capital planning information, budget projection information, scenario planning information and workload projections.

2.8	The individual FCA report must be posted in the I-CAM application and available to the USPS within 30 calendar days from the date of the Inspection site visit.

3.0	Contract Type.  

USPS anticipates that this will be an indefinite-quantity contract for a (two) 2 - year base term with four (4), two (2) - year options.

4.0	Administrative Information. 

4.1	The information gathered through this RFI will be evaluated by the USPS Facilities Organization and used to develop a request for proposal that will be released in early calendar year 2007.  It is anticipated that the 2007 Inspection Program will begin by April 1, 2007 with a completion date of approximately August 1 2007.  

4.2	Facility Access ? Inspectors will be required to obtain a security access badge issued by the USPS.  This will require completing administrative paperwork and submitting it to the USPS. The Postal Service will conduct security evaluation of employee(s) prior to issuing badges.

4.3	I-CAM.  The USPS has a subscription to I-CAM (Condition Assessment Module) provided by Logistics Management Institute.  The successful offeror will be provided training and full access to this database application.

4.4	Cost estimates shall be developed to address maintenance and/or construction costs to correct each deficiency observed.  The USPS has contracted with The Gordian Group to provide a cost database for building components and systems applicable to Postal facilities.  This application is integrated with the I-CAM database.  Since USPS uses this database extensively for accomplishing construction projects, it is to be used to develop cost estimates for correcting deferred maintenance items found during the FCA inspection.  The Contractor will be given access and trained how to use the Gordian PROGEN database.  
 
4.5	The USPS Program Manager will officially notify the Installation Head of the scope and tentative schedule for the annual inspection cycle (via letter or email).  Two weeks prior to an inspection, the inspector shall submit a form letter to the Installation Head outlining the inspection process and purpose.  Upon arriving at the site the inspector will briefly reiterate the scope of the inspection to the Installation Head and at the conclusion of the inspection the inspector shall discuss deficiencies found during the assessment and document the debriefing with the Installation Head.

4.6	Inspectors are responsible for having equipment and supplies that they need to conduct the inspections (e.g. digital camera, ladder, etc.).  At some locations, the Post Office may have equipment that the inspector can use.  However, the contractor must determine if the equipment is in safe, good working order before using it.  The contractor assumes all liability: 1) if injured while using USPS furnished equipment and/or 2) to repair or replace equipment if it is damaged.

4.7	Building components or systems which cannot be physically observed shall be noted as such in the report.  

5.0	Submittal.

5.1	Each Contractor is asked to provide a proposal that addresses how they would approach this task.  At a minimum the proposal should cover:

5.1.1	Minimum qualifications of inspectors.

5.1.2	Types and makeup of inspection teams (anywhere from licensed architects and engineers to mechanical and electrical contractors).

5.1.3	Approach to minimizing travel costs.

5.1.4	An inspection schedule that meets USPS objectives while minimizing costs.

5.1.5	A proposed inspection schedule with rough order of magnitude inspection costs for each of the first five years.

5.2	The submittals should be innovative and focus on meeting the objectives of the USPS, which is to gather the credible data required to support a robust maintenance and repair budget planning program at the least possible cost.

5.3	Since the inspection results will generate a substantial number of repair and alteration projects, offerors may consider packaging the two (inspections and projects) when in combination the total cost would be less than when inspections and repair and alteration projects are completed separately.

5.4	Due date:  15 Business days from date of announcement.

5.5	Statements of interest:  Prospective suppliers should submit their statements in three (3), three (3) ring binders, clearly marked with the Company Name and RFI announcement.  Information provided should include the following:

A. Capacity to perform the work nationwide
B. Size and capabilities of staff
C. Number and location of offices
D. Years in business (5 years minimum)
E. Knowledge of web based facilities management applications
F. Describe management of the following: facilities condition assessments, developing priority lists, developing 5-year plans for repairs, providing cost estimates for repairs, training of assessors, quality control.
G. References including contact information 
H. Information listed in 5.1.1, 5.1.2 and 5.1.3 above.

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Safety, Safety Improvement and Development Team (SIDT) intends to award a contract to an educational organization interested in providing Continuing Educational Units (CEUs) to FRA employees who attend training developed, delivered, and/or managed by the SIDT.  For the past two years, the SIDT delivered most technical training on the campus of Johnson County Community College (Kansas), and contracted with this educational institution for review of the course development, validation of learning objectives and pre/post testing, and providing CEUs for attendance at SIDT training.

The SIDT is responsible for providing technical training to all Federal and participating State safety inspectors and specialists nationwide, and attendance is mandatory for this target audience.  SIDT does not provide training to external organizations because of resource constraints, and because these courses are designed and developed for a specific regulatory audience.  The SIDT uses the SAT (Systematic Approach to Training) model to develop courses delivered to Office of Safety employees, and has customized application by developing a series of tools to perform up to three levels of validation for instructional objectives and pre/post testing.   

The FRA will deliver training in several cities throughout the Continental United States beginning in FY 2007 and future Fiscal Years, with delivery beginning in November 2006.  FRA will use hotel meeting rooms for training delivery, and training classes will begin either on a Monday or Tuesday of each week that training is offered.  

SIDT schedules about 60 training classes each Fiscal Year, and usually schedules 20 FRA employees for attendance at each class.  Course hours range between 20 and 30.  FRA will be delivering up to four training classes during any particular week, and this training may be delivered at more than one location in the same week.  FRA prepares both a training course catalog and class/course calendar by the middle of October of each year.  The catalog lists the course ID and name, number of hours, and course description with terminal level objectives.  FRA will provide both of these documents to the educational institution with whom we sign a contract, and will provide updated calendars if revisions are necessary during the training year.

The period of performance will be one base year plus four one-year option periods for a total of five years, if all options are exercised. The anticipate award is early December 2006.

The FRA will award one contract based on the best value to the Government, which will include price, past performance and the offerors? technical approach, including administrative requirements imposed on the FRA SIDT staff during contract implementation and management.  

Educational organizations interested in contracting with FRA should be aware of the following:  

1.	Each FRA training specialist develops enabling objectives for each course, and uses an in-house form to validate the level of learning for each of the cognitive and affective domain objectives.  The SIDT coordinator performs a second-level review of the objectives to ensure the instructional methods are suited to the level of learning the training wants to reach.  FRA also uses an in-house method for performing trainer and team coordinator validations of pre/post test questions if the training uses testing for a particular course.  

2.	The successful educational organization would also perform a validation of the course materials, objectives, and tests.  FRA will provide the data to the institution in either hard-copy or electronic format for review and filing.  FRA will provide these materials once for each course, regardless of the number of classes scheduled for any particular course.  If a course is modified, FRA would provide the updated course materials again.  

3.	The SIDT will offer about 1,100 student weeks of training in Federal  Fiscal Year 2007, and anticipates a similar number of student weeks in future fiscal years.  Based on analysis of CEU requests for Fiscal Year 2006, FRA estimates about 55 percent of students will request CEUs.  

4.	The FRA anticipates developing five new courses per year and revising five courses per year.

The list below indicates the administrative and logistical steps in the process.  The educational organization shall be responsible for compliance with these steps. 

1	SIDT training specialists will use an in-house form to validate attendance, and can either fax or e-mail the form from the contract hotel training site to the educational institution?s point of contact.  The educational institution must prepare the CEU certificates upon receipt of the faxed or e-mailed attendance form, and must send them to the SIDT training specialists via overnight package.  FRA prefers delivery on the Wednesday of each class, but must have delivery to the contract hotel no later than 9 a.m. on Thursday morning of each training class.  

2	The educational institution will provide FRA with an electronic version of the form which students must complete if they are interested in obtaining CEUs.  The SIDT training specialist will distribute the forms for completion during the first morning of the class, and will send those forms at FRA expense to the educational institution point of contact via overnight package delivery.  The SIDT training specialist will also enclose the original signed attendance listing in this package.  Currently, the U.S. Government uses Federal Express for this service.  

3.	If circumstances beyond the control of either FRA or the educational institution prevent delivery of the CEU certificates before the class ends and the students are released to travel home, the educational institution will be responsible for mailing the certificates directly to the students.  FRA presumes the forms provided by the educational institution will include each student?s mailing address, and would expect the educational institution to perform this service and to advise the FRA Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR) that they have done so via e-mail.

4.	The educational institution must prepare an invoice identifying each FRA employee to whom CEUs were issued, and submit this invoice to the FRA COTR for review and approval.  This invoice must be prepared no later than five days from the end of the month during which FRA delivered the last day of training for a particular class.

5.	The educational organization must provide a transcript of educational credits directly to the FRA students upon demand, but at least once each calendar year, and will advise the FRA COTR via e-mail when transcripts are sent to the students on a global basis.

6.	The educational organization must provide the FRA COTR with the name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address for both a primary and a secondary (back-up) point of contact.

Proposal Evaluation:
Technical proposals will be evaluated based on the offeror?s ability to meet the FRA?s requirements as specified above. Educational organizations submitting proposals must specify how they intend to meet of the performance for which they would be accountable.  Offerors shall provide at least two examples of past performance for efforts similar to this requirement, including a brief description of the work performed and point-of-contact information (name, address, phone and e-mail, and contract number if applicable).  

Cost proposals must specify the number of CEUs offered per 10-hour block of instruction, the cost to FRA for each student CEU, the costs for course evaluating, and any administrative costs.  The proposal may total costs into one category, i.e. - costs per CEU include the total costs, or may separate the costs into two or more categories.  If the costs are separated into categories, the estimate should include five new and five revised courses for each year.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.   Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (GC-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.
