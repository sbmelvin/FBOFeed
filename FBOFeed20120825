Product No. DESCRIPTION

The Anesthesiology & Pain Management Service at the Dallas VA Medical Center needs to purchase a MRI compatible anesthesia machine to provide anesthesia to patients undergoing radiological scans. The type of machine required includes the following specifications:
1.  Developed for 1.5 Tesla and 3 tesla MRI environments / Distance to center of magnetic field: fringe field strength of 40 mtesla (400 gauss) or less
2.  Compact Breathing System
3.  High resolution 6.5” TFT color display and LED alarm indicators
4.  Vapor 2000 system
5.  Electronically controlled and driven, high-precision ventilator with volume controlled an pressure controlled modes
6.  Able to interface with the Draeger Innovian software currently used by all Anesthesia providers for electronic patient record documentation. 
Monitoring
Continuous monitoring of inspiratory O2 concentration, frequency, tidal volume, minute volume, mean or plateau pressure, peak airway pressure as well as PEEP. In addition, all fresh gas flow information is displayed as virtual flow tubes.
Serial interface 1 x RS 232 (standard)
Protocols Medibus
Volume of CO2 absorber 1.5 Liter, Option: Dräger Medical’s prefilled CLIC absorber
Volume of entire compact 1.7 Liter + bag breathing system
Gas supply from supplementary • with pin-index connections or MR compatible cylinders • with threaded connectors
Auxiliary Oxygen Flowmeter
Fresh-gas flow 0 to 10 L/min
Anesthetic Agent Vaporizer 
2 position Dräger mount
Dräger Isoflurane Vapor 2000, Dräger Sevoflurane Vapor 2000
S-ORC (Sensitive Oxygen Ratio Controller)
S-ORC is a control element which guarantees a minimum O2 concentration in the fresh gas flow.
As from a flow rate of approx. 200 mL/min., the N2O concentration in the fresh gas can be freely set between 0 and 75 %. During O2 shortage S-ORC limits the N2O concentration in the fresh gas, so that the O2 concentration does not drop below 23 vol.%. S-ORC prevents N2O flow, when N2O metering valve is open and O2 metering valve is closed or O2 flow is less than 0.2 L/min. During N2O failure O2 may still be administered. No alarm.
Range and accuracy of 0 to 10 L/min ±10 % of full scale at STP, total fresh gas flow meter calibrated with 50 % O2/ 50 % N2O gas mixture
0 to 10 L/min ±15 % of full scale at STP for all other gas mixtures
O2 flush (bypass) at 55 psi (3.8 kPa x 100): max. 50 L/min at 50 psi (3.8 kPa x 100): max. 35 L/min
Dimensions W x H x D
Base unit (caster) approx. 78 x 140 x 92 cm
with central brake locked (31 x 55 x 36.3 in)

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.  (g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of- name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to       (A)  Change the name in the SAM database;       (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and       (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.     (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g) (1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i) (C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.    (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.  (h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.  (End of Clause)
