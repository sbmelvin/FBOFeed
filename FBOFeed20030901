<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Negotiate Sole Source Contract with Ondeo Nalco Company
<DESC>Under statutory authority 41 U.S.C. 253, the VA Medical Center, Dayton, OH anticipates entering into a sole source procurement for the VISN 10 Network Facilities with Ondeo Nalco Company for the rental of Trasar equipment and the chemicals and test kits as required for the chillers for the fiscal year 2004. We had a hands free delivery system installed that has saved money on chemical purchase, and use improved efficiency of the system, which resulted in saving on energy costs.  The company has provided continuous trainig to our staff and provided immediate response to concerns with our chemical program. The uniqueness of their system would make it impossible to use another company without removing Nalco's system and installing another system if available.  During the changeover, the employees would have to return to manual feeding of chemicals, which have proven very costly and inefficient in the past.  We are realizing reduced utility costs and a cleaner distribution and return system with Nalco. The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements and intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by September 15, 2003.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Solicitation packages are not available.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Information should be submitted to the VA Medical Center, Attn: Kathie Nielsen (90C), 4100 West Third Street, Dayton, OH 45428.  Fax 937-267-7688.  All requests for information, or parties interested in providing information, must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer.  NO telephone requests will be accepted.
