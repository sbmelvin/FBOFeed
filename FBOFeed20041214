<SUBJECT>A -- Novel Satellite Communications (NSC) Program (Phase II)
<SOLNBR>BAA05-10
<RESPDATE>021105

<CONTACT>Michael Zatman, Program Manager, DARPA/SPO, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-812-3987, Email mzatman@darpa.mil - Jennifer Schoen, Contracting Officer, Phone (703)696-2440, Fax (703)696-2208, Email jschoen@darpa.mil
<DESC>The goal of the NSC Program is to develop technologies that enable a satellite communications system to receive signals from a ground-based user located close to multiple ground-based jammers.  Phase I of the Program is already underway, collecting data that can be used to test and measure new jammer nulling phenomenologies.  Phase II will involve development of the necessary algorithms and coding schemes; assessment of their performance; determination of the signal processing hardware required; and identification of the critical technology development necessary to enable the Program goal.  Phase III will develop a system to demonstrate these technologies and Phase IV will demonstrate them. DARPA is soliciting proposals under this BAA for Phase II.  One or more awards are anticipated.  Under this study effort the contractor will develop signal processing and coding techniques that enable a ground based user located close to several jammers to uplink to a communications satellite. The contractor will also have to consider how the processing and coding techniques used interact with the rest of the satellite communications system.  The contractor will assess the performance of this system, using analysis, simulation and Phase I data.  The contractor will identify critical technology development required to enable the system concept. Preliminary schedules have been set for two briefings of interest to potential proposers.  A Proposers Briefing will be held at the MITRE Corporation in Bedford, MA on December 15, 2004.  Potential proposers are also invited to the final program review of NSC Phase I at BAE Systems in Nashua NH on December 16, 2004.  Both meetings will be classified Secret.  Potential proposers should indicate their interest via e-mail to nsc@darpa.mil. Proposal Classification and Submission: This program will be run at the Secret level of classification. All potential proposers must obtain the NSC Security Classification Guide (SCG) prior to proposal preparation.  Performers must have the required personnel clearances, cleared facilities, storage, and processing capabilities to submit a proposal for this solicitation as defined in the SCG.  Copies of the SCG can be obtained by sending an e-mail request to nsc@darpa.mil.  Proposals cannot be mailed or hand-delivered to DARPA without prior arrangement with the DARPA the NSC Program Security Officer:  Ms. Megin Young, (703) 248-1514, mmyoung@snap.org.  This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time while the BAA remains open.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, proposals must be received by DARPA on or before 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, February 11, 2005. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that will be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a cooperative agreement, procurement contract, technology investment agreement, other transaction for prototype agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances. EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are, in order of importance: (a) Scientific and Technical Merit; (b) Offeror Qualifications; (c) Cost Realism.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the parts of a proposal from proposal respondents.  Proposals may be selected and/or award decisions made without discussions or negotiations.

<DESC>This Statement of Work (SOW) is based upon the statutory authority found in Title XI of the Social Security Act, Part B (hereinafter referred to as the Act), as amended by the Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982.  This legislation established the Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization Program, now known as the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Program.  Based on legislative language and the experience of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in administering the Program, CMS has identified the following requirements of the QIO Program:

1.	Improve quality of care for beneficiaries;

2.	Protect the integrity of the Medicare Trust Fund by ensuring that Medicare only pays for services and items that are reasonable and medically necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate (e.g., economical) setting; and

3.	Protect beneficiaries by expeditiously addressing individual cases such as beneficiary complaints, provider-issued notices of non-coverage (HINNs, NODMARs, and Medicare Advantage appeals), EMTALA violations (dumping), and other statutory responsibilities.

The statutory mission of the Program, as set forth in Section 1862(g) of the Act, is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, economy, and quality of services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends increase the ceiling by sixty percent (60%) to issue orders on multiple occasions within the original three year ordering period under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00024-03-G-4008 with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) of 65 Marcus Drive, Melville, NY 11747.  An unanticipated surge in AN/SPQ-9B Radar System work requirements has used up the authorized ceiling within the first twenty (20) months of the BOA’s ordering period.  The BOA was awarded on 9 January 2003 and runs through 8 January 2006.  It provides for the issuance of multiple orders for equipment changes, Ordnance Alteration (Ordalt) Kit installation, repair parts, repair effort (including emergency repairs), and engineering services and support for Ordalt installation, checkout, and testing for the AN/SPQ-9B Radar System and all associated peripheral equipment.  Orders may include tests and evaluation, fabrication of alteration, engineering changes, and field changes,!  overhaul, refurbishment and maintenance of the AN/SPQ-9B Radar System.  In appropriate cases, orders will be issued to open and inspect equipment to determine the extent of needed repair, alteration, and overhaul work.  The BOA allows for the placement of firm fixed-price (FFP) type contract or cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) type contract orders.  NGC is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and sole producer of the AN/SPQ-9B Radar System.  Therefore, no other firm possesses the technical expertise necessary to perform the work that will be required by the Government.  The BOA will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  This synopsis is for informational purposes only and the benefit of potential subcontractors.  The government intends to solicit and negotiate only with the source identified herein.  Parties interested in pursuing subcontracting opportunities are encouraged to contact the subcontracting department at the above address.  See Numbered Note(s): 22!!

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract on a Sole Source basis to Benthos, 49 Edgerton Drive, North Falmouth, MA 02556-2826 for the following item:  Model 867-A Shallow Water Transponding release - Quantity 6 each.  The Government plans to issue a request for written quote on or about 2004 Dec 21 to Benthos using FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.  The anticipated award date is 2005 January 12.  This action is being processed on a Sole Source basis to ensure interfacing requirements are met among old and new units.  The Benthos deck units are not compatible with other manufacturer’s transponders.  To attempt to use another Company’s transponder products would require the Government to purchase another deck unit, thereby resulting in a duplication of previously expended costs and a reduction in compatibility.  Any Company that believes it has the capability to meet the Government’s minimum requirements is invited to submit a quote for Government evaluation.    All proposals from responsible sources will be considered.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is requesting contract proposals for the design, development and feasibility testing of a prototype control system that will enable motor function of paralyzed upper limbs in spinal cord injured patients.  The overall project will include development of an external controller device that can receive and process cortical signals pertinent to motor control and translate the signals into appropriate Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) signals for a targeted upper limb motor function.  It will also include development of mathematical and computational algorithms for processing, translating and generating FES signals, and a demonstration of clinical feasibility involving persons with upper limb paralysis due to the spinal cord injury.  The project should include detailed system specifications, discussions of the proposed specific modality of cortical signal and the approach to algorithm development, adaptability/modularity of the system design for future inclusion of new technologies and signal input such as sensory and kinematic feedback signals, diagnostic and assessment measures, development of a plan for clinical and human subject safety issues and plans for overcoming potential barriers.  The formation of a synergistic, multidisciplinary team of experts in several fields will be the foundation of the project.  The research team will include but not be limited to, bioengineers, neuroscientists, computer scientists and clinical researchers.  Specifically, the Offeror must demonstrate: a) the availability of medical rehabilitation expertise to design and development of a control system for the target upper limb muscle(s); b) ability to develop appropriate mathematical and computational algorithms with specification of the nature of movements (e.g. reaching, grasping, etc.) for these initial algorithms; c) the ability to design elements and specifications to address potential interference problems with technologies (i.e. radiofrequency/wireless technologies); d) experience in interacting with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experts in medical devices; e) to design and test the controller that will interface with cortical implant signals and a FES motor control system; and f) ability to identify an accessible and appropriate patient population and health care personnel for the feasibility testing of the FES controller that will interface with  the human subjects.   The Request for Proposals, RFP NICHD-2005-05 will be available on or about December 28, 2004.  All responsible organizations are encouraged to submit a proposal that will be due March 10, 2005.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Hamdo Katica, General Manager, BH Telecom, Obala Kulina bana 8, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Phone: +387 33 232 651, Fax: +387 33 221 111.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a pilot project on the deployment of a broadband metropolitan network in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The objective of this pilot project is to test and demonstrate the utility and benefits of the deployment of a broadband network throughout metropolitan areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The implementation of this network would provide fixed-line bundled telecommunications services to businesses and individual citizens, and provide a platform for the development of e-commerce solutions.

The telecom sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina is severely underdeveloped due primarily to war in the region in the 1990’s.  Current user numbers indicate that just over 20% of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s population have access to fixed-line telecommunications.  Internet penetration in Bosnia and Herzegovina is just above 2%.  

In an effort to solve this problem, BH Telecom is interested in deploying a metropolitan broadband network that would dramatically increase access to broadband in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s urban locations.  This network would allow for telecom, Internet, and cable TV services to be transported through a “bundled” service enveloped in one phone line.  Bundled services are extremely efficient.  Consolidating telecom, Internet, and cable TV services to just one phone line reduces costs for both the operator and the customer, and makes it easier to manage problems and changes in services.  Most importantly, the new network would lead to a broader range of communications services available to the public.

BH Telecom plans to leverage the deployment of this new network via their existing copper and fiber backbone infrastructure.  By placing this new technology on top of their existing backbone, BH Telecom would be able to provide bundled data transmission services to users such as large companies, government offices, and educational institutions located in the metropolitan areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  This project would allow Bosnia and Herzegovina to bypass significant phases of telecommunications development and leapfrog to the latest state-of-the-art broadband network.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $490,800 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by FEBRUARY 1, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@ustda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Communications and Information Agency of Uzbekistan, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: E-Government Implementation Plan and Taxation Pilot in Uzbekistan  :  The Communications and Information Agency of Uzbekistan (UzACI) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance on an e-government implementation plan and taxation pilot in Uzbekistan.  In addition to evaluating current e-government strategies and policies and benchmarking them against other countries, the technical assistance will include organizing a government-wide workshop to discuss the current infrastructure and future options for e-government; developing a conceptual design and defining technical requirements for a target e-government enterprise architecture; conducting an environmental assessment; and elaborating a strategic e-government implementation plan.  The technical assistance will also cover the development and implementation of an e-taxation pilot program in Syrdarya, a small city near Tashkent.

Over the past few years, development of the information and communications technology (ICT) sector in Uzbekistan has become a major priority for the Government of Uzbekistan and one of the primary factors for the country’s economic growth.  A 2002 Presidential Decree called for the widespread introduction of IT technologies, including the creation of e-government, throughout the country.  Uzbekistan developed a National ICT Strategy as a result.  The ICT Strategy addresses many issues, such as increased efficiency in government management operations through electronic technologies, establishing an environment for free access to information, and enhancing intergovernmental communications.  However, it remains more of a vision statement than a concrete, sequential implementation plan.  Efforts have not been coordinated among government ministries and agencies, and most of the systems that have already been implemented are incompatible with one another.  The Government of Uzbekistan has not been keeping centralized statistics on the current state of ICT penetration, and critical legislation needed for e-government implementation has not yet been adopted.

With these needs in mind, the Government of Uzbekistan now recognizes that it is necessary to establishing a comprehensive e-government strategy and implementation plan separate from overall ICT development.  The Cabinet of Ministers and UzACI have requested assistance in developing an implementation plan that would define the Government of Uzbekistan’s current IT and organizational environment, and provide a sequencing plan for transitioning from the current to the targeted IT architecture, including coordination of government efforts; enhancement of networks and information systems; and development of new applications.  Such a plan must also realistically assess existing human resources capabilities and outline training needs.  In 2003, USTDA sponsored a Defintional Mission that recommended technical assistance to address these issues.  

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $502,600 grant to UzACI from USTDA.


A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.

It is projected that a Follow-On Competitive action will be awarded sometime in the FY06 timeframe for a substantial quantity of DSU-33 Proximity Sensors.  The DSU-33B/B Proximity Sensor is a nose mounted RF proximity sensor used on general-purpose bombs and the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). The DSU-33B/B provides a sensor fire pulse to a fuze, which in turn initiates bomb detonation at a Height-of-Burst (HOB), nominally 20 ft.  The HOB detonation capability enhances the performance of general-purpose bombs and JDAMs for some above ground targets.  The DSU-33B/B can provide a fire pulse to the following fuzes: FMU-139/B, FMU-139B/B, FMU-139A/B and the FMU-152A/B.  Power for the DSU-33B/B is provided by an internal battery, which is initiated by either a FZU-48 or the FZU-55A/B in the Air Force configuration, or the Fuze Function Control Set in the Navy configuration.  The sensor is qualified (certified) for use on the following aircraft and each variant in their series: Marine AV-8, Navy/Marine F/A-18, and Air Force A-10, F-15, F-16, F-22, F-111, B-52, B-1 and B-2 including FMS versions.  The major components of the sensor include a thermal battery, an electronics assembly, and support housing.  The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Interested parties must have a qualified sensor and may submit statements of capability (SOC) or capabilities package addressing the following: 1) Demonstrated technical knowledge of proximity sensor requirements for operational performance, interface requirements for JDAM and other munitions/general purpose bombs, interface requirements for required US and Allied aircraft, and system safety requirements; 2) Adequate production facilities and production capabilities to produce and assemble proximity sensor hardware; 3) Ability to perform acceptance and other required tests of the proximity sensors in accordance with Contractor developed and Government approved plans; 4) Ability to deliver qualified sensors in accordance with production schedule.  Responders to this synopsis will not be provided the results of the government evaluation of their qualifying package.  Responses to this synopsis should be submitted for receipt by the Government within 15 days of the publication date and must state whether the potential source is a small business concern IAW FAR 52.219-1. The NAIC Code/Size Standards is 332995/500 employees.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Interested sources should contact Melissa A. Johnson, Contracting Officer, 850-882-8787 ext 3109, or Julia Woodard, Contract Specialists, 850-882-8787 ext 2149, FAX (850) 882-1003.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

Please respond to these questions at your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm  EST on 8 Oct 2004.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact the  contractual POC listed below.

The above items can be made available upon written request and demonstrated  interest in this program.

<DESC>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) anticipates issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for offers to administer the Department of Defense (DoD) National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship Program on or about 01 Feb 05.  The NDSEG program promotes education in science and engineering disciplines relevant to the defense mission through three-year graduate fellowships to U.S. citizens who have demonstrated ability and special aptitude for advanced training in science and engineering.  Preference is given to applicants who indicate an intention to pursue a doctoral degree in science, math, and engineering (SME) discipline.  NDSEG Fellows may choose U.S. institutions of higher education with an accredited program in the appropriate SME discipline.  Recipients of NDSEG Fellowships do not incur any military obligation.  The NDSEG Fellowship program provides monthly stipends to the Fellows as well as payment of full tuition and required fees to the institution of choice.  Each application will be evaluated and ranked by a disciplinary panel of academic experts from the science and engineering discipline of the applicant’s proposed advanced degree program.  Final selection of awardees is made by the three participating DoD services:  the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the Army Research Office and the Office of Naval Research.  The current stipend amount starts at $30,500, prorated monthly based on a twelve-month academic year.  The present contract (F49620-02-C-0041) was awarded in August 2002.  The contract covers the administrative cost of the program and allows for transfer of funds (pass through funding) to the contractor to pay participants’ stipends and academic fees.  The present contract’s period of performance for the pass through funding is scheduled to end July 2005.  AFOSR plans to compete and issue a follow-on contract.  AFOSR is seeking qualified sources to provide the necessary personnel, accounting, administrative and database management services, and other resources required for the administration of the NDSEG Fellowship program.  The successful offeror will be required to work with the incumbent contractor, as necessary, to smoothly transition administration of the program, as well as be required to transition administration of the contract to a successor contractor when the contract performance period ends.  Functions required to administer the program include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:  advertising the NDSEG Fellowship program; soliciting qualified applicants; collect and receipt of applications in a secure electronic (online) format; distribution of applications among the disciplinary panels for evaluation to the three participating DoD services for selection; making offers of appointment to selected applicants and notifying unsuccessful applicants; administering payment of stipends to Fellows and payment of tuition and required fees to institutions; gathering and maintaining data, suitable for analysis and presentations, from current and former participants and unsuccessful applicants; organize a yearly NDSEG conference.  DoD anticipates awarding a minimum of one hundred (100) and a maximum of three hundred (300) new three-year NDSEG Fellows each fiscal year subject to the availability of funds.  AFOSR anticipates a contract with a potential length of seven years to cover five Fellowship classes.  Under the proposed contract, the administration provided by the contractor will be through a Cost Plus Fixed Fee arrangement, while the pass through funds for students’ stipends, tuition and fees will be through a Cost Reimbursable arrangement.  The proposed service North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS Code) is 56110, Management Services, size standard $5.0M.  Respondents should identify if they are a small disadvantaged business based on this NAICS code.  Interested sources are requested to provide a concise capability statement, limited to three pages, addressing past three years of experience relevant to the above described functions, to include:  experience in similar programs; knowledge of appropriate means to publicize the program and recruit participants; familiarity with issues related to conducting research in science and engineering; ability to attract university faculty members of the science and engineering community to serve on evaluation panels; cost accounting and financial management systems adequate to track costs, issue stipends and pay academic expenses; database management capabilities to gather and maintain data; and other resources necessary to conduct a program of this magnitude in a timely manner.  Reference to past customers for similar services should include organization name, point of contact name and telephone number.  Capability statements will be screened using the above described capabilities to identify qualified sources.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide capability statements no later than 17 Dec 04 to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Joseph Williams, at AFOSR/PK4, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Virginia 22203-1977; or email at joseph.williams@afosr.af.mil; or fax (703) 696-6240.  For technical questions, contact the Program Manager, Dr.  Koto White, at (703) 696-7319, email: koto.white@afosr.af.mil.  Contractual questions may be addressed to Mr. Joseph Williams, at (703) 696-6208; fax (703) 696-6240, or email: joseph.williams@afosr.af.mil.  AFOSR anticipates an award date for the pending contract on or about 01 May 05, with an effective date for performance of 01 Aug 05.  This is a request for information only.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to correct the formating of the industry questions regarding the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Synopsis Solicitation No. N68335-05-R-0021.

The following is provided for informational purposes.

1.	Industry Question:  MIL-STD-810 calls out a tailoring process to define the various specifications the CVBS will need to meet throughout its service life.  Please provide a list of these environmtal specifications.

Government Response:  The environment specifications shall be as stated in the synopsis solicitation, page 3, “Under both controlled and adverse weather conditions…for both afloat and ashore activities…”  Recommend the retionale for tailoring the test parameter specifications (temperature, humidity levels, etc.) be included in your concept study


2.	 Industry Question: Other than visual technology are other technologies required in CVBS?

Government Response:  Technologies, other than visual, are not required.  However, a selection criteria element on page 4 of the synopsis solicitation is proposing “innovations outside of the outlined goals.”


3.	Industry Question: Can you provide more information on how currently deployed equipment falls short in terms of training and reliability of fault detection?

Government Response: Formal data to identify any shortfalls in training and inspection reliability is not available.    


4.	Industry Question: Are there current capabilities that are desired to be field upgrades?

Government Response: The desirable performance upgrades shall be in the concept study.


5.	Industry Question: What is the purpose of “insertion tubes still in the engine warning systems”, and is there a desired implementation NAVAIR would prefer for this feature?

Government Response: An insertion tube warning system is desired so that the borescope is not damaged if the engine is turned while the borescope is still in place.  There is NO particular implementation feature preferred, however refer to the weight, size, cost and reliability considerations.	


6.	Industry Question: Does the US Navy desire support for specific I/O connectivity to adapt for “new technology in the commercial market? (such as PC Card, USB, etc…)?

Government Response: No specific I/O connectivity features are desired.  The proposal should identify the optimum requirements based on cost and reliability. 


The proposal submission date for this requirement remains unchanged.

<DESC>USAID/Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova anticipate an award of a five-year, performance based contract to support Financial Sector/Pension System Development (FD/PSD) in Ukraine.  The procurement will be through full and open competition.   

The purpose of USAID/Ukraine's Financial Sector/Pension System Development Project (FS/PSD) is to create a viable, effective financial sector which will promote economic growth and provide a sound private pension system. 

The development of a viable, effective, financial sector will provide small and medium enterprises with access to financing to through the capital markets. In addition, USAID’s experience has demonstrated that when commercial banks realize that small and medium sized enterprises are obtaining credit through the capital markets, it can stimulate a competitive response which generates increased commercial bank lending to SMEs.

The development of a viable, effective, financial sector is also critical to the successful implementation of Ukraine’s mandatory, defined-contribution, private accumulation pension system.  This second pillar pension system which is scheduled to go into effect in January 2007 requires that all employees contribute 7% of their salaries the private accumulation pension system.  This will total a minimum of over $ 1 billion in contributions per year.  Properly invested, these funds can become a major engine of economic growth. However, Ukraine’s nascent financial sector is completely inadequate to accommodate the investment of such sums of money.  It is essential and urgent that the challenges of developing a financial market be met in order to protect the pension contributions of Ukraine’s labor force and to guarantee retirement payments to the country’s current and future pensioners.

The challenges to financial sector development in Ukraine include:

Prudential regulation and oversight, particularly in securities market and other non-bank financial markets, do not protect the public, nor stimulate the growth of financial markets.

Financial statements are not a reliable indicator of company financial performance and condition, and the public generally does not have access to accurate, understandable information on financial intermediaries

The capital markets infrastructure remains shallow, with inadequate non-bank financial institutions and instruments, insurance products, equity and debt markets, money market funds, corporate and municipal bonds.

The anticipated contributions to the Second Pillar pension system will quickly exceed domestic investment opportunities, which could result in a concentration in government securities, which will not fuel economic growth, or in sub-standard, high risk domestic corporate stocks and bonds.

Lack of progress in meeting these challenges can be attributed primarily to a lack of a modern joint-stock company law which incorporates the OECD principles of corporate governance which protect investors, and weak, inefficient financial market regulators.

To meet the challenges, the FS/PSD has set the following objectives: 

Strengthen the capacities of the financial markets regulators to provide efficient and effective prudential regulation to the NBFI sector.

Broaden the range of financial instruments available for portfolio investment.

Strengthen the capacity of the pension system to enhance the operational capabilities of the pension fund providers, regulators, supervisors, and policy makers.

USAID anticipates awarding one (1) contract, The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541611. The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov) on or around January 31, 2005. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no solicitation will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. Questions must be directed to Svetlana Podeyko at spodeyko@usaid.gov.

TITLE: Cyber Defensive & Offensive Operations Technology (CDOT)

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 03-18-IFKA

CFDA Number: n/a 

DATES:   White papers will be accepted on a continuous basis until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Dec 2008.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL/IF has asserted its leadership role and developed and transitioned products in Information Assurance R&D for a number of years.  Most recently, AFRL/IF has expanded this role to address all aspects of Network Combat Operations or Cyber Operations.  This BAA is a contracting tool directly responsive to an AFRL/IF Strategic Plan in the technical area of Cyber Operations. The technologies being pursued will provide greater functions and capabilities within the Information Warfare domain and push not only Air Force and DoD needs, but also those of National Security, Homeland Defense and Critical Infrastructure Protection. The technologies endorsed will take into full account the Air Force's move toward transformation. The technology research in the BAA will be focused in the following areas:  Covert Cyber Operations;  Threat Evaluation, Attack Recognition and Diagnosis;
Assured Infostructure Support; Wireless Information Assurance; Complex Systems.

II. General Information: The Government may, at its sole discretion, require that research results be documented in a paper suitable for publication in a national and/or international peer-reviewed journal or professional journal. 

III. Background: The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate's (AFRL/IF) has developed a responsive Information Warfare Research and Development (R&D) technology program. The objective is to meet the needs of the Air Force's Information Operations doctrine. Specifically, it is focused on Cyber Operations which includes: Information Assurance, Computer Network Defense, Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, and Computer Network Attack 

---- Information Assurance (IA) comprises those measures to protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authenticity, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.

---- Computer Network Defense is actions taken to plan and direct responses to unauthorized activity in defense of Air Force information systems and computer networks. Commanders should provide CND planning guidance to the staff, as well as supporting and subordinate commanders, as part of the "commander's intent." CND actions include analyzing network activity to determine the appropriate course of action (COA) to defend Air Force networks.

---- Computer Network Attack operations are conducted using information systems to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.
---- Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) are functions in cyberspace that result in the ability to gather information about the adversary, their intentions, and their capabilities.

IV. Objectives: The objective of this BAA is to address highly innovative R&D areas in Cyber Operations.  Proposed work should address the innovation and strategic thought of the 21st century adversary, and develop new concepts to counter with innovative information-based capabilities. Further, proposed work  should address new concepts for  continuously analyzing the information battlespace to identify US vulnerabilities and adversary weaknesses, and develop new defensive  and offensive strategies and capabilities accordingly. 

V. Research Areas: The following section describes several critical technical areas that are a focus under this BAA to receive attention. These areas are high leverage areas that must be worked in order to address the most difficult Air Force requirements, provide the Air Force with the greatest technology push possible, and surface opportunities for contributing to important national security issues such as defending information systems and countering cyber terrorism.

A.  Covert Cyber Operations.

The area of Covert Cyber Operations holds tremendous potential as a major future thrust for AFRL/IF. It is an area that can be described as allowing us access to the cyberspace domain for the purpose of adversary monitoring, intelligence gathering or information-based attack. In order to make the Covert Cyber Operations area a fully functional Air Force capability we must develop effects-based tools that allow us to plan for and achieve the desired effects of a planned cyber operation. For example, deploying effects-based tools that give decision makers lines of reasoning and their respective scenario implications would be valuable addition to the Cyber Operations and conventional warfare arsenal. This gives the decision maker a comprehensive "information set" that presents only useful information and disallows noise. Work is needed in the areas of Cyber ISR and Computer Network Attack (CNA). Cyber ISR entails developing technology for gathering information about the adversary, their intentions, and their capabilities and is necessary for identification and targeting of the adversary in cyberspace. CNA tools and systems that must be developed to penetrate an adversary's detection system and remain hidden until triggered. Cyber Operations interest areas include access, targeting, mission planning, attack effectiveness measures, attack damage assessment, and CNA tool development. 

B. Threat Evaluation, Attack Recognition and Diagnosis.

The threat evaluation, attack recognition and diagnosis area is one that will be of critical importance in the future for not only the Air Force, but also DoD and U.S. critical infrastructures. As discussed above, the Air Force and DoD are building information systems and networks and offering "information services that rely on more complex and larger-scale information networks each year (and more recently, wireless and high speed). It is apparent that it is extremely difficult if not impossible to prevent all attacks against such systems. The ability to recognize attacks, evaluate the threat and diagnose the salient aspects of such attacks becomes a critical issue. New R&D is needed to address aspects of early warning. Early recognition of an adversary information warfare attack means that we must have technology in place that can look across both time and space looking for events that may seem insignificant in isolation but taken together could be laying the foundation for a large-scale attack, such as distributed denial of service. In addition to improving intrusion detection capabilities, tools need to be developed that address correlation and fusion of cyberspace attack indicators. Work also needs to continue in the area of cyberspace visualization and situation awareness to better assist the overloaded operator in attack recognition and diagnosis. Another area of critical importance is cyber forensics and attack assessment. Computer forensics is an area most commonly associated with law enforcement. The R&D proposed in this BAA addresses the gathering of digital evidence for the purpose of "just-in-time" attack assessment in a complex network environment. The need to gather digital evidence in the military information environment is critical as the commander needs accurate, verifiable evidence of who is attacking, what techniques they are using, and where the attacker is located. In addition, accurate digital evidence drives the response whether it is defensive or offensive. Finally, an area of particular importance in the area of threat evaluation, attack recognition and diagnosis concerns the insider threat. The insider threat is one of the most insidious threats facing the implementation and full realization of Network-Centric Warfare technologies. First, a lack of fine-grained security controls on the inside may mean that a malicious insider could gain access to information above their classification level or not within their need-to-know profile. Adding to this, a lack of sufficiently fine-grained auditing tools would make it difficult if not impossible to accurately determine if someone or a group of collaborators are violating the information assurance policy. 

C. Assured Infostructure Support.  The Air Force is an information intensive organization that relies upon a complex, interconnected collection of networks and information systems to carry out its mission. These networks and information systems must have a strong defense against the myriad of threats that we face today and will increase in capability in the future. Since greater attention is being given to resolve operational stovepipes and the need for better systems integration, multi-level security (MLS) and secure mobile code continue to be critical technical areas. Technology is also needed to integrate and reason about both network management and intrusion detection data. Related to the fault tolerance concept and drawing from that discipline is the area of intrusion tolerance. Intrusion tolerance is emerging as one of the most important R&D areas in Cyber Operations today since the systems and networks we depend upon must continue to operate through intrusions and keep operating, albeit in a degraded mode, in spite of a successful adversary information warfare attack. 

D. Wireless Information Assurance.  A key piece of the large-scale information enterprise is the wireless information assurance segment. Wireless networks must exhibit the same functional and IA attributes as wired networks. They must be protected, attacks against these networks must be detected, specifics of successful attacks must be assessed and finally appropriate responses must be carried out. As we move to more and more wireless components becoming a part of the larger network and as wireless networks proliferate we need to be aware that these networks, if improperly understood and configured, could provide a "back-door" into our protected wired enterprise. Intrusion detection for wireless networks must be addressed as well as recovery of wireless services after adversary disruption/denial destruction of friendly networks. Software Defined Radio (SDR) and distributed boundary control technology is needed to allow flexibility in operations and enhanced assured operations.

E. Complex Systems.  New techniques are needed to that help system engineers to state and reason about the complex relationships of all of the IA products within an organizations information enterprise. An improperly utilized tool, technique or product could invalidate the IA posture of a whole organization. Metrics are needed and an obvious place to start when developing IA metrics is to examine the properties of confidentiality, availability and integrity. A focus for future designs is Biologically Inspired Cyber Operations area. It is an area that holds promise for protection of the enterprise, detection of attacks, response to successful attacks, and even carrying out computer network attacks against an adversary. With the increase of size, interconnectivity, and number of points of access, computer networks have become vulnerable to various forms of information attacks, especially to new sophisticated ones. Biological organisms are also complex and interconnected systems that have many points of access and are vulnerable to sabotage by alien microorganisms. In fact, biological organisms have developed a very successful immune system for detecting, identifying, and destroying most alien intruders.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is seeking sources with the knowledge, skills, and capabilities to assist the Natural Resources Office's Restoration Group in determining the following:  1) the feasibility of using seed alone to produce large scale restoration sites composed of dense patches of cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and willow (Salix gooddingii and S. exigua), interspersed with native groundcovers and shrubs, and 2) irrigation methods necessary to produce this type of habitat.  Feasibility must include methods that can be undertaken on the lower Colorado River between Needles, California and Yuma, Arizona. The purpose in growing these species in high density is to shade out saltcedar (Tamarisk spp.) while providing habitat composed of native vegetation with high genetic diversity.  A draft statement of work is available upon request to interested parties for review and comment. Entities (consulting firms, universities, non-profit groups) interested in possibly participating in such a procurement are invited to submit a response to this notice. Responses should clearly state the name, address, telephone, and fax numbers and e-mail addresses of the parties to be involved in the project. The entities' knowledge, skills, and experience that would make them qualified and capable of accomplishing the above requirement should be addressed thoroughly in the form of a resume and/or curriculum vitae.   The resume should include a list of similar past projects and the magnitude and dollar amount of each project and should specifically state the qualifications of each team member that worked on the project. Inclusion of the estimated time required to accomplish these projects would also be helpful.  Information received through this notice may be utilized by the Government and does not constitute a request for proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Also include information regarding your small business status, e.g. 8(a) program, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, service disabled veteran, Hubzone, etc. Requests for the draft statement of work and resume with a list of similar past projects, may be submitted by e-mail to Barbara Raulston at BRaulston@lc.usbr.gov or by fax at 702-293-8418.  The resumes and list of similar past projects should be provided no later than February 1, 2005, to Barbara Raulston at the same e-mail and fax as stated above.

Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), Net-Centric Services Branch, P.O. Box 25857, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406.
Description
This is an announcement to notify interested vendors that DITCO-Scott will be holding a presentation to disseminate information regarding two future managed services requirements for DISA, Computing Services (CS).  The requirement is to obtain reliable, responsive, and cost effective server and storage infrastructure capabilities which are dynamically scalable utilizing an on-demand service approach that will readily adjust to changes in processing and throughput requirements, both increases and decreases, and is priced on a utility (“as used”) basis.  

The infrastructure provided shall be designed, delivered, installed, and administered in concert with the Government, at any of the 16 DISA CS data centers in the continental US (CONUS), the DISA CS data centers in Hawaii and Europe, and other locations worldwide in which DISA CS has an operational responsibility.  

Additionally the requirement must provide processing environments that support the current (and last previous) DISA-approved version/release of HP-UX, Sun Solaris, AIX, Windows, Red Hat, and SUSE Linux.

As a provider of information technology solutions for the Department of Defense (DoD), DISA’s customers require server and storage capacity services for a variety of application and processing environments.  DISA CS must have the ability to provide server and storage solutions in a timely manner whenever and wherever the requirements occur.  This initiative is to provide state-of-the-art server and storage solutions to meet new and emerging customer requirements and provide solutions to replace existing DISA capacity that has exceeded its technical or economic life as determined by the Government.   

The informational presentation will be held on 26 January 2004 at 1:00 P.M. CST, at the Base Theater located at Scott AFB, IL.  The purpose of this presentation is twofold, with one being for the Government to determine vendor interest for soliciting via open market versus via GSA Schedule.  The other purpose is to provide a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) to the attending vendors.  The vendors will have two weeks to offer any written suggestions to the government regarding the draft SOO.
   
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS PRESENTATION OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS MEETING.  This presentation will be held to issue information and for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to the draft SOO that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Responses to the draft SOO will not be returned.  Whatever information is provided in response to this draft SOO will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

It is anticipated that any solicitation resulting from this draft SOO will be issued as a full and open competition with the Government reserving its right in the future to go via GSA Schedule if feasible.  Projected schedule for any solicitation/award resulting from this RFI is as follows:     
-	
-	Reservations of attendance by vendors to the information briefing must be received no later than: 30 December 2004
-	Informational presentation: 26 January 2005
-	Acceptance of input by vendors to draft SOO: due no later than 07 February 2005
-	Release Request for Proposal:  28 February 2005
 
Reservations to attend the informational presentation are due by 30 December 2004 (attendance is limited to two people per company) and shall be sent electronically to maryann.hall@disa.mil.     

The Government may request additional information or discuss information received in responses to the draft SOO with individual responders.  

All questions concerning this RFI shall be directed to Mary Ann Hall, 618-229-9580 or Anne Hellman, 618-229-9596.

<DESC>As part of it’s Market Research, PM Force Protection Systems of the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) and is seeking information and sample hardware concerning Commercial/Non-Developmental Man-packed Forward Looking Infrared Imagers  (FLIR) that will detect, identify, or provide early warning of possible threats. Marines currently employ several types of night vision devices designed for driving, target engagement, and other tactical operations.  PM Force Protection is seeking other available non-developmental item (NDI) solutions from industry, specifically man-packed FLIRs. The FLIRs sought for evaluation shall be high performance handheld or weapon mounted devices.  The program will seek new and existing technologies intended to detect personnel out to and beyond the effective range of infantry squad weapons.  The FLIR will be used while performing common combat missions such as movement to contact, hasty defense, or other tactical engagements.  Marines will use the FLIRs to detect threats at standoff ranges that will allow a squad to prepare for, counter, or prevent enemy confrontation.  The FLIRs shall be fully capable of being stored and operated in a range of weather and temperature extremes (desert to arctic) and rugged enough to withstand being externally carried in small carrying cases by Marines during the rigors of performing individual movement techniques or moving through an urban environment in combat/threatening conditions. 
MARCORSYSCOM is currently interested in assessing two configurations of man-packed FLIRS: (1) lightweight thermal weapon sight for small arms with the ability to recognize targets at 300-500m and the ability to detect targets at 800m+ and (2) thermal observation binoculars (either in a binocular package or a ‘camcorder’ package), capable of detecting targets at ranges of 5-8 km and beyond. MCSC requests that interested parties provide the following for either or both desired configurations at no cost to the Government: 1. fully operational system sample for limited lab and user evaluation. No intentional environmental testing or other destructive testing will be performed. 2. Sales / marketing literature applicable to the device.  3. Performance specifications of the system. 4. Any environmental data related to MIL-STD 810 testing or qualification.  5. Description and data of any previous government test/evaluation.  6.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division is responsible for acquisition, fielding and life cycle support of Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training systems suitable for effective training.  Life cycle support includes ensuring the availability of an initial material support package at time of device fielding and the acquisition of spare and repair parts attributable to device modifications and upgrades.  These Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training systems spare and repair parts are the focus of this pre-solicitation notice.  NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends on negotiating and awarding several spare and repair parts buys on a sole source basis from 1 January 2005 through 31 December 2005.  The total estimated amount of these purchases is expected to approach $10 million.  The Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training system platforms and major subsystems to which this synopsis applies are annotated in Attachment (A).  Furthermore, the sole source original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of spare and repair parts within these subsystems are enumerated within Attachment (B).  Attachments (A) and (B) may be found at the NAVAIR Orlando Business Opportunities web site at.  http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=NAWCTSD
Once linked to the web site you must change ENTRY TYPES to “All”.  The attachments will be located under the heading “Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Training Systems Spare and Repair Parts”.  While this synopsis serves as a pre-solicitation notice of the sole source acquisitions for spare and repair parts from the OEMs listed in Attachment (B), it is not intended to preclude the Government from acquiring spare and repair parts through the training system design/build contractor as this strategy may serve the Government’s best interest.  See numbered note 22, which is modified as follows.  The proposed contract actions are for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only the Attachment (B) sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties not identified within Attachment (B) are encouraged to express their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Responses to this notice shall be received NLT 30 December 2004.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents should be added to the Attachment (B) pool of sole source OEMs.  In those situations where the Government determines that identical parts are available from more than one OEM, it will compete these acquisitions among the OEMs.  A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Sandra Hughes, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 432-4108, Fax (703) 432-3543, Email hughessk@mcsc.usmc.mil
<DESC>The Marine Corps System Command (MCSC) is conducting a market survey to determine industries capabilities to fabricate and integrate the Team Portable Collection System Multi-Platform Capable (TPCS-MPC) system Team and Ground Platform Integration Kits (PIKs).  These efforts will include procurement, fabrication, integration, factory testing, and delivery of 48 TPCS-MPC systems.  One TPCS-MPC system includes the Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) electronics suite of equipment, one Ground Platform Integration Kit (PIK), and one Control Station (CS).  This effort will be a “built-to-drawing specifications” effort in accordance with a Government provided product Level II engineering drawing package.  The primary development efforts will include the fabrication of the PIKs, system cables, and equipment enclosures.  Integration will focus on the installation and factory acceptance testing of the electronics suites.
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
The TPCS-MPC will provide the next evolutionary enhancement to the TPCS signals exploitation components and provide a multi-platform functionality for Marine Corps SIGINT operations.  The TPCS-MPC program leverages past TPCS core development efforts, and other service tactical SIGINT system efforts as well as leading edge commercial-off-the-shelf/government-off-the-shelf/non-developmental item (COTS/GOTS/NDI) SIGINT technology insertion.  The TPCS-MPC production effort will not be a “new system development” effort, but rather a systems integration process with primary focus on rapid procurement of readily available COTS/GOTS/NDI technologies and plug-and-play capabilities requiring limited integration to allow rapid production and fielding.  The TPCS-MPC will be the medium element of the full and evolving assortment of tactical SIGINT equipment encompassed by the Marine Corps Family of SIGINT Systems (FOSS) for Light, Medium, and Heavy SIGINT/EW Operational Concepts.
SIGINT SUITE:
The SIGINT suite component of the TPCS-MPC encompasses those elements of the electronics suite that can be “team transportable” and operable at a stationary site.  The electronics suite of equipment is installed into the Ground PIK.  The SIGINT suite includes equipment enclosures, special purpose SIGINT receivers, scanners, laptop computers, antennas, a telescoping mast, a generator, and all necessary interconnecting cables. The contractor shall deliver 48 SIGINT suites.
CONTROL STATION:
The CS is comprised of electronics suite components and associated equipment enclosure.  The CS is a stationary element of the system, which functions as the SIGINT collection management and analysis node.  The CS also performs communications and data connectivity to other supported USMC systems.  The electronic components in the CS are comprised of a subset of the SIGINT suite. The contractor shall deliver 48 CS.
GROUND PIK:
The Ground PIK component of the TPCS-MPC encompasses those ancillary hardware components to facilitate installation of the SIGINT suite onto an organic, non-dedicated High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  The PIK provides for the secure installation of the SIGINT components in a rack-mounted configuration into the HMMWV.  The Ground PIK includes a COTS hardtop shelter and external antenna mounting platforms for the HMMWV.  The PIK also provides a power interface with the vehicle’s electrical power source. The contractor shall deliver 48 Ground PIKs. 

Interested firms are requested to submit a capability statement outlining their ability to meet or exceed this potential requirement. Interested sources should send all capability statements by October 27, 2004 to: Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: PG-12, Intel (Sandra Hughes), 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134.  NO submissions via e-mail will be accepted.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

Description
SAIC Frederick Inc. intends to award Translational Genomics Research Institute a contract in support of The Biomarker in Multiple Sclerosis Study (BIO-MS) sponsored through NINDS. This study will be performed as anancillary study to a double-blind, multicenter (77 centers) combination treatment trial in MS patients. The trial will study 1000 patients over three years. Patients will be randomized after a baseline visit into treatment arms with interferon-beta (Avonex®), glatiramer-acetate (Copaxone®)(both approved therapies in MS; 250 patients in each arm) or the combination of the two drugs (500 patients). The Bio-MS study will address a number of questions that are related to identifying biomarkers that reflect the complex disease pathogenesis and clinical heterogeneity in MS patients, and also the treatment responsiveness or non-responsiveness. The main aspects of the intended award are: 1. Single nucleotide polymorphism polymorphism mapping with the largest available SNP platform (all 1000 patients; one examination); performed at TGen, Arizona 2. Gene expression profiling with the Affymetrix 133-Plus microarray platform (all 1000 patients, 4 time points); TGen, Arizona 3. Protein expression profiling by a combination of SELDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS (1000 patients, 4 examinations); performed at SAIC, Frederick 4. HLA-typing (class I and class II) (1000 patients, one examination); performed at the Department of Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center, NIH 5. Storage of samples for additional studies on autoantibodies or other components. Performed at SAIC, Frederick; aliquoting of samples into multiple tubes necessary. 6. Data analysis of biomarker studies and linking with clinical and MRI data from the combination therapy trial (Combi-Rx). Performed by the IT Branch, NINDS, NIH. Notes: SAIC to handle Proteomics 1. SNP Genotyping SNP genotyping by internationally recognized field leaders (development site and/or center of excellence preferred) is required for a single 1,000 baseline clinical trial sample set. The platform of choice is the Affymetrix GeneChip® Mapping 100K Set. Samples will be provided from a repository facility, in accordance with the clinical trial schedule. The work scope is to include DNA isolation through to capture and analysis of data from the hybridized array chips using standard techniques. 2. Gene Expression Microarrays Gene expression profiling by internationally recognized field leaders (development site and/or center of excellence preferred) is required for a 1,000 baseline clinical sample set and two 1,000 sample time points at six months and one year. Appropriately stabilized samples will be provided from a repository facility in accordance with the clinical trial schedule. The work scope is to include RNA isolation through to capture and analyzed data from the hybridized array chips using standard techniques. 3. Data Processing/Interpretation a. Database Design The selected vendor should have extensive experience designing databases and processes for significant clinical trials with a genotyping component. The vendor should have worked with hospitals and other organizations involved with clinical trial data to ensure secure storage and transfer of confidential information. b. Microarray Data Management The selected vendor should have demonstrated industry leading storage and analysis capabilities for microarray experiments including gene expression and SNP genotyping. Expertise with automated methods that can re-annotate expression and microarray chips by integrating data from OMIM, LocusLink, dbSNP, TIGR’s Resourcerer System, and Vendor-annotations are required. c. Data Analysis The ability to integrate SNP and expression data is required. Any algorithms developed for such data integration should have been published and have demonstrated utility in the biomedical research community, particularly those members involved with clinical trials. For this purpose, the selected vendor will posses some or all of the following mathematical tools: small feature classifiers; biological context mining; discriminant predictors; multivariate clustering; coefficient of determination; correlation classification of SNP data; and genotyping methods including standard LOD, LD, and LOH analyses; advanced susceptibility analyses. Access to a highly parallel supercomputer for performing combinatorial and iterative calculations in a reasonable time frame is also required. d. Database Management The selected vendor’s analytical approach should include a federated biomedical database system that provides a local instance of relational databases for microarray expression, SNP, clinical, epidemiology, and others. This federation should use a metathesaurus like that of the NCI (http://ncimeta.nci.nih.gov/indexMetaphrase.html) to ensure consistency in biological and medical terms, and to provide a robust and cross-discipline database system. Ideally the selected vendor should be involved in or at least follow the NCI caBIG initiative, and when applicable adopt the standards being developed there.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<CONTACT>Steve Paschke, Business Specialist, Phone 208-526-1113, Fax 208-526-0876, Email sdp@inel.gov
<DESC>The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory has developed a novel plasma powder that produces ammonia when reacted with water at room temperatures.  Production of ammonia from the powder stops immediately when the water is cut off.  Hydrolysis of the powders to produce ammonia also liberates a significant amount of heat.  The spent powder could be converted back to the starting material by a plasma treatment process.  The novel powder is stable, easily transportable and is not hazardous.  The powder is ideal for ammonia or hydrogen (by decomposition of the ammonia) production on demand at end-user locations.  This material is a safe alternative to transporting hazardous anhydrous ammonia or urea across the nation. 
The technology has not been fully developed.  Particularly, the plasma re-conversion process for the spent material needs to be developed.   The INEEL is soliciting funding from qualified companies to support a development program to validate and test the proprietary process.  The development period for this project is expected to last 24-36 months.  At the conclusion of the development project, the firm may seek up to an exclusive field of use license for intellectual property related to the project.  This solicitation of interest will close on February 28, 2004.
