<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<DESC>This notice is being posted in compliance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(2), within 14 days after placing an order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold supported by a limited-source justification. On June 27, 2013, The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases issued a delivery/task order to Open Text, Inc. under HHSN272201300218U against Open Text's GSA Contract Number GS35F0480J. This order was issued under the authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized for the justification stated below:
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID], Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology [OCICB] requires Open Text's MBPM (formerly Metastorm BPM) software and software maintenance to add additional functionality with the Institute's Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS) infrastructure.  The maintenance period of performance is 12 months.</p>
<p>This acquisition, in support of the NIAID EDRMS project, integrates a high volume workflow and form module with NIAID's Content Server (LiveLink) and SharePoint (collab, e-collab) systems. OpenText's MBPM software is proprietary and not available through resellers. The EDRMS team requested MBPM software licenses for standard users, servers, and designers. The MBPM software will be used to develop electronic forms and workflows in conjunction with other EDRMS solutions.</p>
<p>NIAID's OCICB currently utilizes Open Text's Content Server (LiveLink) software to support the EDRMS initiative. The MBPM licenses sought as part of this purchase request are an enhancement to the existing electronic forms and workflow capabilities present in Content Server. Content Server's workflow and forms capabilities are focused on document-centric processes, e.g. create, review, approve, and publish. EDRMS is frequently being called on to develop inter-system integrations which result in documents being stored in Content Server. For example, creating a workflow for onboarding new staff requires receiving data from multiple databases and ultimately storing documents in a repository. MBPM is uniquely suited to these kinds of integrations due to its deep integration with Content Server. MBPM comes "out of the box" with a connector for retrieving and storing documents and meta data in Content Server. MBPM also shares an authentication and authorization system with Content Server (Open Text Directory Services - OTDS), which greatly simplifies development. The MBPM software and Content Server are uniformly supported by Open Text Corporation, ensuring continuity of service and proper maintenance for the life of the EDRMS program. Open Text Corporation is the only available source that meets the requirements of this acquisition.</p>
