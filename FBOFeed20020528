The detector must cool down and be operational within one hour from ambient temperature.  System shall be provided with a sinle keyboard/mouse mode of operation for the SEM-EDS. (5) Sample chamber accommodates samples as large as 12 inches in diameter and 3 inches high weighing up to 3 kg.  Eucentric tilt stage maintains focus, mag and field of view at all WD positions.  Stage travel sufficient to observe a 7 inches diameter sample when combining rotation with X-Y translation (e.g.X=125mm,Y=100mm).  Other travel at least 80mm in Z, -10 to 90 degrees of tilt, 360-degree rotation.  Motorized, computer controlled mouse, or joystick, drives travel for all axes  (X,Y,Z,T,R). Stage speed shall be proportional to, and linked to, magnification.  Graphical display of sample stage, showing position of beam on sample and relative position of sample to final lens.  Store and recall at least 2000 stored stage coordinates with the operating conditions (e.g., mag, focus, astigmatism, vacuum mode) and automatically position stage to the intersection of cross hairs set by the operator on the display, or to any point in the X, Y, Z, T, R plane either individually or simultaneously.   Able to tilt an 8 inches sample up to 45 degrees at a WD as short as 10mm and up to 60 degrees at 20mm.  Minimum take-off-angle of 35 degrees, for an EDS detector, with the sample surface perpendicular to the incident beam at a WD of 10mm or less.  Sample tilt in the direction of the EDS detector to provide maximum count rates for irregularly shaped samples.  The sample stage shall be internal, separate from the SEM door, allowing users to place any given sample directly on the stage, observing its proximity to all detectors prior to closing the door for evacuation. (6) Electron optics with a cartridge-type wehnelt assembly, auto filament saturation, and auto gun alignment-automatic or manual. Electromagnetic beam blanking at operator discretion.   Two-stage zoom Condenser Lens (CL) to permit changes in probe current, and/or kV, without the need to change focus, spot position or stigmation.  Externally selectable and adjustable Objective Lens (OL) aperture.At least three different aperture diameters to optimize image resolution, depth of focus, and maintain the optimum spot size as the beam current is varied.  Capability to add an automated Faraday cup in the column just below the objective lens aperture to accurately measure the true probe current. Dynamic focus capability, linked to mag and WD, for sample tilts of up to 85 degrees. Auto and manual control for focus and OL stigmation.  A wobbler to facilitate optimum centering of OL aperture.  A sharply conical OL, permitting high tilt of large diameter samples at a short WD.   A selection of at least six fixed magnifications that can be instantly utilized from any point in the mag range. (7) Conventional E-T type secondary electron detector, a low vacuum secondary electron detector and a solid state BEI mounted to not restrict any of the sample movement specified above. BEI must permit separation of signal to show pure compositional or topographical image. The ratio of compo to topo signal must be electronically variable. Detector shall allow variable shadow-contrast to enhance topographical features. Location of the BEI must not hinder high resolution SE imaging or limit EDS or any other imaging mode. (8) Vacuum system with a turbomolecular pump rated at least 250 liters/sec, air cooled, and two rotary pumps (RP) rated for at least 100 liters/min.  The turbomolecular pump shall be dedicated to evacuation of the SEM in the high vacuum mode of operation and one rotoary pump must be dedicated to the sample chamber for operation in the differentially pumped low vacuum mode. The second rotory pump to improve overall pump down speed.  The first rotory pump is fitted with a coaxial foreline trap that is bakeable using an operator-controlled timer.  The differential pumping aperture for the column shall be totally separated from the OL aperture so as to allow fine adjustment during low vacuum operation.  Fully automated sequencing.  Minimum vacuum allowed in LV mode no less than 1Pa from the RP.  Water is not required for system. (9) Operating system has keypad, mouse and joystick, with menu selection by either mouse or keypad; mouse control of focus, mag, astigmatism, image shift and stage; and graphical user interface.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), through the Program Support Center (PSC) intends to award a sole source simplified acquisition to William M. Mercer, Inc. A critical aspect of the SAMHSA agenda, and of the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) and Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), is to provide leadership in understanding and evaluating the organization and financing of service systems for persons with mental illness and substance abuse disorder. As States move toward the implementation of various strategies that seek to optimize the value of provided services by controlling their cost and utilization (managed care models), they have found that the knowledge base for estimating capitation rates and risk adjustment is inadequate, especially for the disabled and other vulnerable populations.  Policy makers require good information on the organization and scope of benefit packages, costs and cost sharing, utilization of services, and benefit limits, as well as information comparing the mental health benefit with general health care coverage, in order to assess the budgetary and other consequences of policy options. The collection and consolidation of information on managed mental health and substance abuse care is therefore an area of great importance, and CMHS/CSAT are engaged in a variety of activities to explore these issues. The CMHS/CSAT Offices of Managed Care (OMC) serves as the Centers' leads in this area, conducting a variety of data collection and analysis, cost estimation, services evaluation, cost-effectiveness analysis, policy assessment, and technical assistance activities.  The Offices of Managed Care also handle projects and activities assigned to CMHS and CSAT under the SAMHSA Managed Care Initiative, and coordinate managed care activities within their Centers.  The Offices of Managed Care are particularly interested in learning more about the coverage and provision of mental health and substance abuse services in the private sector and by employers. This project shall continue a data collection effort which the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) and the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) have conducted for the past several years, providing an overview and analysis of the MH/SA benefits provided through employer health plans. Since 1995, CMHS/CSAT have sponsored analyses of data collected by Mercer/Foster Higgins, through their annual National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans. These analyses have included information regarding:  the organization of the MH/SA benefit plans, i.e., carve-in and carve out models; specific types of MH/SA services included in benefit plans; scope of the benefits; benefit limits for MH/SA services; beneficiary cost sharing for MH services; per capita cost of MH/SA services; and statistics comparing the MH/SA benefit with general health care coverage.  This proposed requirement for which the Government intends to solicit only one source is under the authority of of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the required services. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation is available; therefore, requests for such document will be considered invalid responses.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received, the Contracting Officer will proceed to issue a purchase order to William M. Mercer, Inc. This firm is uniquely qualified for this requirement due to their proprietary databases containing information from the Mercer National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans which has become the industry standard.  Responses must be in writing and refer to 02M009248 to the attention of Marisha Foreman.  See Note 22.

This acquisition is a competitive 8(a) set-aside procurement under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 562910, Environmental Remediation Services.

The resulting contract will be a FIRM FIXED PRICE, INDEFINITE DELIVERY, INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ), FOR VARIOUS ENGINEERING STUDIES AND RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SERVICES at HUNTERS POINT SHIPYARD, San Francisco, CA.  Awards will be made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 competitive negotiation procedures.  Contracts will be awarded to the 8(a) firm whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, offers the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The contract will be awarded for a base period of one year with two (2) one-year option periods. The Government has the right to exercise the option years.  The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.  These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.  The Government intends to award the contract with Proposed Task Order 0001.  However, the government reserves the right not to award Proposed Task Order 0001.  The minimum guarantee is $50,000.  The total aggregate value of task orders under this contract shall not exceed $25,000,000.    The services required are to perform but not limited to the following services:  preliminary assessment, site inspection, testing, remedial investigation, environmental engineering studies, investigations, field sampling, laboratory analysis, electronic data management, feasibility studies, remedial design, containment, remedial action, temporary storage and removal of contaminated materials, preparation of reports and other related environmental remediation services.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors: FACTOR-1 Past Performance within the last three years; FACTOR-2 Specialized Experience within the last five years; FACTOR-3 Engineering and Management Approach (This factor will include Proposed Task Order 0001); FACTOR-4 Compliance with Public Law 103.337 which authorizes the Secretary of Defense to give preference to entities that plan to hire local residents when entering into contracts for services to be performed at a military installation that is affected by closure or alignment under a base closure law; and FACTOR-5 Price (Price of Proposed Task Order 0001). Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 are of equal importance.  Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 combined are significantly more important than Factor 5.   The Government reserves the right: to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award a contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest price for Proposed Task Order 0001; to limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals, and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal, determined by the Government, to be most advantageous to the Government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS; therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Offerors shall not assume that they would be contacted or afforded the opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command's (USASMDCs) Directed Energy Technology Program Office has a requirement to conduct Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL) Concept and Technology Development (CTD) in conjunction with ongoing THEL Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) testing (which will provide a basis for MTHEL design validation decisions). The MTHEL CTD activities are a follow-on to the development test and evaluation (DT&E) of the THEL Demonstrator. The THEL Demonstrator is a one-of-a-kind system developed by TRW, Incorporated, under a US/Israeli cooperative research program pursued as an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program. Pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), USASMDC plans to award a modification to the existing THEL ACTD contract on a sole source basis to TRW, Incorporated, of Redondo Beach, California. The proposed MTHEL CTD effort will investigate design trades that could allow a follow-on development to the THEL ACTD Demonstrator on a truck-mounted system with performance similar to that of the THEL ACTD Demonstrator. In parallel under the existing contract, TRW will conduct synergistic testing that will be designed to benefit decision makers by aiding the design trade process for MTHEL. This is the next step in a phased program to evaluate the effectiveness of a THEL in negating the threat poised by Katyusha and other short-range artillery rocke ts. These efforts are integral to and are so closely intertwined with the development of the Demonstrator to date as to be essentially non-severable. These efforts build on the prior work of TRW and it has been determined that award to any other source wou ld result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered by competition. This effort will be awarded as soon as possible and performed prior to the end of FY2002. A SECRET facility clearance is required for this effort.  Written responses must cite this notice and be submitted to the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN: SMDC-CM-AK/Mr. O. Wayne Koger, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801.

<DESC>The Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the 14 National Centers of Excellence (CoE) in Womens Health to extend the 4 CoE contracts awarded in fiscal year 1996 (1st generation) for 3 additional 1-year option period and to extend the 4 CoE contracts awarded in fiscal year 1997 (2nd generation) and the 5 CoE contracts awarded in fiscal year 1998 (3rd generation) for 4 additional 1-year option periods.  The contract numbers and the contractors for the 14 CoEs are: 282-96-0034, Magee-Womens Hospital; 282-96-0035, MCP Hahnemann University; 282-96-0036, University of Pennsylvania; 282-96-0039, University of California at San Francisco; 282-97-0025, University of California at Los Angeles; 282-97-0071, University of Michigan; 282-97-0074, Boston University; 282-97-0075, Indiana University; 213-98-0009, Harvard University; 213-98-0014, University of Illinois at Chicago; 213-98-0015, Tulane University; 213-98-0016, University of Washington at Seattle; 213-98-0017, University of Wisconsin at Madison; and 213-98-0018, University of Puerto Rico.  The National Centers of Excellence in Womens Health contracts were designed to fill a critical need for the provision of state-of-the-art, comprehensive, culturally and linguistically appropriate, and integrated health care services targeted to the special needs of women, for the development of a multi-disciplinary research agenda on womens health issues, and for enhanced public and health care professional education on womens health issues.  These additional options periods will continue to develop and evaluate comprehensive national model program(s), which focus on womens unique needs in the health care delivery system by providing both educational and clinical services to women, and development of multi-disciplinary research program on womens health linking speciality areas, while reducing the Government funding for the Centers of Excellence. In an effort to make the CoEs self sustaining, CoE funding from OWH will be tapered over the 3 or 4 additional options periods, so that within 4 years for the 1st generation CoEs and 5 years for the 2nd and 3rd generation CoEs, the CoEs will be self sustaining.   These additional option periods have been justified in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(d).  This is not a request for proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate, on a noncompetitive basis, with Maryland Medical Research Institute, 600 Wyndhurst Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21210-2425; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709; University of Texas, 1200 Herman Pressler Drive, School of Public Health, Houston, Texas 77030; Columbia University, 2960 Broadway, New York, New York 10027-6902; University of Washington, 1107 NE 45th Street, Seattle, Washington 98105; Johns Hopkins University, 615 North Wolfe Street, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205-2179; University of North Carolina, 137 E Franklin Street, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27514-4145; and University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, School of Public Health, 2221University Avenue, SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55414-3080, to reformat data sets received from completed clinical trials.  Through competitive procedures contracts were negotiated to perform clinical trials for various research initiatives.  Upon completion of those clinical trials data sets were delivered which compiled research data for use by other researchers in their own research investigations.  Due to recent concerns about maintaining the confidentiality of patient data compiled as a result of in NHLBI's clinical trials, the data sets are to be modified to allow use of the data without inadvertently unveiling patient identities.  The initial research institutions possess a unique familiarity with the clinical studies, and will be able to reformat the data sets systematically removing personal patient identifying information in a short period of time.  In order for NHLBI to meet the confidentiality requirements and to make the data sets available to the research investigators in a timely manner, an award to any other source for this requirement would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Background Information: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has supported collection of data from participants in numerous clinical trials and epidemiologic studies.  These well-characterized population samples represent rare and valuable scientific resources.  In order to take full advantage of such resources and maximize their research value, it is important that data collected with public funds be made available, under appropriate terms and conditions, to the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner.  Under contract-supported studies, a limited access data set is required as a contract deliverable to the NHLBI.  In selected circumstances, such data sets also may be required of studies supported by cooperative agreements or grants.  In preparing data sets for release the subject identifiers are removed.  Variables that might lead to the identification of subjects, such as outliers, dates, and study site in the case of multi-center studies,  are removed or collapsed into larger cells. Nevertheless, given enough information about an individual subject, coupled with publically available data, it may be possible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity of a particular subject.  Therefore, the data are not truly  "anonymized" and are only provided to investigators agreeing to adhere to established policies for distribution.  Recently we have become aware that the data sets  received before 2000 do not protect subject confidentiality to the extent we require under current NHLBI policy.  Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement:  The purpose of this acquisition is to reformat the data sets from a selection of  previously conducted clinical trials to meet current confidentiality and documentation requirements.  Period of Performance: The period of performance is from three (3) to twelve (12) months from the date of award, depending on the size and complexity of the data set.  This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6, Competition Requirements.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541710.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.  Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PS-2002-082, may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Rockledge Building 2, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902,  Attention: Debra Hawkins .  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.

This requirement is NOT being procured as a commercial purchase.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for the Small Business Concerns.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 235940. The Small Business Size Standard is $12,000,000.00.  The Public Works Center, Washington, DC, Planning and Programming Division has tasked the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, East Coast Detachment (NFESC ECDET) with the demolition of Pier 5 at the Washington Navy Yard (WNY), Washington, DC.  Pier 5 is located adjacent to Bulkhead 598, between Pier 4 and the west property line at the WNY. The pier is operated by WNY Port Operations but is currently closed due to the poor condition of the deck.  Pier 5, originally built in 1942, is 240 feet long by 36 feet wide and extends to the southwest from the shore.  The superstructure consists of a timber plank deck supported by 25 primary pile bents, and alternating helper bents located beneath a single pair of railroad tracks.  The primary bents consist of double 4-inch by 12-inch members spanning the width of the pier.  The helper bents consist of 12-inch by 12-inch beams spanning the area immediately beneath the railroad tracks.  The superstructure is supported on 179 vertical timber piles and 23 batter piles, each of 12-inch diameter.  Additionally, 55 fender piles occupy the perimeter of the pier.  The pier mooring hardware consists of eight cleats and five bitts.  Electrical panels, lights, and outlets at the pier have been removed.  The utility conduits have been abandoned but are still attached to the underside of the pier.  The Contractor shall obtain all necessary permits and furnish all personnel, equipment, and materials necessary to complete mobilization, pier demolition, and debris disposal.  Environmental concerns require the piles to be cut off at a point approximately one foot above the existing river bottom using a hydraulic cutter.  Disturbance of the bottom sediments must be kept at an absolute minimum; as such, diver-operated equipment will not be allowed.  The Contractor will be required to deploy a turbidity curtain around the immediate work area that extends vertically in the water column to make full contact with the river bottom.  Work must be done in a manner that minimizes disruption to production schedule.  Performance should start 14 days after contract award.  All responsible offers, received on time, may be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be posted at the following Internet address http://esolnavfac.navy.mil on or about 29 May 2002.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price Order under NAVAIR Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Number N00019-00-G-0425 with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, South Oyster Bay Road, Bethpage, New York 11714.  This order requires a conceptual study of alternate engines for the E-2C aircraft, with NP2000 propellers, to assess the potential life cycle cost benefits of alternate engine candidates for both new production (Radar Modernization Program) and existing T56-A-427 powered E-2C aircraft.  Northrop Grumman intends to solicit interested engine manufacturers with viable candidate engines to provide technical, financial and nominal schedule data to support this study.  Only NGC has the knowledge and data peculiar to all configurations of the E-2C weapon systems.  Using their unique engineering, manufacturing and logistics support experience and data, only Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation can assess the feasibility, benefits and effects of integrating alternate engines on the systems design and operational characteristics of the E-2C aircraft and provide timely results to NAVAIR to support program decisions and future fleet operational requirements.  Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and systems integrator of the E-2C aircraft.  See Numbered Note 22 - NAVAIR Synopsis Number 20081-02.

<DESC>Mobile Communication Services for the Clinical Center

Background 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's foremost federally funded biomedical research institution. It is comprised of twenty-four Institutes, Centers, and Divisions. The Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center (CC) is the onsite hospital for the NIH campus (with 280 patient beds), providing full support for clinical research in inpatient and outpatient settings. The CC and ACRF facility comprise three million square feet of clinical, laboratory, and administrative space and is spread over 18 floors; 3 below ground and 15 above ground.  The new CRC under construction comprises1.5 million square feet and is spread over 8 floors, 3 below ground and 5 above ground.

The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC) is seeking the services of a mobile communications vendor in order to consolidate multiple mobile communication devices/features currently in use in the Clinical Center (i.e. pagers, cell phones and text messaging) into a one device solution the network provided by the contractor must also be capable of supporting PDAs such as Palm and Research in Motion (RIM) which the government may utilize in the future.  The period of performance for the acquisition will include a base year with (4) options.  The acquisition will require the deployment of a minimum of 400 COTS devices to replace those already in use at the CC with an opportunity to expand to up to 1,000 devices.  In addition, further requirements for this acquisition include:
 
Providing an infrastructure solution, including a digital data network for PDAs, that will support the proposed devices in all areas of the Clinical Center, the Ambulatory Care Research Facility and the Clinical Research Center (currently under construction).  
 
Providing training to up to 1,000 Clinical Center staff over a 6 week period in the proper use of the new technology deployed.
 
Providing an insurance plan for the replacement or repair of devices in the event of failure or damage.  
 
Providing a maintenance plan for infrastructure hardware and software, guaranteeing repairs made within a specified time frame as needed.  
 
A purchase order will be awarded to the vendor whose proposal represents the best value for the government including overall cost, past performance, signal strength, in building, reception and network down time.   The winning vendor must have the capability of managing several accounts under one contract to allow for expansion.
  
Purpose
The objective of this Statement of Work is to consolidate the mobile communication devices (cell-phones, pagers, text messaging, etc.) currently in use in the Clinical Center.  The contractor will be required to provide the Clinical Center with a solution package that incorporates the functionality of the current devices into one device.  In addition, the contractor will be responsible for providing an infrastructure solution to support the proposed device. The digital data network must be capable of supporting handheld PDAs (i.e. Palm, Research In Motion (RIM), etc.) as well. 
 
Scope of Work
 
At award of purchase order the contractor will be required to:
Provide the Clinical Center with approximately 400 cell phones.   The government may require additional phones under this requirement and therefore requests a cost breakdown structure that will allow increases of phones in units of 50 up to a maximum of 1000 devices. 
 
Provide a comprehensive rate plan that allows "pooled" minutes to be shared by all devices
 
Provide an in-building coverage solution (including installation) that will guarantee 98% coverage and signal strength of -85 to -90 dbm in the Clinical Center (CC), the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF) and the Clinical Research Center (CRC), currently under construction.
 		
*Prove an architecture that could be scalable across multiple buildings to support future requirements.
*Provide technical specifications of the proposed architecture for the government's review and acceptance, as well as any infrastructure changes (hardware, software, power, etc.)
Contractor must obtain government approval and/or escorted access to certain areas of the building, for example, rooftops, buildings under construction, restrictive rooms
*Provide an insurance plan for all lost/damaged hardware proposed under this requirement that must be reviewed and approved by the government prior to initiation of deployment.
*Provide a maintenance plan for the infrastructure installation that must be reviewed and approved by the government prior to initiation of deployment.
*The Clinical Center may incorporate Personal Digital Assistant devices under this requirement as well and requests the vendor to submit a cost pricing structure for an initial 100 devices.  Pooled message blocks, bandwidth, and air-time minutes plans are required to be provided by the vendor under the pooled minutes plan mentioned previously.

 
Program Management/Control Requirements
 
The contractor will meet initially with the CIO and his senior management team to establish a timeline for completion of the suggested infrastructure installation.
 
The contractor will provide weekly reports in writing to the project officer regarding progress of infrastructure installation.
 
The contractor will provide representatives for a period of 1 week between the hours of 6:00am-6:00pm for on-site training, collection of old and distribution of  new equipment, as well as development of plan for the return/disposal of old equipment which must be approved by the government.  The contractor will be required to provide an excel spreadsheet listing of all returned equipment and identify what the contractor intends to do with them (i.e. Phones, holsters, chargers,).  

The contractor will prepare monthly status reports outlining current known problems, status of all trouble tickets entered for the month for the government's account and any known upcoming outages or network disturbances.  The report will be submitted by writing and email to the Project Officer by the 3rd of each month.
 
In the event that service is interrupted for more than 30 minutes the contractor will notify a specified agent of the government by telephone to report the status of the network and estimate when the network should be functional again.  For each five minute period past the first 30 minutes the vendor will provide a ?% credit to the government's account for lack of service which directly impacts patient care.
 
In addition, the contractor must:
 
*Provide monthly electronic invoicing that can be shared by several computers on a network

*Provide  designated sales/service representative who can be reached by a direct phone line

*Provide documented escalation procedures including contact names and numbers.

*Conduct a pre-test of 20-30 telephone sets prior to the building of the infrastructure to ensure signal strength is adequate to users external of the NIH complex. 

*Test post infrastructures build out with NIH staff to ensure signal strength is adequate throughout the Clinical Center including the Ambulatory Care Research Facility and the Clinical Research Center (currently under construction). 

*Ensure that, in the event the frequency signal provided by the vendor for the NIH complex expands to the commercial and general public both the agreed upon speed and frequency of data transmission is maintained with 98% coverage and signal strength of -85 to -90 dbm in the Clinical Center (CC), the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF) and the Clinical research Center (CRC) (currently under construction)

Funding Structure
 
The purchase order will be fully funded for the initial 400 phones and base year of service/maintenance.  The procurement of additional phones/devices under this purchase order will be negotiated in writing between the project officer and account representative and will be incrementally funded throughout the life of this purchase order. 
 
Evaluation 
 
This statement of work represents a best value buy for the government.  The proposals will be rated on the following criteria: Cost of hardware, Infrastructure Value, Insurance, Maintenance, PDAs, Rate Plan and Training at 7.15%; Infrastructure Design 50%.  

Please send all proposals to amcgee@cc.nih.gov by c.o.b. 6/17/2002.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis (LEC) plans to procure continuing services relating to the "Cellular and Molecular Studies of Human Hepatocarcinogenesis in China" study at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Cancer Institute, Panjiayuan, Beijing 100021 Peoples Republic of China.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $5M.  Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in Asia and Africa.  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been identified as the major causative agent of HCC in endemic countries such as China.  However, epidemiological evidence indicates that other factors, including hepatitis C, heredity, and the mycotoxin aflatoxin B1 may also play an important role in the development of hepatocarcinogenesis.  In both Beijing and Qidong County of the People's Republic of China, there is a high incidence of chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma.  While the denizens of Beijing have a low exposure to aflatoxin B1, those living in Qidong are exposed to high levels of aflatoxin B1 from their dietary intake of contaminated foods.  There is evidence to suggest that middle-aged male carriers in Qidong may be 2-3 times more at risk to develop HCC than their counterparts in Beijing.  The unique and long standing cooperation between the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Liver Cancer Institute at the Qidong County provides a combination of rare expertise in clinical as well as in basic science aspects of liver cancer in addition to access to a unique population of high risk individuals for both chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. These unique qualifications, as well as the progress and success that has already been encountered during the previous pilot study under contract N01-CP-15618 and the recent follow-on contracts N02-BC-40538 and N02-BC-81021. This study will continue to provide unique research opportunities illustrated in the following: 1) is an increase in serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) with a low and fluctuating pattern predictive of a biostatistically significant risk for subsequent development of hepatocellular carcinoma among carriers and; 2) the ability of a considerable number of surgical specimens (30 samples per year) and case history records, in addition to serum samples take exposure to aflatoxin B1 is associated with increased allelic losses and possibly selective allelic losses during the development of HCC.  In these studies, HCC's from both Beijing and Qidong have been examined for mutations in p53.   The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that exposure to aflatoxin B1 is associated with increased allelic losses and possibly selective allelic losses during the development of HCC.  In this study,  HCC will be examined for mutations in p53, and for loss of heterozygosity for p53, RB, and APC genes and at marker loci on chromosomes 4, 13, and 16.  The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Cancer Institute is the only source that can provide the above service.  Changing variables at this time will interrupt correct interpretation of experiment in progress.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on June 12, 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

2.	Micro-processor based operation (PC based)
3.	Closed Loop Control Logic - rotating cutter sends a signal back to the micro-processor through a connection, that lets the system know what type of tissue resistance it is experiencing.  Conversely, if the rotation cuter is spinning too fast through a fatty tumor, the micro-processor will slow down the cutting process.
Smart-Vac - the smart vac clears the cavity created by previous sampling of tissue during the biopsy process of blood, therefore optimizing the biopsy sampling, and helping assure a good tissue sample.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intended to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to amend synopsis/ solicitation number N00173-02-R-RS03 for a Pedestal Tracking Mount, previously posted in the FBO on 29 April 2002. This amendment is numbered 0003. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical and business questions posed against the original synopsis/solicitation, and to extend the closing date. The closing date of the solicitation is hereby extended to 03 JUN 2002.

Question 1: The stated Target acceleration is 500 degrees/ sec/sec. How long does the target accelerate before reaching maximum velocity?  In the Manual Mode, it is stated, the Pedestal will be slaved to an external source. At what data rate will the pointing information be transferred to the pedestal in the slave mode? What is the accuracy of the external pointing system?  What is the size and contrast of the target and how far from the target is the tracking site, i.e. geometry of the test? Is a profile of the target velocity and acceleration available? Are the velocity and acceleration values for both Azimuth and Elevation? Are the maximum target velocity and acceleration values referenced to the tracking site or the target? 
Answer 1:  The gimbal shall be capable of getting up to maximum track capability in approximately 150 milliseconds upon command. The specification provided in RFP Number N00173-02-R-RS03 is for the gimbal rather than the optional camera tracker.  The Government is willing to look at any and all camera/tracker systems of varying performance that are proposed.
Question 2:  Further clarification of the evaluation factor criteria, i.e. what percentage weighting do each of the three evaluation factors carry?
Answer 2:  The Government is only required to notify offerors of the relative importance of each evaluation criteria.  See the original synopsis/solicitation for the ordinal ranking associated with this acquisition.

No other changes are made in the synopsis/solicitation.

<DESC>NA 1.  Question:  Do you consider research in how clouds and fogs process bio agents, including effects on transport, atmospheric removal, and replication type efforts to fall within the scope of topics contained in the chemical and biological agent detection  area scope of DTRA01-PRDA-02-ALO1? Answer:  Yes 2.  Question:  In regard to the solicitation, Topic 2, Chemical and Biological Detection, there is a statement (Proposals are anticipated to be under $10M for the base period with 5-10 awards anticipated in this area).  What is a budget number to target in  preparing the proposal and scope?  Would the maximum budget considered for a two year program be $2M, or roughly $1M per year?  Answer:  Budget for individual awards is maximum $5M-$10M over the period of performance for all possible years.   3.  Questions: A)Regarding topic area 2, have there been any industry days or similar events for this?  Answer: No  B) Question: Can you provide information on who is involved with this work currently?  Answer:  No  C)Question: Is this PRDA a follow on to any other solicitation or are there incumbents of any sort?  Answer:  No. D)Question:  Was there any white paper round prior to this solicitation?  Answer: no, this solicitation is only for full proposals.E)Question:  Could you provide us with a technical contact in topic area 2. Answer:  No 4.  Question:  Is there a Standard Form or format regarding budget submission for proposals for DTRA01-PRDA-02-ALO1? Answer: The format for the cost proposal is listed in the solicitation in Fedbizopps.   5.  Question:  We assume that the DTRA focus may be primarily biological. However, we have a chemical sensing agent approach.  Would submission of a chemical agent only detection scheme fit within the scope of the chemical-biological focus or can you be mo re specific as to the emphasis/focus of biological vs. chemical as it relates to submission of a proposal for a chemical agent detection system. Answer:  Primary emphasis is biological, however, promising new chemical technologies are desired. 6.  Question:  The solicitation does not provide any guidance as to how far to carry the chemical and/or biological agent detection system.  Would DTRA be expecting fieldable demonstrations at the end of the program?  Are hardware deliverables anticipated?   Or, is a feasibility demonstration sufficient with a final report to document the results?  The solicitation does say that validation of devices is desired.  Does this imply delivery of a system to a third party for independent validation? Answer:  DTRA expects vendors to rapidly develop fieldable prototype devices.  These devices should be commercially available to local, state, and federal agencies within a reasonable period of time following demonstration.  At the end of the period of performance, DTRA  expects a final report documenting technical performance and a prototype.  Validation by an independent third party is not required.  However, DTRA reserves the right to submit prototype devices to an independent third party for validation. 7.  Question:  We are a company who develops products commercially.  Usually we develop with our own internal funds and offer the product for sale in the market. In this situation of a contract resulting from this solicitation, we would be funded to do the development.  Would we have the exclusive right to exploit the resulting technology, or could we obtain that right before commencing the project? Answer: Any res earch developed with government funds, the government would have unlimited or at least government use rights for any product development resulting from the contract. 8.  Question:  What is the application procedure (what you want to see), timescales for go/no go decisions? Answer:  All information required for submission of the proposal is contained in the Solicitation DTRA01-02-PRDAALO2.   9.  Regarding Topic Area 1.2 Improved Neutron Detectors A) Question: What is the shape or form of the neutronsource that is of highest concern to DTRA?Answer:  DTRA is interested in the detection/identification of nuclear weapons or Radiological Dispersal Devices.  These can take many forms, but for simplicity generally should be regarded as subcritical and spher ical for the purposes of this PRDA. B) Question:  Is the purpose of the measurement to identify the energy spectrum of neutron emissions, or to identify the presence of neutrons where you might not expect them? Answer:  Both. In the detection and identific a tion of special nuclear materials just the mere presence of neutrons above background is an indicator that a material of interest exists.  The general neutron background is low, so an increase in neutron population is generally an item of interest.  The en ergy spectrum of the neutron may also be of interest in helping to locate and characterize the material causing the neutron emission.  Additionally, identifying fast, epithermal, and thermal neutrons will assist in assessing personnel hazards due to qualit y factors.  A fast to thermal ratio can also provide a sense of shielding/quantity of material at risk. C) Question:  To what extent are the neutrons moderated by the time they reach the detector? Answer:  This depends upon the amount of shielding and mate rials that a neutron interacts with.  There will be some moderation, but there should be significant fast neutrons several meters from the container above background.  The item and/or the container may not comply with all Department of Transportation requi rements for transport on public roads (10 CFR Part 71).  Shielding may be significant in some situations. D) Question:  What is the required time resolution for the neutron detector?  Must neutron identification be made promptly (i.e. screening measurement s) or is the focus on precise determination for the type and strength of the neutron source? Answer:  Primarily the time resolution needs to be made promptly.  In an arms control environment, there could be 5-10 minutes available for detection.  However,in  a counter terrorism role the initial detection time drops to under a minute.  Counter-terrorism forensic examinations might have more time, but more information would be needed. E) Question:  What is the minimum fluence or fluence rate that needs to be id entified by the neutron detectors?Answer:  Some basic facts can be used to determine approximate fluxes.  In the arms control environment, any amount of weapon grade plutonium above 0.5 kg is considered as potentially useful in a nuclear weapon assembly. W eapon grade plutonium can crudely be defined as 90% plutonium 239, and 10% plutonium 240 or other constituents.  A similar consideration is given to highly enriched uranium (HEU) with a concentration of 20 percent or more of U-235 and/or U-233.  The neutro n emission can be approximated to radiate out uniformly from a sphere.  There will be attenuation of the neutron emission because of self shielding within the material and the shielding of the storage container. F)Question:  Is the primary objective to dev elop a stationary neutron detection system, or must it be portable? Answer:  The primary goal is to develop portable detection systems.  There may be a need to develop some stationary systems/portal monitors dependent upon the development of new detection materials. g.  Question:  To what extent can sensitivity be sacrificed in order to obtain the direction of the incident neutrons? Answer:  The primary goal is to detect and identify.  First, we must be able to establish the presence of a neutron-emitting s ource.  If we cannot do that, then direction does not matter.  There will be a trade-off.  Either method should provide sufficient signal to rule out false indication, i.e. efficient and sufficient detection above background.  Directionality is of most int erest in a high clutter background or at a longer distance.  In either situation, sensitivity is still a key advantage. 10. Question:  In regard to topic area 1, Radionuclide detectors, if a modeling only response were proposed to address additional issues that will determine the ultimate performance of CZT based detectors, would such a modeling only proposal be considered as responsive? Answer:  Yes 11.  Question:  Is the comment on page 4 of section 1 Successful proposers will recognize the value of coordinating efforts with diverse teams from the DOD contractor industry and the DOE national labs only associated with Topic 3 or does it pertain to all  topics?Answer: This answer was listed under Topic Area 3.  This relates to information exchange and coordination rather than teaming.  DOE or DOD labs are not permitted to propose as a prime or a subcontractor under this solicitation. 12.  Question:  Under Topic 2, Is the hope that proposals will integrate efforts in a number of sub-topics (Software Development and environmental monitoring) or can a proposal emphasizing one subtopic be successful? Answer:  Technical proposals will be ev aluated as sub topics.  Consideration will be given to integrated technical proposals that clearly demonstrate synergy. 13.  Question:  We have the PRDA solicitation which is listed in two parts, part one being the solicitation and part two being the modification 01 to the solicitation.  Is there any other information about this proposal?  Answer:  No, other than any modifi cations to the synopsis posted on fedbizopps. 14.  Question:  a.  Does the prohibition against proposals requiring performance by an FFRDC also apply to a proposal that utilizes the services of an FFRDC as a subcontractor?  Answer:  Yes, the same prohibition applies.  b) Question:  What about if the F FRDC (DOE OR DOD Lab) is used as an unpaid collaborator?   Answer:  The same rule applies. 15.  Question:  We have development technologies that can be employed to make Commercial off the shelf display based devices.  This approach would require testing to be performed by DOD labs.  Would this development be relevant to this solicitation?  Answe r:  Federal labs (DOE or DOD labs) are prohibited to participate as a prime or subcontractor in this solicitation. 16.  Question:  Can a group apply to this solicitation which includes a foreign organization? Answer: Yes 17.  Question:  Is the solicitation open to non-US individuals and institutions? Answer: Yes 18.  Question:  Can proposals be submitted by Federal Government laboratories as well as private businesses, or are proposals limited to private sector organizations?  Answer:  Federal labs (DOE or DOD labs) are prohibited from proposing on this solicitati on.   19.  Question:  At the bottom of the solicitation, there is a statement place of performance with the address being Fort Belvoir.  Does this mean that the program will be run out of Fort Belvoir, or if the technical work itself must be performed there. Ans wer:  The technical work will be performed at the contractor's address.  The program will be run out of Fort Belvoir. 20.  Question:  Do the Sections on Contract and Proposal List and Funding Organization count against the 35 page limit? Answer: Yes, the correct maximum pages is 45 pages which includes the section on contracts and proposal list. 21.  Question:  Is biosensor device development a valid area of work under this solicitation?  Answer:  Yes, with the only constraint being the need for a fieldable prototype within the period of performance. 22. Question: Regarding Topic area 2, a) Would DTRA consider funding several related projects as one project with a number of individuals working on separate but related microarray technology projects? Answer:  Teaming is permitted   b. Question:  What size award or size range do you expect to make? Answer:  Budget for total contract amount of individual contracts is $5M-10M or less for the total period of performance (maximum 2 yr. base period and 1 option year). c. Question:  What kind of research are you looking to fund-more new technology (i.e. new ways of maki ng arrays but with known chemical or biological interactions) or more new science (fundamentally superior ways of detecting bacteria and toxins) or both? Answer:  Both, emphasis is on the former. d.  Question:  What type of deliverable are you looking for at the end of the project?  Would you want a completely working and packaged array chip that could be inserted directed into a commercial reader?  Or would you want something more along the lines of a proof of concept chip that demonstrated it would be superior technology if commercialized? Answer:  A final technical report and a limited number of prototype devices (NTE 10).  Emphasis is on prototypical devices.  Limited proof of concept demonstrat ions are permitted if the technology demonstrates superior technical performance and can be easily manufactured. 23.  Question:  The stated technical proposal page limitation is 45 single spaced pages.  The PRDA also states individual proposals should be directed to only one topic area.  Can a single contractor submit a separate technical proposal for each topic area , therefore providing up to 3 times the 45 technical pages limitation and a separate cost proposal in each of the three topic areas? Answer: Yes 24.  Question:  Though the PRDA states individual proposals should be directed on only one topic area, since several sections of the proposal for a given topic area will duplicate the same materials in the proposal for a different topic area, would an offe ror be allowed to bundle proposals for two or three topic areas into a single package, providing cross references between the topic area sections to pertinent material in other sections? Answer:  No. Each proposal must be separate for each topic area. 25.  Question:  Will there be separate awards under each topic area? Answer:  Yes 26.  Question:  Will DTRA make a single award to the contractor covering more than one topic area and more than one proposal? Answer:  No, each proposal submitted must be specific to only that topic area.   Individual awards will be made according to eacht opic area. 27.  Question:  Under Topic Area 1, DTRA is looking for Improved Neutron Detection systems, can the contractor propose alternative approaches to the same end that meet or exceed the current detection capabilities?Answer:  Yes, the topic area does allow for  alternate methods to detect neutrons. 28.  Question:  It is stated in the solicitation that No plastic or other type of document protector shall be used.  Does this include binding?Answer:  Yes 29. Question: It is stated in the solicitation that The technical proposal length shall not exceed 45 single spaces pages and that the page limitation does not include the cost proposal.  It is also stated that CV's should be included as Annex A to the pro posal and will not be counted against the proposal page limitation.  Does the 45 page limitation include: (A) cover page, table of contents, (b) Summary Page, (c) Proposal narrative, (D) Statement of Work; (E), Proposed schedule,  (G) Contract and proposal  list, and (H) funding Organization list? Answer:  Yes, A, B, C, D, E, G, and H are all included in the 45 page limitation.  30. Question:  It is requested that an extension in the due date for proposals be granted to June 21, 2002.  Answer:  No extension is granted; the RFP is already open for 45 days (from 25 April 2002 to 10 June 2002).  The due date for proposal submission i s 10 June 2002, 2PM EST.  Offerors are reminded that the address for submission of the proposals is: Defense Threat Reduction Agency/ALO, ATTN: J. Thodos, 14703E Willard Rd, Chantilly, VA  20151-1705.  In addition, as stated in the solicitation, handcarrie d or faxed proposal will not be accepted.  31.  Question:  Regarding Topic Area 2, what approach should one propose if an integrated photonic approach that uses one Digital Signal Processor and spectrograph to cost effectively monitor and trigger the detection and identification of any NBC threat i s the objec tive?  Answer:  Its a business decision of the offeror.  32.  Question:  Regarding Topic Area 3: A)At high altitude, both regional-scale and global-scale issues are important.  We can address either or both.  Which better meets the needs? Answer: Both scales are of interest.  The proposer should give reasons for  exploring one scale rather than the other, along with discussion of continuity from one scale to another and limitations of one methodology from the other. B)  Question:  The ability of the numerical model to represent accurately the transport, as well as  thermal radiation and chemistry is crucial and a recognizably complex problem that requires making some crucial trade-offs.  Does DTRA have any preference for focusing on the dynamics to begin with, or prefer a more inclusive (but dynamically less accurat e) treatment? Answer: There are no preferences, but the proposer should explain both pros and cons, along with limits of application.. C) Question: How important for your current needs is the inclusion of lower altitude (within the same model) in a high al titude work?  This is an important interfacing issue if DTRA already has models for ground explosion or fallout from high altitude. Answer:  Interest is limited.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Space Science and Engineering Center for the software development of a web based tool for storm analysis using multiple data sets with the following technical specifications:  
(1) Designing a framework for accessing satellite, radar, lightning and forecast model data using THREDDS, ADDE and DODS protocols and interfacing to tracking software.  (2) Developing code to retrieve these distributed data over the internet for moving storm locations in realtime using VisAD- and
McIDAS-based libraries.  This will also entail creating an on-line
storage and retrieval methodology applicable to the project, so
that a short-term history can be available, as required by the tracking software.  This data will be made available to client applets using a Java-coded server.  (3) Developing web-based interactive applets and applications for extracting data within user-defined regions and time domains, and
presenting time-series and other graphs to the user.  The client
side of these programs will be coded in Java and make use of portions of the VisAD library, while the server side will make use of a combination of VisAD and McIDAS routines and library functions.  Most of this work will be done so as to work in a web browser environment. (4) Refine existing Java applets for display of individual storm tracks and time-series plots by allowing them to accept a wider variety of data from a remote server and present them in a more meaningful manner. (5) This project requires an individual with a working knowledge of McIDAS, Java, VisAD, THREDDS, ADDE, DODS and interactive systems.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This synopsis is issued for information only. Based on the market research conducted, no competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not the use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  The award decision will be based upon the best value to the Government, with technical merit, past performance and availability being more important than price.   Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE. Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date 6/18/02.

<DESC>USPS SEEKING SOURCES - The United States Postal Service's (USPS) Corporate Contact Management (CCM) program seeks to implement a comprehensive turn-key contact center network solution that reduces costs, increases efficiencies and improves customer care through enterprise consolidation and integration of the disparate services, technologies, and communications providers throughout its various customer contact centers.  Increased operating efficiency focuses on the combination of processes and technology that maximizes the value of the contact center solution.  Improvement in enterprise customer care focuses on the channel-integrated quality of current contact handling services and the channel-integrated development of future revenue enhancing ones for USPS products.

This solution will minimize overall contact center program cost by enabling the USPS to gain economies of scale, maximize use of current internet technologies, and streamline enterprise customer care through deployment of a consistent customer contact platform.  It should also provide for revenue generating opportunities through potential strategic partnerships with contact center industry leaders and improvement in customer satisfaction as industry knowledge and best practices are leveraged across the entire contact center channel. Through comprehensive replacement and intelligent reconfiguration, this solution will best transform the USPS existing call management infrastructure into a 21st century contact management infrastructure that is synchronized and integrated with USPS Customer Relationship Management (CRM) processes and systems across toll-free, email, Web or other customer communication channels.

CCM seeks to pre-qualify suppliers who can propose and execute a plan that seamlessly consolidates and streamlines the current USPS call center network (71.5 million annual contacts) into a fully integrated and managed "contact" center network.   A comprehensive competitive solicitation will allow for overall network reconfiguration and resizing that minimize labor market costs and offers strategic partnerships with one or more contact center service suppliers.  In addition, this solicitation provides for the complete outsourcing of all contact center technology infrastructure systems as well as its integration, implementation, and management to the same contact center supplier(s). This includes, but is not limited to enterprise contact center software, network IVR services, and private VoIP network deployments.

FREEMARKETS, Inc. - The firm FreeMarkets will be facilitating this effort. FreeMarkets is the leading global provider of e-sourcing software and service solutions, and operates the world?s largest sourcing market. Through its unique combination of industry-leading, web-based software, in-depth supply market information, market operations and expert sourcing services, FreeMarkets has helped customers around the world source more than $25 billion in goods and services in more than 190 different supply verticals.  FreeMarkets can be found on the Web at www.freemarkets.com.

REQUIRED SUPPLIER CRITERIA AND OTHER INFORMATION - The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available Contact Center Network Solution(s). Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Information Dissemination Management (IDM) Division is seeking sources that are capable of providing a product, preferably a commercial "off-the-shelf", with metadata search engine capability for the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet).  Please refer to the table for a listing of specific requirements the product must target.

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), IDM Division is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to industry.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY!!  It is neither a Request for Proposal (RFP)/solicitation, nor an indication that DISA will contract for the items and services described in this RFI.  There is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  The Government does not intend to award a contract solely on the basis of the RFI.  The Government will NOT pay for information received in response to this RFI.  Submitted documents will NOT be returned to those firms who provide responses to this RFI.  The objective of this RFI is to obtain market research in order to assist in the development of preliminary acquisition planning. All interested parties must respond  via e-mail with information on their product and services with sufficient technical and cost information to allow for a detailed evaluation to the Technical Point of Contact, (POC) Ginny Parsons, PH: (703) 681-2474, email: parson1g@ncr.disa.mil or Acquisition Liaison POC Patsy Lake, PH: (703) 882-1008, email: lakep@ncr.disa.mil no later than 20 June 2002.  The subject line of the e-mail should be "Search Broker Capability".  The NAICS code is 511210.

Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. The vendor will incur, if applicable, all costs associated with modifying the product in order to meet the requirements listed. Firms who wish to respond to this RFI should include:  a brief summary of the products offered in response to this RFI,  a statement indicating an interest and capability to produce the product as described,  an estimate of the time required to develop, test, and deliver the product and supporting documentation,  and a cost/rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the licensing and maintenance options for the product is needed for budgetary planning purposes.
  
IDM is the subset of information management that addresses the awareness, access, delivery, and dissemination support of information for the warfighter.  IDM enterprise services will provide a common suite of distributed, network capabilities across domains to facilitate the "push" and "pull" of information.  IDM will enable network-centric information operations to support command and control requirements.  The following is a summary of the four IDM core services and their associated functions:  Awareness:  Search Services, Advertising, and Cataloging; Access:  Information Profiling and Policy Management;  Delivery:  Retrieval Services, Resource Monitoring, and Delivery Planning; and  Support :  Security, Directory, and Catalog Services

The IDM architecture will be implemented in accordance with the Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) and Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) specifications.  An open architecture will be essential to enable the horizontal and vertical integration of existing DoD information systems.  IDM enterprise services will utilize "cross-platform" commercial standards to provide legacy system integration as well as to promote future expansion capabilities for technology insertion.  A scalable architecture will be required to support the secure data integration of "forward-deployed" repositories for metadata search and retrieval between operational and support infrastructures.

The IDM enterprise services architecture must be developed within the DoD Network Operations (NETOPS) framework.  It must complement existing as well as planned DoD information assurance (IA) countermeasures (i.e. intrusion detection, firewalls, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), and Common Access Cards (CAC), etc) as well as on-going DoD network management initiatives (i.e. the Joint Network Management System (JNMS)). 

The following capabilities have been identified for the IDM Metadata Search Engine in accordance with DoD enterprise service requirements:  a) Metadata Search and Retrieval, b)  Database Publishing / Information Source Cataloging and "Smart" Updates,  c) Information Profiling (Profile Management for Information Producers, Users, and Commanders; Dynamic Profiling; and Profile-Driven Information Delivery for "Planning" and "Survival"), d)  Information Prioritization, e) Policy Management, f) Knowledge Management / Content Management, g) Secure Access (Identification, Authentication, Data Integrity, Non-Repudiation), h) Network Management Integration (i.e. JNMS) (Information Flow Awareness / "Smart Routing" to monitor and change the data communications path for "Intelligent" Information Dissemination), h) Scalability [Multiple Format Searching (e.g. Word documents, Adobe Acrobat "pdf" files, images, briefings, audio, video, etc), Organizational Domain Integration / Cross-Platform Protocol Usage (e.g. Extensible Markup Language (XML)), Terrestrial-to-Satellite Integration (Global Broadcast Service (GBS) and future evolution to two-way data/image/video transmissions), Support remote locations or users with limited bandwidth, e.g., tactical environment, Wireless Integration, Data, Voice, Imagery, and Video Streaming, and Storage / Archive Capabilities].


The IDM Capstone Requirements Document (CRD) should be used as a reference for a more in-depth discussion of threshold and objective IDM requirements.  In addition, the GIG CRD, as well as Joint Vision 2020, provides a high-level perspective for IDM deployment capabilities and functionality.

<SUBJECT>A -- Career Transition Training Service
<DESC>The recent redirection of funding to increase war-fighter and weapons support spending mandated by the war on terror has urged the Government to reduce its workforce substantially.  In response to the workforce reduction, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has an immediate requirement for career transition training services to support the Office of Management Operations in developing a career transition training program for the senior executives and other career personnel within DARPA.  To fulfill the requirement, DARPA intends to enter into a contract with Career Management International, Inc. (CMI) to develop a career transition training program tailored to meet the Department of Defense (DoD) imperative by helping individuals departing DARPA to make a smooth transition which will serve the interest of DoD by avoiding costly and time-consuming grievance defense process, which could be generated by disgruntled employees.  CMI is an industry leader in outplacement, career management and corporate personnel development, and a global provider for outplacement and career counseling for a number of national firms.  Because of the urgency in fulfilling the requirement as increased number of senior and professional employees are departing the agency, and in view of CMI's diverse professional skill base and its exceptional past performance in working with DARPA in previous contracts, CMI is the only source known to the Government with the capabilities, experiences and personnel for accomplishing the subject effort within the Government cost and schedule constraints.  This Notice is published for the purpose of information only.  This Notice is not a Request for Proposals.  Contractors capable of offering their service must respond within 15 days of the date of this notice by submitting specific capability statement to provide the service.  All responses received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>R -- Request For Information Only for new technologies and no cost product samples for Naval rotorcraft.
<DESC>Passenger, Crew and Aircraft Crash Protection

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division is requesting information (RFI) from potential sources for the following specific requirements.  The U.S. Navy is interested in information regarding new technologies and no cost products samples that could enhance occupant crash protection for Naval rotorcraft that experience a significant percentage of their mishaps over-water.  The technologies and products would need to be capable of being developed and integrated into existing and future Naval and joint service rotorcraft. Of particular interest are innovative approaches that could increase occupant crash protection for both water and ground mishap scenarios, and those that could be deployed with reduced cost and weight penalties when compared to conventional approaches.  Examples of the types of technologies and products sought include the following:

Systems that could improve occupant crash protection by reducing the vertical component of impact acceleration transmitted to aircrew and passengers.  Approaches are sought that could compensate for the ineffectiveness of energy absorbing landing gear and conventional energy absorbing sub-floor structures in water mishaps, and complement/enhance the performance of energy absorbing seating systems.

Systems that could reduce the probability and severity of head, torso, and limb contact injuries with rotorcraft crew stations, flight controls, and interior structures.  Concepts are sought that could complement or enhance the performance of existing occupant restraint systems.  

Systems that could facilitate the rapid post-crash emergency egress of aircrew and passengers in ground mishaps and over-water mishaps in which escape often occurs underwater, inverted, and in darkness. 

The Navy is interested in minimizing crew compartment accelerations and forces during crashes, and to reduce the severity of injury to occupants, and to enhance post-crash escape with innovative design solutions.   

The Standard Industry Code (SIC) is 8711 or North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) 541330.  Interested parties are requested to submit a brief one-page statement demonstrating their capability to perform the services listed above.  Interested sources should clarify if their product is commercially available or if the product would be a non-developmental item that could be modified to meet the governments needs. Related information, brochures, photos, concept papers, copies of drawings, may be submitted via e-mail to VegaRodrigZ@navair.navy.mil. or to the following address: Crashworthy and Escape Systems,  ATTN: Ms. Zoraida Vega Rodriguez , Code 4.6.2.2 Bldg 2187, Suite 1280-B8, NAVAIRSYSCOMHQ, 48110 Shaw Road, Unit 5, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1906.  
Interested sources should also indicate whether or not they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8 (a), or large business. The Government is not committed nor obligated to pay for the information provided and no basis for claims against the Government Shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or Government use of such information.  No solicitation documents exist and no further information is available at this time.  The deadline for response to this request is 28 June 2002.
