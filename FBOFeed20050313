<DESC>D-OMB Circular A-76:  Department of Defense (DoD) Public-Private Competition of information technology activities performed by the DoD Contract Management Agency (DCMA), in OH.  Reference No. S5105A-04-TT12.

Document Type:  Special Notice;
POC:  Mr. Robert Diamond, DCMA Competitive Sourcing Program Manager;  
Classification Code:  D – Information Technology services, including telecommunications services;

Description:  In accordance with the procedures specified in the revised OMB Circular A-76, May 29, 2003, this notice represents the formal public announcement of the initial performance decision for the Streamlined Competition identified above.  A streamlined competition form (SLCF) certified the cost estimates used to make this initial performance decision.  The SLCF compared the total cost of agency (DoD) performance to an estimated private sector cost based on market research and identified the private sector cost estimate as the low-cost provider.  

By law, DoD may not convert this activity to private-sector performance unless a public-private competition is conducted that includes the government’s most-efficient organization and the solicitation of private sector offers. Accordingly, prospective service providers are advised that a solicitation will be issued for these services.  The Department of Defense Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is Mr. Philip W. Grone, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment).  The DoD Component Competitive Sourcing Official (CCSO) is Darryl A. Scott, Major General, USAF, Director, DCMA.  POC for questions is Robert Diamond, Competitive Sourcing Program Manager, DCMA, 703-428-1493.

(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designed for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 		(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.  Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS+4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS+4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address.  The DUNS+4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the offeror to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.

Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation.

(5) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. 		(6) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. 					(End of provision) 52.212-2   	EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS  (JAN 1999) (a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each Offeror's submission is evaluated according to the factors shown below.  Factors A, B, and C are roughly equal to each other; factor D is less important.    A)	Compliance with solicitation requirement (Adobe Part Number considered) B)	Product Availability  C)	Delivery Schedule (10 business day delivery) D)	Price Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between offerss that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror. 	(b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 	(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
