<DESC>SYNOPSIS: The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capability Development and Planning Division (XRX) is conducting market research analyses to examine applicable materiel concepts and related technology for a Next Generation Tactical Aircraft (Next Gen TACAIR) capability with an initial operational capability (IOC) of approximately 2030. The envisioned system may possess enhanced capabilities in areas such as reach, persistence, survivability, net-centricity, situational awareness, human-system integration, and weapons effects. It must be able to operate in the anti-access/area-denial environment that will exist in the 2030-2050 timeframe.<br /><br />This capability request for information (CRFI) is open to all companies. No contract is intended to be awarded as a result of this CRFI, however any follow on announcements/contracts related to a Next Gen TACAIR system will be restricted to US companies or those meeting the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) requirements for foreign owned companies with Defense Security Service (DSS) approved mitigation for performing classified work. Responses to this CRFI are due no later than 17 Dec 2010. Those interested are encouraged to submit cost data if available. Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights; however, if any information is considered proprietary, then the cover page and pages containing such information must be marked accordingly. Multiple responses, each addressing a concept or family of concepts are encouraged (but not required) from each party.<br />TITLE: Next Generation Tactical Aircraft (Next Gen TACAIR) Materiel and Technology Concepts Search <br /><br />CAPABILITY DESCRIPTION: ASC/XRX is conducting market research analyses to examine applicable materiel concepts and related technology for a Next Gen TACAIR capability with an IOC of approximately 2030. The envisioned system may possess enhanced capabilities in areas such as reach, persistence, survivability, net-centricity, situational awareness, human-system integration, and weapons effects. The primary mission in the future Next Gen TACAIR definition is Offensive and Defensive Counterair to include subset missions including Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Close Air Support (CAS) and Air Interdiction (AI). It may also fulfill airborne electronic attack and intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance capabilities. This is not an all-inclusive list and the Next Gen TACAIR definition will mature and sharpen as the market research and Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) unfold. The ongoing CBA is assessing potential capability gaps, while this CRFI will support a concurrent market research assessment. The future system will have to counter adversaries equipped with next generation advanced electronic attack, sophisticated integrated air defense systems, passive detection, integrated self-protection, directed energy weapons, and cyber attack capabilities. It must be able to operate in the anti-access/area-denial environment that will exist in the 2030-2050 timeframe.<br /><br />ASC is issuing this CRFI to support Air Combat Command (ACC) in their effort to establish potential weapon system concepts and future operating environment definition, establish a common understanding of future capability needs, and define key enabling technologies and their path to maturity. This CRFI will support requirements generation/refinement and provide decision-making products (including cost analyses) required to estimate operational benefits. <br /><br />The Government is issuing this CRFI to conduct market research in accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. This market research is for information and planning purposes only. Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information you provide. Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be evaluated as a proposal. However, respondents' information may be used, not attributed to a particular respondent, as a basis to engage with appropriate USAF organizations to inform and clarify the Next Gen TACAIR concept and mission needs. Not responding to this CRFI does not preclude participation in any future announcements/ contracts related to a Next Gen TACAIR system.
<p>Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The government appreciates that interested firms may not be able to respond to this CRFI without disclosing information deemed "proprietary" or "competition sensitive". Data submitted in response to this CRFI will be widely distributed and discussed within the Government as it will be used to assist in developing an acquisition strategy for any future ACC Next Gen TACAIR program. It is the responsibility of respondents to mark submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings. The Government's analyses of responses will require disclosure of your responses to contractor personnel who directly support the Government. The analysis team will be reminded of their obligation to protect submitted information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All support contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government Project Manager determined the support contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information.</p>
<p>APPROACH: The Government's objective is to develop a range of promising options at several capability and affordability levels. The Government is interested in responses from industry in the following format(s):<br />1. Materiel Concept - Provide a clear and thorough description of materiel concepts that may define a Next Gen TACAIR system with capabilities to accomplish counterair missions in a 2030 operating environment. Correlate each concept to applicable technology white papers (see below). The concepts should be based on sound operational analysis/experience, and be grounded in current concept of operations (CONOPS) and/or plausible future CONOPS circa the 2030+ environment. Respondents may provide multiple materiel concepts. Each concept should be provided as a separate white paper.</p>
<p>2. Technology Concept - Provide a description of the technology concept and the operational benefit it will add to a Next Gen TACAIR system. Estimate and explain the reasonable likelihood of the technology meeting Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by the 2020 timeframe. Provide an assessment of the current TRL based on the scale provided in the Technology Readiness Level table below. For planning purposes, estimate budget needed to advance the technology from its current state to TRL 6. Discuss risks and technical challenges that must be resolved to reach TRL 6. Identify any enabling technologies which must also be developed to ensure successful implementation of the applicable technology concept. Describe any demonstrations, experiments, testing and/or prototyping performed to date. Summarize resulting data and conclusions. Describe technology objectives and key technical metrics for future development. Discuss potential cost issues. State whether these programs are currently funded through TRL 6 maturity, and broadly identify funding sources (DoD-funded, independent research and development-funded, etc.). Predict system integration risk and operational limitations in an operational TACAIR environment. Please provide a separate white paper for each technology concept or family of related and complimentary technology concepts; multiple white papers may be provided. Of key interest to the Government is technology which is applicable to the following areas (these interest areas are not all inclusive and may change depending on the outcome of the CBA):</p>
<p>a) Air Vehicle<br />b) Vehicle/Sensor Protection<br />c) Propulsion<br />d) Warning and Situational Awareness<br />e) Sensors<br />f) Data Fusion<br />g) Offensive/Defensive Systems<br />h) Automatic Target Recognition (Ground and Air)<br />i) Communications, Networks, and Data Links<br />j) Kinetic Weapons<br />k) Non-kinetic Weapons<br />l) Electronic Warfare and Information Operations<br />m) Secondary Power Generation, Storage and Management<br />n) Thermal Management and Heat Rejection<br />o) Human System Integration (HSI) <br />p) Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) and Optionally Manned Systems</p>
<p>Technology Readiness Level Description<br />1. Basic principles observed and reported. Lowest level of technology readiness. Scientific research begins to be translated into technology's basic properties.<br />2. Technology concept and/or application formulated. Invention begins. Once basic principles are observed, practical applications can be invented. The application is speculative and there is no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumption. Examples are still limited to paper studies.<br />3. Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept. Active research and development is initiated. This includes analytical studies and laboratory studies to physically validate analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology. Examples include components that are not yet integrated or representative.<br />4. Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment. Basic technological components are integrated to establish that the pieces will work together. This is relatively "low fidelity" compared to the eventual system. Examples include integration of "ad hoc" hardware in a laboratory.<br />5. Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment. Fidelity of breadboard technology increases significantly. The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so that the technology can be tested in simulated environment. Examples include "high fidelity" laboratory integration of components.<br />6. System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond the breadboard tested for level 5, is tested in a relevant environment. Represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness. Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment.<br />7. System prototype demonstration in an operational environment. Prototype near or at planned operational system. Represents a major step up from level 6, requiring the demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment. Examples include testing the prototype in a test bed aircraft.<br />8. Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration. Technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions. In almost all cases, this level represents the end of true system development. Examples include developmental test and evaluation of the system in its intended weapon system to determine if it meets design specifications.<br />9. Actual system proven through successful mission operations. Actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions, such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation. Examples include using the system under operational mission conditions.</p>
<p>RESPONSES AND PAGE LIMITATIONS: This CRFI is open to all companies.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (15) (i), All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 

Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend Contract NNA08AF13C (Ames Research Center InformationTechnology Support & Services 2, commonly referred to as ACITS 2) with Perot SystemsGovernment Services on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only OneResponsible Source, in support of Ames Research Center's (ARC) Code I, InformationTechnology Directorate. The objective is to extend the performance period for six months.The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services underACITS 2: IT Systems and Facilities Support:  The contractor is responsible for providing SystemAdministration, IT Security, Facility Support, Hardware/Software Maintenance, ApplicationManagement, Data Storage and Retrieval, Customer Support, Technical Planning, Analysis,and TrainingNetwork/Communications Systems and Support:  The contractor is responsible for providingNetwork Design and Development, Network Services, Distributed Systems, Audio, Video, andVoice Communication Systems, Wireless/Emergency Communication Systems,Network/Communication InfrastructureBusiness Systems and Support:  Financial Services, Human Resources, Security, Logistics,and Business Systems InfrastructureScientific Computing Systems and Support:  Scientific Computing consists of designing,developing, installing, modifying, configuring, operating, and maintaining software andcomputing systems in order to solve computationally intensive and/or complex engineeringand scientific problems in support of ARC missions, programs, and projects. Thecontractor is responsible for providing Scientific Applications, Data Acquisition andAnalysis, Modeling and Tool DevelopmentOutreach/Informational Systems and Support:  This information technology area isdominated by rich content that needs to be distributed efficiently and effectively tocustomers, whether they are internal to ARC, to NASA, or for the general public. Theseneeds include web applications, information-based systems for the design, development,installation, maintenance, operations, upgrades, configuration management, archiving,customer support, and security for content-rich, IT based data systems.  Examples includescientific databases and collections, geographical information systems, and digital imagearchive and retrieval systems, Library Systems, Conference/ Presentation/AdvocacySupport.This extension will allow for a continuation of services to ensure program continuity andcritical mission support and to avoid significant technical impacts to supported programswhile competitive follow-on acquisition NNA10301939R is completed. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA08AF13C,for a period of six months, from December 1, 2010, through May 31, 2011, and increase thecontract value accordingly.  The current contractor, Perot Systems Government Services,is considered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period ofperformance for the extension. Awarding an six-month contract to another source, at thesame time procurements for NASAs Agency-wide Information Technology InfrastructureIntegration Program (I3P) and ARCs follow-on ACITS 3 requirement are in process, wouldresult in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling theGovernments requirements and not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, therebyaffecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCsrequirements.The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intendsto solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Thepurpose of this action is to bridge the performance period between the end of the currentcontract and the anticipated award of the follow-on requirement.  Procurement activityfor the follow-on contract has been initiated under Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP)NNA10301939R, which has been set aside for small business. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact IN WRITING to the identified point of contact not later than 4 PM PST onNovember 12, 2010. Such communication of capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.Questions regarding the extension can be sent via email to Brenda Pohl atbrenda.k.pohl@nasa.gov.

<DESC>The US Army, Army Contracting Command Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center, Soldier Weapons Center (CCJM-SW) on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager, Soldier Weapons (PM-SW) intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Barrett Firearms Manufacturing Inc (BFMI), 5926 Miller Lane, Christiana, TN 37037 for the acquisition of six (6) M 107 A1 Long Range Sniper Rifles.
 The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition FAR 13.106(b)(1) which states "For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name, or industrial mobilization)." The United States Government currently fields the M 107 Long Range Sniper Rifle which has been manufactured by BFMI for over 20 years. BFMI is currently the only known manufacturer of the M 107. BFMI has introduced an upgraded version of the M107 System, known as the M 107A1 to provide increased accuracy, decreased weight, improved ergonomics and suppression capability. The USG does not own the rights to the drawings for the currently fielded M107 LRSR, as these are proprietary to BFMI. As such the USG lacks the ability to upgrade the weapon systems, as do any other contractors.  BFMI is the current and only producer of this state-of-the-art weapon system, thereby the reason for acquiring this limited sample quantity from the only known present producer, BFMI.
This notice is not a solicitation and does not obligate the government to issue a Solicitation, nor will the government be liable for any costs involved for submission of information in response to this notice.
Point of Contact for this action is Jon Glassic, Contract Specialist, CCJM-SW, (973)724-3142, Jon.Glassic@us.army.mil

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in relation to the provision of NATO General Communication Services (NGCS) Leased Transmission Services.  

NC3A has been authorized to use the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure with Best Value bid evaluation.  The evaluation criteria and associated weighting will be detailed within the IFB documents. 

The estimated value of the resulting contract is envisioned not to exceed Euro 12,500,000 per year and such amount will also serve as the ceiling price for the purpose of bid submission.  The contract period of services is estimated at three years with two additional one-year extensions as evaluated options.

The proposed companies must be National Public Telecommunication Operators who own and operate telecommunication infrastructure and are regulated by their national regulatory bodies.

The IFB to be issued for this acquisition will be identified as IFB-CO-13033-LTX and all correspondence concerning this solicitation should reference this number.  The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

All equipment and services provided under this contract in support of services delivered at NATO premises shall be of a NATO member state manufacturer origin.  As an example, the help desk must be located in a NATO member country and manned by NATO member nationals with NATO SECRET security clearances.

The technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents are NATO UNCLASSIFIED. For the performance of the contract, however, bidders will be required to hold a NATO SECRET security clearance for the personnel and the contractor’s facility, which must be in place prior to the contractor award.  The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NC3A the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS	

The scope of the project is to provide the transmission services required for high speed communications between the 80 main NATO nodes representing a total number of 80 sites across the 28 NATO member countries.

The operational objectives of the contract are as follows, for each site:

- Provision of the required transport services depending on site and network requirement as determined by NATO
- Provision of NATO Ethernet Devices
- Migration of all transmission services currently provided by BT to the new provider transmissions 

This contract is set up to provide high speed transport services together with all the support required during the network migration.  The scope of this contract is divided as follows:

- Leased dark fiber and leased WDM, which will be required at a limited number of network nodes (4 to 5) including the optical devices required to mange the service
- Leased Ethernet links, which will be required at approximately 75 network nodes with a bandwidth from 8 Mbps up to 1 Gbps
- Leased NATO Ethernet Devices, which will be required within NATO premises for the duration of the contract and which will be managed by NATO
- Support to the NATO Communication and Information Systems Agency (NCSA) during migration for the additional efforts related to the migration as well as relevant engineering support for trouble shooting during the migration phase

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States. 

U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.  The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

Using the contact information indicated on the DOE, the NATO contracting agency will contact the firm directly when the IFB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a DOE (and, for U.S. facilities not yet approved for NATO ICB, to submit a completed NATO ICB application): 18 November 2010

2. Anticipated date that IFB will be issued: November 2010

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: February 2011

<DESC>THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE<br /><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order to support the requirements for the project entitled, "Policy Evaluation Guide for Injury and Violence Prevention." This acquisition is a total small business set-aside that is to be competed in accordance with FAR Part 1. The proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.<br />&nbsp;
<p>Background and need:<br />Despite the fact that many injuries and acts of violence are preventable, they continue to be the leading killer of Americans in the first four decades of life. In 2005, more than 173,000 people died from unintentional and violence-related injuries and nearly 30 million people sustained injuries serious enough to require treatment in an emergency department. Many injured people are left with long-term disabilities. The total lifetime costs associated with both fatal and nonfatal injuries is estimated to exceed $406 billion.</p>
<p>CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) identifies risk and protective factors for injuries, develops and shares prevention strategies and supports organizations and individuals working to do the same. The development and implementation of policy strategies are key in addressing injuries and violence prevention at a population-based level. More research is needed in some injury and violence prevention areas where policy strategies are being used but may not have a sufficient evidence base.</p>
<p>This project will create a guide for policy evaluation of injury and violence prevention policies that will support CDC's focus areas of supporting state and local health departments and promoting health policy.</p>
<p>Project Objective:<br />The purpose of this project is to create a policy evaluation guide for injury and violence prevention policies. The guide will enable the CDC/NCIPC to evaluate federal and state policies and will allow CDC/NCIPC to better advise and assist states and partners in their efforts to evaluate health policies.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:<br />The contractor shall create a policy evaluation guide which incorporates "best practice" policy evaluation information, specific to public health policy where the science is available. The guide shall include recommended process(es) for assessing policies that can be used by NCIPC, its partners, and its grantees.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be 12 months. Request for Quote (RFQ) number 2010-Q-13051 will be issued on or about October 12, 2010, through the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fedbizops.gov. Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award. No bidder's list will be maintained. Notifications will not be sent to offerors regarding the issuance of the RFQ or any of its amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for release of this acquisition and any amendments.</p>

<DESC><p>NAVAIR intends to place a Firm Fixed Price delivery order under Contract N00019-05-G-0026 on a sole source basis with The Boeing Company in support of the F/A-18 Program for Foreign Military Sales to Switzerland and Finland. NAVAIR previously procured Upgrade 25 for Switzerland and Mid Life Upgrade 2 for Finland from the Boeing Company. In support of these FMS upgrades, this delivery order will procure customized test equipment and procedures for developmental display items for both countries, along with 82 Intercommunication System Control Units with Finland unique configuration. The estimated delivery date is 30 April 2015. As the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and system integrator, The Boeing Company is the only firm possessing the extensive knowledge and technical data peculiar to all configurations of the F/A-18 aircraft and the weapons systems used by FMS countries. Additionally, as only The Boeing Company has the engineering, manufacturing, and unique logistics support experience and technical data pertinent to the systems design and operational characteristics of the F/A-18 aircraft, they are uniquely qualified to meet the Swiss and Finnish fleet operation commitments. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation document exists. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government does not intend to fund the development or qualification of other sources for fulfilling this requirement, as production of the supplies listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation for manufacture. However, all proposals received within thirty days after the publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia Office intends to solicit on an unrestricted basis a requirement for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services in support of the Forces Surveillance Support Center (FSSC) Relocatable Over the Horizon Radar (ROTHR) System.

Additionally, the effort includes systems engineering, engineering change proposal preparation and analysis, failure analysis, configuration management, preparation, installation and testing of field change kits, logistics support, training, and repair and refurbishment services.  This requirement presents several challenges to the Contractor including having to work with a mature system, dealing with parts obsolescence, and the Government does not possess the Level III technical data associated with this unique legacy system.
The Solicitation and resulting Contract will include a combination of Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) line items.  The Period of Performance will be for a Base Year plus Four (4) One-Year Option Periods.  There will also be a ninety (90) day ramp-up time prior to commencement of services.  Services are required to commence on 01 August 2011. See Numbered Note 26.  
It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) for this requirement will be posted at the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website (www.neco.navy.mil) on or about 01 June 2010, with the closing date for the receipt of offers to be set forth in the RFP.  A hard copy of the solicitation will not be made available.  Offerors shall be required to submit both technical and cost proposals.   The Navy's evaluation of proposals will consider the offeror's technical proposal more important than the offeror's cost proposal.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government.  Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award.  See www.ccr.gov for further information and instructions.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Aerodyne Research, Inc., 45 Manning Road. Billerica, MA 01821 to upgrade Quadrupole based Aerosol Mass Spectrometer to a HighResolution Time-of Flight Mass Spectrometer (HR-TOFMS) system. The upgrade is needed in order to use improve the sensitivity, resolution and power of existing ARI Quadrapole mass spectrometer for new laboratory measurement of particle size and composition distributions. The several custom components which comprise the instrument communicate via proprietary software, and this communication is needed in order to facilitate measurements of particle size and composition distributions in near real time.  The instrument being upgrade was custom built by Aerodyne Research, including custom parts, mechanics, electronics and data acquisition, and the upgrade involves all of these systems. Without the upgrade, the instrument is only capable of measuring mass to charge ratios of unit resolution which makes empirical formulae determinations impossible. Therefore the upgrade to high resolution is needed to enable composition and size distributions. EPA has identified Aerodyne Research, Inc., the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.301-1, "only one responsible source". The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, by fax (919) E685-3178 or by e-mail at smith.pamela@epa.gov .

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) Scott Field Office will issue Requests for Quotes (RFQ) to all applicable General Services Administration (GSA), Information Technology (Schedule 70) Contract holders, through GSA E-Buy, to establish single Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) for procuring Mobile Satellite Service Solutions offered under SIN 132-55 for Inmarsat BGAN and Inmarsat Legacy Services. The National American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) code for these competitions is 517410.</p>
<p>The BGAN and Legacy services will be grouped by category and service type. The Government intends to release approximately 12 to 15 RFQs for different categories and service types, commencing on or about 1 February 2011, resulting in the establishment of a single BPA per RFQ. The first two competitions will consist of (1) BGAN Service for one DOD Military Service Department and (2) Legacy Service for the Mini M terminal type. Quotes will only be accepted from IT Schedule 70-contract holders providing COMSATCOM services under SIN 132-55 and whose contract offers the required service by the closing date of the RFQ.</p>
<p>A single BPA will be established with the IT Schedule 70-contract holder whose proposal provides the best value to the government based on evaluation criteria specified in the RFQ. The contractor's proposal will be evaluated with regard to its ability to meet the tasks set forth in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for that particular category/service type (FAR 8.405-2). The selected awardee will receive all future orders for requirements related to each category/service type from the date of selection through the period of performance specified in the RFQ.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Government will neither release an RFQ nor establish a BPA for any category/service type where there is insufficient competition based on the IT Schedule 70-contract holders' published product offerings.</p>

All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this notice, by e-mail to kfleming@usbr.gov no later than 10:00 a.m. on November 12, 2010.  The information provided in this announcement is the only information the Government has available at this time.  There are no specifications, drawings, bid packages, or source lists available.
The principal components of the work to be performed include:  
1. Laboratory Analysis for Low-Levels of Selenium and Boron as follows: 
    a. Selenium - Water Samples:  Reporting Limit 0.4 ug/L using the Fluorometric Method    b. Selenium - Soil: Using the Fluorometric Method    c. Selenium - Vegetation: Using the Fluorometric Method    d. Selenium - Tissue: Using the Fluorometric Method    e. Boron - Water: Using ICP-OES    f. Boron - Vegetation: Using ICP-OES    g. Boron - Tissue: Using ICP-OES
2.  Contractor/laboratory shall provide acceptable MDL studies for selenium and boron.
3. The Contractor/laboratory may not sub contract any analysis out.
4.  In order to receive an award the laboratory must be approved by Mid-Pacific Region's Environmental Office MP-157.  Approval will include but not be limited to passing a Quality Assurance Audit below, receiving an acceptable review of the laboratory's QA Manual, round-robin performance evaluation samples, and reporting limits.Audit Process:
The MP-157 quality assurance (QA) section conducts audits on laboratories involved in analytical activities that support MP-157 Mid-Pacific Region projects.  The audit consists of reviewing the laboratory's QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results, submitting performance evaluation samples, and conducting an onsite audit.  The review process allows the QA section to determine if laboratories are capable of performing quality analyses on Mid-Pacific Region samples while following QA/QC practices that meet or exceed Mid-Pacific Region standards and protocols.
Background Review:
Prior to the audit, the QA section will contact the laboratory QA officer or the laboratory director and request a copy of both the current QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results.  The performance study results and QA manual are reviewed by the QA section.
Performance Evaluation Samples:
Prior to the onsite audit, the QA section conducts a performance audit by submitting performance evaluation samples.  The purpose of the performance evaluation samples is to evaluate the laboratory's ability to generate accurate data.  If the laboratory performs poorly on the performance evaluation samples, the QA section may consider not conducting the onsite audit.  The parameters submitted for the performance evaluation samples will be tailored to reflect those of current Mid-Pacific Region projects and the methods the laboratory performs.  
If the laboratory does not obtain a result within the acceptance criteria, the laboratory will be directed to reanalyze the sample(s).  If the reanalyzed result is within the acceptance criteria, then the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory still does not meet the acceptance criteria upon reanalysis, a new performance evaluation sample from a different lot or vendor will be submitted.  If the laboratory can obtain an acceptable result on the new performance evaluation sample, the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory does not meet the acceptance on the original, reanalysis, or new performance evaluation sample, the laboratory will not be audited or approved for this method/parameter.
Audit Agenda:
Approximately one week prior to the audit, the auditor will send the laboratory contact a proposed audit agenda.  The audit agenda details the time allotted for the initial meeting with management, analytical method review, document review, and debrief.  After laboratory review and approval, the audit agenda will be finalized. Onsite Audit:
An onsite laboratory audit is conducted by the QA section to assess the laboratory's expertise in conducting the analyses, the capability for producing valid data, the ability to effectively support the data, and the integrity of the QA/QC practices. Meet with Management:
The first step of the audit will be to meet with management and key laboratory personnel to discuss the purpose of the audit and give a general overview about the Mid-Pacific Region and the Environmental Monitoring Branch (MP-157).  During this meeting, the audit team will discuss MP-157's policies and requirements, the performance evaluation sample results (if available), document request, and questions for the QA Officer (QAO).   Analytical Method and Document Review:
During the onsite audit, the QA officer, analysts, and other key laboratory personnel are questioned to determine their overall understanding of the methods and laboratory procedures.  Documentation practices are also reviewed.  In general, the auditors are checking to see if the laboratory procedures follow the laboratory's QA manual guidelines and the EPA method, Standard method, or other method protocols.
Debrief:
The most serious deviations are presented to the laboratory as findings in a debrief meeting at the end of the audit; the debrief is generally conducted the day after the audit.  All the deviations are written as findings or observations in the final audit report.  Audit Report:
Any deviations from accepted protocols are written in an audit report as findings.  The report can also include good practices for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to continue and observations for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to adopt.  Laboratory Audit Response and Final Approval LetterThe laboratory is asked to send a response to each finding detailed in the QA section's audit report.  The auditors will review this response and assess if the corrective actions and explanations are acceptable.  If any response is questionable, the laboratory is contacted for clarification.
Once the review of the laboratory's audit response is complete, the lead auditor will send a final letter addressing whether or not the laboratory is approved for use.
Central Contractor Registration (CCR), as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND REQUEST FOR INFORMATION NOTICE ONLY - This is NOT a request for proposal or quotations.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has a requirement for delivery of 97.5% Grade B Helium and Helium Cylinders [in accordance with Federal Specification BB-H-1168C, Dated August 3, 2000] for eleven (11) Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) of the National Weather Service (NWS). The eleven WFO locations are:</p>
<p>&bull; Gray WFO in Gray, ME<br />&bull; Taunton WFO in Taunton, MA<br />&bull; Buffalo WFO in Buffalo, NY<br />&bull; Albany WFO in Albany, NY<br />&bull; Baltimore/Washington WFO in Sterling, VA<br />&bull; Charleston WFO in Charleston, SC<br />&bull; Raleigh WFO in Greensboro, NC<br />&bull; Newport WFO in Newport, NC<br />&bull; Wilmington WFO in Wilmington, OH<br />&bull; Pittsburgh WFO in Moon Township, PA<br />&bull; VA Tech Research Center in Blacksburg, VA</p>
<p>It is estimated that the annual helium needs for each WFO is 69,642 cubic feet and 318 cylinders annually. In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.5, this is NOT a major helium requirement. The period of performance is anticipated to be three to five 12-month ordering terms. It is anticipated that multiple awards IDIQ contracts will be awarded utilizing FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.</p>
<p>NOAA is seeking the following from interested parties -</p>
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT INFORMATION: NOAA is considering whether or not to set aside this acquisition for Small Business concerns only. The small business size standard is 100 Employees. The NAICS Code is 424690.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR I NFORMATION: NOAA is considering whether or not to include an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) clause, in any resultant solicitation. Incorporation of an EPA clause would likely be based on established market prices of the end item. <br />Interested respondents are requested to provide the following -</p>
<p>(a) A positive statement of your intent to submit a quotation for this procurement to include which locations you intend to submit for offers. You must identify your size status as to whether you are considered a small business under the NAICS identified herein or a large business. <br />(b) Annual helium price fluctuations consistently occur; however, they appear stable as to the range of fluctuation; thus, it may be possible to realistically estimate future prices. Respondents are requested to identify what impact(s), if any, would result from not including an EPA clause in the resultant solicitation? Respondents are requested to identify how the market has impacted offered helium prices over the past three years and what pricing conditions are anticipated in the coming three years. It is important to provide what industry-wide contingencies would be subject to any included contract EPA. If an EPA is included what data will be provided to enable the contracting officer to establish the base level from which any adjustment will be made and what percentage of increase, per 12-month period is reasonable for industry? Lastly, if an EPA clause is not included in the acquisition, will that affect your decision as to, 1) submitting an offer; or, 2) as to how many years you would be willing to commit?</p>

<DESC>This Special Notice announces the Government's intention to modify the existing sole source contract FA2550-08-C-8012, Obscura, Mission Integration, &amp; Network Support (OMINS) with the contractor currently performing the effort (Lockheed Martin Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions) to extend the period of performance. The current contract provides support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network-Common Data) for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS). The extended period of performance is 1 January 2011 through 30 June 2011 to ensure continuation of critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) while a follow-on competitive acquisition is in progress.<br /><br />The government intends to make publicly available a Justification and Approval documenting the rationale to utilize other than full and open competition. The forthcoming Justification and Approval will cite the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data.
<p>Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.</p>
<p>Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data.</p>
<p>Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by construction or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities. Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.</p>
<p>Network-Common Data Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS OR PROPOSALS. However, interested, responsible parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement by 12:00 pm MST, 18 November 2010, via email to the attention of: james.uram@schriever.af.mil. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. No reimbursement for any costs connected with providing capability information will be provided. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The North American Industrial Classification System Number (NAICS) is 541330, Engineering Services and the size standard is $27M.</p>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7350-00-641-4518<br />Name: Cup, Paper Tableware, Disposable, Plastic Coated, Hot Foods, 12 oz<br />Description: White, Capacity: 12 oz., Squat-style cup without handle or lid is for hot foods. Cup is moisture-resistant stock or plastic coated. Round, disposable paper cup is tapered to stack easily. It is odorless and leak proof. Paper tableware.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7350-00-641-4518<br />Similar Items: SCC VS512, 641-4518</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 18, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<SUBJECT>Chemical Cartography: Urban Data Acquisition
<SOLNBR>DARPA-SN-11-06
<RESPDATE>110910
<CONTACT>Proposers' Day Coordinator, Email DARPA-BAA-11-03@darpa.mil
<DESC>PROPOSERS' DAY WORKSHOP<br />DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of DARPA-BAA-11-03, Chemical Cartography: Urban Data Acquisition program on November 15th, 2010 at the Capital Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22201 from 8:30 AM to 2:00 PM. The purpose of this workshop is to provide information on the Chemical Cartography: Urban Data Acquisition program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: The goal of Chemical Cartography: Urban Data Acquisition is to develop three-dimensional ground-truth maps of trace gases in urban areas. These maps will provide chemical concentration data for subsections of typical urban areas comprised of a mix of residential and commercial buildings, highways, public transportation, and utilities.</p>
<p>Chemical Cartography: Urban Data Acquisition encompasses two technical areas: Urban Data Collection and Urban Data Modeling. These technical areas are designed to complement one another; however a team does not necessarily need to address both. The Urban Data Collection Technical Area will develop and characterize a representative set of local urban sources, defined as discrete and identifiable operations such as gasoline stations, fast food restaurants, and dry cleaning stores that have particular emissions patterns. Chemical, meteorological, topographical, and supporting data (e.g., 3D shape files of buildings, imagery, etc.) will be collected and quantified from these locations for multiple periods of time, spaced throughout the seasonal cycle. Additionally, releases of environmentally benign tracer gases will be used to validate and refine collection statistics.</p>
<p>The Urban Data Modeling Technical Area will allow accurate urban chemical map generation using sparse field-collected data. These maps will synthesize coarse data streams of the kind described above, and output comprehensive maps of all atmospheric trace gases present in the area at a finer resolution. The model will additionally incorporate known chemical properties of various trace gases to assist in prediction of transport and dispersion through urban environments. The effort includes validation and verification exercises designed to test model predictions against data collected by Chemical Cartography: Urban Data Acquisition collections and related efforts.</p>
<p>This program is intended to leverage the capabilities presently being developed by the Hyperadsorptive Atmospheric Sampling Technology (HAST) and Panoptic Analysis of Chemical Traces (PACT) programs. DARPA will provide information on HAST and PACT at the Proposer's Day Workshop and make those briefings available to all potential proposers after the Proposers' Day Workshop. DARPA further anticipates that the capabilities developed by the Chemical Cartography: Urban Data Acquisition effort will enable future efforts that automate the analysis of the data stream output by the HAST and PACT systems, including anomaly detection, source attribution, efficient sampling strategy development, and the generation of actionable intelligence.</p>
<p>Chemical Cartography: Urban Data Acquisition Proposers' Day Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming discussions during the poster session.</p>
<p>Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address one or both of the major technical areas described in the forthcoming BAA will be critical to the success of Chemical Cartography: Urban Data Acquisition. DARPA will not be funding component technologies that address only a subset of one of the technical areas listed in the Chemical Cartography: Urban Data Acquisition solicitation. The Chemical Cartography: Urban Data Acquisition Proposers' Day will facilitate the formation of teams with the necessary expertise to respond to the BAA.</p>

<p>NO SUBSTITUTIONS ALLOWED.</p>
<p>The solicitation issue date is 03 Nov 2010. Offers are due on 10 Nov 2010 The entire solicitation will be made available only on FedBizOpps (FBO) website at: http://www.fbo.gov. All current and/or future information about this acquisition, i.e. solicitation, amendments, purchase specification, and Q &amp;A's will be distributed through FBO. Therefore, interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this solicitation.</p>
<p>AUTHORITY: 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C)(1), JUSTIFICATION: SUPPLIES REQUIRED ARE FROM ONLY ONE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF RESPONSIBLE SOURCE(S) AND NO OTHER TYPE OF SUPPLIES WILL SATISFY AGENCY REQUIREMENTS.<br />THE PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES AND SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLCIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE, OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SOURCES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.301-1. INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. HOWEVER, ALL PROPOSALS RECEIVED PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE ON THE SOLICITATION WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>This acquisition is to procure and install (175) Themis Assy, SUPIIe, 1024 MB Memory Modules (MFR# 31-110165-005) which are essential to the System Server Unit (SSU).</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br /><br />Themis USPIIIi is a VME SPARC Single Board Computer (SBC) that is a critical component to the MCE S/W program. Recent MCE S/W enhancements exceeded the current on board memory capacity and memory upgrade was required to maintain operational capabilities. Due to the proprietary nature of the Themis SBC, only the Themis name brand memory is approved and known to be functionally compatible. The USPIIe-USB memory modules are custom designed for Themis. These modules meet the physical constraints of the USPIIe motherboard they plug into. The module design electrically follows the Sun memory interface, but mechanically is specific to the USPIIe board. There are no off-the-shelf or third party modules that meet the physical requirements. The Themis memory modules are the only ones to meet the system performance specification. The increase in memory is to allow us to process data faster with a greater through put to the Operation Module. It allows us to communicate with other Tactical Air Operations Modules (TAOM). If the TAOM cannot perform its primary function then the Control and Reporting Center (CRC) is at risk. If the Operations Module is unable to perform its mission then the Air Control Squadron will not be functional. <br /><br />The custom memory modules are designed only for the ThemisUSPIIe-USB boards. The memory modules are shape and form fit only for the<br />Themis USPIIe-USB boards. The Themis Memory Modules are proprietary and are the only brand approved to be functionally compatible. <br /><br />Themis is the only Brand acceptable to the Government. No other Brand will meet the government needs.</p>

(b)	Location - Proposals will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide a facility located in downtown Chicago, IL;

The cause of the Projector failure is also due to the oil dispersants used to bonding agent and used to securing the Polyurethane to the titanium.<br />4.4. Replace the Receiver Assembly and the Array Bulkhead connector. The Receiver Assembly needs to be replaced due to the de-bonding of the Polyurethane from the titanium. This is caused by the damage from the oil dispersants used to bonding agent and used to securing the Polyurethane to the titanium. The Array Bulkhead connector has a broken strap that secures the cable.<br />4.5. The Multibeam system shall be fully operational.<br />4.6. Provide detailed service reports including Conductivity, Hydrophone Directivity and Sensitivity, and system operational test and evaluation reports.<br />4.7.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St. SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>

<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

(1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor,<br />terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-<br />(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any<br />Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2)<br />below);or<br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).<br />(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised<br />if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting<br />Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br />Modified as of 10 Sept 07<br />b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner<br />the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor<br />will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must<br />continue the work not terminated.<br />c.

Examples of such causes include<br />(1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires,<br />(4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe<br />weather.

Upon direction of the Contracting<br />Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and<br />Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and<br />for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause.<br />The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect<br />the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and<br />obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided<br />by law or under this contract.<br />11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (JAN 2005) - Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless<br />otherwise provided in this contract.

Payments and penalties for late payments are subject to the requirements established by the<br />Prompt Payment Act, as amended, and as implemented for NAFI's. If the NAFI makes payment but such payment<br />Modified as of 10 Sept 07<br />fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is<br />made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the<br />date of payment.<br />15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) - The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and<br />defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of<br />any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any<br />part thereof.

Also, Contractor shall at all<br />times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims,<br />charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees.<br />16.

TAXES (JAN 2005)<br />a. Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all taxes, duties or other<br />public charges in effect and applicable to this contract on the contract date, except any tax, duty, or other public<br />charge, which by law, regulation or governmental agreement, is not applicable to expenditures made by the NAFI or<br />on its behalf; or any tax, duty, or other public charge from which the Contractor, or any subcontractor hereunder, is<br />exempt by law, regulation or otherwise. If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the<br />contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.<br />b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or<br />in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the<br />contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or<br />in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract<br />price shall be correspondingly increased.<br />18. PROOF OF SHIPMENT (JAN 2005) - (Applicable to shipments outside the United States through the Surface<br />Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Parcel Post shipments to overseas destinations.)<br />a.

If shipment is made by insured parcel<br />post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><strong>The U.S. Department of the Treasury-The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP)</strong> is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating any technologies or materials with potential application in overt, visual authentication features in U.S. currency. <strong>Technologies offered should provide effective counterfeit deterrence against all types of threats, including both traditional printing and digital reproduction.</strong> Proposed features may be incorporated into the note (inks, substrate), or applied to the note, and should not require the use of any device for verification.<br /><br />Any technologies or materials submitted for consideration will be reviewed for <strong>inherent and relative effectiveness as a security feature, and may be further assessed for compatibility with design and production factors, durability, environmental acceptability, and other production/processing requirements</strong>. An effective feature is defined as a feature that cannot be easily simulated or duplicated; for example, a feature that can be simulated to approximate a passable outward appearance or response of a genuine feature is not effective or acceptable.
<p>Additionally, the Bureau is interested in reviewing products, materials, and technologies that will <strong>enhance the usefulness of currency notes</strong>; for example, authentication/denomination features for the visually impaired and enhancement of circulation life.</p>
<p>Current versions of currency paper and ink specifications, as well as durability testing procedures, are available upon written request.</p>
<p>The Bureau will only consider technologies or materials, for which at least laboratory feasibility has already been demonstrated (i.e., means a proven concept, can provide a sample). For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples and/or brief technical descriptions (1-2 paragraphs) plus price information for the purchase of larger test quantities to the <strong>BEP, Office of Acquisitions, Attn: Kathleen Reidy, 14th and C Streets, S.W., Room 708-A,&nbsp;Washington, D.C. 20228-0001</strong>. <br />Larger quantities of samples may be procured through simplified acquisition (small purchase) for further assessment. The Bureau may submit offered technologies to outside technical experts under government contracts for their evaluation subject to the approval of the submitting party. Previously submitted materials or technologies need not be resubmitted. <br />If you have any questions please contact <strong>Kathleen Reidy on (202) 874-2507 or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:Kathleen.Reidy@bep.gov">Kathleen.Reidy@bep.gov</a></strong></p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p>In June 2010, the Federal Cloud Computing Initiative (FCCI) established an Email Working Group to coordinate across government and industry on behalf of the FCCI, and to be the<span style="COLOR: #111111"> source of information, solutions, and processes that foster adoption of SaaS Email within the Federal Government. The working group quickly ramped up and began developing a strategy to deliver SaaS Email </span>acquisition capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>In partnership with <span style="COLOR: #111111">GSA SmartBUY and </span>DoD Enterprise Software Initiative, <span style="COLOR: #111111">the FCCI </span>released an RFI on Software as a Service Email on August 30, 2010 (posted on FBO.gov https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=d9c037373cc9491c9b3af089ad4e6e85&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1). The intent of the RFI was to gain insight into how the Federal Government ordering activities can replace their current enterprise support for email and collaboration with a highly innovative, creative, cost-effective, and evolving environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: black">Pre-Solicitation Briefing&nbsp;was held on&nbsp;November 1, 2010</span></strong></p>
<p>The FCCI&nbsp;hosted a SaaS Email briefing on November 1, 2010. The purpose of this event&nbsp;was to brief agencies and vendors interested in the FCCI's acquisition strategy for SaaS Email, and to get feedback on the draft requirements so that the resulting acquisition can best meet the needs of the Federal Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The briefing&nbsp;was held at MITRE in McLean, VA.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: black">GSA's SaaS Email Offering</span></strong></p>

<DESC>This announcement is to update the MDA HQ0147-09-ATI-BAA technical point of contact's phone number:&nbsp;Mr. Robert Barnes, MDA/DV new phone number:&nbsp;256-955-7421.&nbsp;&nbsp;As always coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission is encouraged and allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported.&nbsp;<br /><br />Introduction This announcement constitutes the annual posting of BAA, HQ0147-09-ATI-BAA as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation 35.016(c). The original announcement language is included below. Original Posted Information The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from a ballistic missile attack. The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase. MDA efforts are focused on making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries. MDA must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile. In support of these efforts, MDA programs are geared towards advancing technological thresholds in hardware and software, through scientific breakthroughs in areas such as mathematics, physics, and engineering. Technical advancement is essential to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years. MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term. The MDA Director, Advanced Technology (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability. MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Advanced Technology Innovation (ATI) Program to identify and develop innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS. ATI is a competitive, science and technology research program, which consists of forefront research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984." The MDA contracts with private industry, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations for research in those areas covered in this BAA. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards, however, if MDA decides to pursue a concept the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing. Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle. Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Mr. Robert Barnes, MDA/DV; 256-450-2032, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources to preparing a concept paper or proposal in response to this BAA. Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported. Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contracts are anticipated to be awarded for these efforts. Any awards are anticipated to occur in fiscal year (FY) 2009 through FY 2010. Research Topics MDA/DV is interested in Advanced Technology Development (ATD) research in technologies for each missile defense phase encompassing the entire engagement sequence to include Surveillance, Acquisition and Tracking, Discrimination, Communications, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, Evolving Threats and Countermeasures, and Kill Assessment. The following eight ATI research topic areas pertain to the BMDS in all phases of the missile defense threat scenario: (1) Radar Systems include but are not limited to Integrated System Concepts, Cross Sections and Signatures, Measurements (waveforms, data extraction), Transmit/Receive modules, Signal Processing, Data Visualization, Data Compression, Image Interpretation, and Passive RF Systems (2) Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems include but are not limited to High Energy Lasers, Light Weight/Scalable Fiber, Solid State, Gas and Liquid Phase Lasers, Improved Diode Laser Arrays, Chemical Laser Improvements, High Energy Laser Power Supplies and Thermal Control Systems, Optical Beam Control and Stabilization Technologies, Large Light-weight, Space Qualifiable Optical Telescopes, Optical Beam Combining and Phased Array Concepts, Fast Beam Steering Concepts, Laser Target Acquisition, Pointing and Tracking Concepts, Light-weight LADAR Transmit/receive Subsystems including Light-weight, Efficient Laser Transmitters, Integrated LADAR Optical Systems, High Bandwidth Photon Counting Receiver Arrays and novel LADAR Signal Processing Concepts/algorithms.

If selected for award MDA will request additional technical and detailed cost proposal information as listed in the attached proposal instructions paragraphs 6 and 7. DO NOT SUBMIT THE TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A REQUEST FROM THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOR THIS INFORMATION. The Government may use selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), support contractors, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement. These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. Additionally non-government employees must disclose all applicable corporate organizational conflicts of interest as well as any personal financial conflict. Submission of proposals under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process. The evaluation team will evaluate and make recommendations for award, based on a peer or scientific review process in accordance with FAR 35.016(d) and (e). The primary basis for selecting proposals will utilize the below listed evaluation factors by applying the delineated criteria as follows: EVALUATION FACTORS MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following five technical factors (weighted equally) and a cost evaluation: (1) Scientific and technical excellence of the research and its relevance to MDA goals with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness; (2) The offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; techniques, or unique combinations of these are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (3) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel that are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; (4) Ability of the proposed effort to make progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of the concept in accordance with MDA programmatic needs; (5) Adequacy of management planning and controls; demonstrated ability to deliver results from research projects, on schedule, on or under cost; and Cost will be evaluated against the government's estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed; total evaluated probable cost consists of the government's estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offerors proposals, to include the government's assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, the duplication of previously awarded contracts submitted by the offeror, similar technology efforts pursued elsewhere and other cost related factors. The following criteria will be applied to each factor for evaluation of each offeror&rsquo;s proposal: (1) The scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; (2) The offerors&rsquo; capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (3) The relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk; (4) Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost. No further evaluation criteria will be used. The government intends to evaluate and recommend awards based upon its evaluation of proposals without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit final technical proposal revisions if deemed necessary. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of ATD for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution. White papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive. This BAA will remain open until February 25, 2011 and will be reposted in 2010. Submittals will be accepted on a continual basis throughout the entire period of time the BAA is open. Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award).

Mr. Robert Barnes, MDA/DV; phone: 256-955-7421 has been assigned as the MDA technical point of contact for the HQ0147-09-ATI-BAA. Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission is encouraged and allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the renovation of the Major General Emmett J. Bean Federal Center in Lawrence, Indiana.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The Bean Federal Center is being renovated to meet the needs of its various tenants which include Defense Finance and Accounting Service and numerous other agencies within the Department of Defense. Among the many changes to the 1.6 million square foot building will be the construction of a new fa&ccedil;ade, upgraded interior and exterior spaces, and the installation of a photovoltaic roof system to improve energy efficiency. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">GSA generally allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs for new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The art budget for the Bean Federal Center project is currently estimated to be $285,000 but could include additional funds depending on Congressional allocation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artists Registry (Registry).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><a href="http://www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture">www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</a></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the Bean Federal Center in Lawrence, Indiana, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 3:00 PM Eastern Time on November 12<span style="COLOR: black">, 2010.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for the Bean Federal Center project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information, including a price proposal, for the Bean Federal Center project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">GSA has determined that the </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">combined weight of all the technical selection criteria is significantly more important than price.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"> </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead-design architect selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final artist's concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site in Lawrence, Indiana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The design portion of this Art in Architecture opportunity is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and is subject to ARRA reporting requirements.</span></p>

<DESC>1.	What is the rationale for the professional certification and/or accreditation for providing the retreat?    This mitigates risks (physical, psychological, etc) to assure the optimum delivery of transitional recovery  conditions and resources for participants and assure qualified personnel training in this type of service . 
2.	What are the demographics (i.e. age, rank, marital status, socio-economic status)of the women besides the geographical areas they are coming from?     The demographics of the women attendees are unknown at this time. They will be returning female combat  veterans from the National Guard, the Reserve(s), or OEF/OIF
3.	What is your current transition/reentry protocol for female combat vets? The re-entry protocol is handled by the Department of Defense through their (PDRHA) Post Deployment Health Reassessment Services.  As the veterans re-join their community, they may seek assistance from local vet centers. The VA does not have a protocol but offers services as requested through the nationwide vet centers. Readjustment counseling service may be provided at these vet centers, if requested.  It is from this pool of veterans that we will most likely select our participants.
4.	 Are the female vets currently in counseling and/or support groups with the Regional Counseling Services Staff? They will be in group or individual counseling groups within the vet centers or a VA medical center. 
5.	Do we need to fill out a Post Performance Questionnaire? If so, where do we find this? You  develop your own post performance questionnaire for the participants of the retreat based on what you want to accomplish in the retreat agenda.
6.	DO we need to respond directly to E.6 52.252-1 and E.6 52.252-3 of the contract? Yes,  you should address applicable items in 52.212-1 in your offer and complete the information on your company in the Representations and Certifications' to verify information on your company.

<DESC>This RFI is amended to provide answers to questions that were posed by interested parties.  
1)	Do the raw data sources exist in electronic form (AHAR, PIT, etc)?  
Answer:  The data sources are electronic and those listed are just examples, as we also have our own VA data sources that will need to be tapped, such as HOMES and the Homeless National Registry.

2)	Have any of the prediction algorithms been formulated or is it part of the bid to create the data sources and algorithms?
Answer: The VA does not have those algorithms but those may exist with other Federal Agencies, such as HUD.  It is the intent of the homelessness program within the VA to work on such algorithms and the contractor collaborate with the multiple offices of the homelessness program within the VA (Executive, Director, National level) in tuning those algorithms as the tool needs to be fashioned to obtain results based upon various VA homelessness programs.
3)	Is the VA expecting that the consultant will supply the data to be integrated in the tool, or will the VA supply the data?
Answer:  The VA will supply the data.

<AWARDEE>MEDICAL EVALUATION SPECIALISTS, INC;5700 E 11 MILE RD;WARREN;MI;480911229
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Identify the agency and contracting activity.

This justification and approval is executed by the VA Center for Acquisition Innovation (CAI), Frederick, Maryland, on behalf of US Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), which administers the Compensation & Pension (C&P) Program.   

2.  Nature/description of the action/contract type.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), through the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), administers the Compensation & Pension (C&P) Program for benefits for veterans, their dependents, and their survivors.  Entitlement determinations for disability compensation claims and disability pension claims are made by VBA Rating Veterans Service Representatives (RVSRs) working in VA Regional Offices (VAROs) across the country.  A medical disability examination is a critical piece of evidence for determining the extent of permanent impairment and the dollar benefit a veteran is awarded.

Congress enacted the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1996 (PL 104-275) on October 9, 1996, which authorized VA to conduct a limited pilot program to contract for MDEs from non-VA medical sources.  Under PL 108-183, Section 704, Congress granted VA temporary authority to contract out for MDEs, which is in addition to the authority provided in PL 104-275.

The VA, issued Contract No. VA101(049A3)-P-0304 to retain a contractor to perform MDEs under PL 108-183.  The contract's period of performance is May 2, 2008, through November 1, 2010, and is valued at $37,155,333.00. Contract No. VA101(049A3)-P-0304 expires on November 1, 2010, at the same time current PL 108-183 expires. However, PL 108-183 was extended through December 31, 2012 on October 13, 2010.  The Government intends to negotiate a six-month bridge contract and three two-month options with the current PL 108-183 contractor to provide MDEs for the following ROs currently being serviced under  VA101(049A3)-P-0304 : 

1.	Cleveland, Ohio
2.	Des Moines, Iowa
3.	Denver, Colorado
4.	Indianapolis, Indiana
5.	Lincoln, Nebraska
6.	St. Louis, Missouri
7.	Waco, Texas
8.	Honolulu, Hawaii (NOTE:  This location is not currently under VA101(049A3)-P-0304; however, the services that will be provided will be exactly the same as those provided under VA101(049A3)-P-0304. Additionally, PL 108-183 does not limit the number of ROs that may be serviced. Finally, the current contractor, MES, already has a provider network in place in Honolulu that will enable them to begin services immediately similar to the other seven ROs being serviced.)

3.  Description of Services

The six-month bridge contract will continue to provide the following services at each of the ROs listed above.  Note that quantities to be ordered are based on Veteran demand and can only be estimated.  Services ordered under the contract are limited to the ROs listed above and the budget for these services will be spread across the ROs based on program office demand forecasts.

This bridge contract shall be placed in anticipation of the award of a more permanent, longer term fixed price IDIQ contract that will extend the Medical Disability Examination support services through the year 2014.  

Anticipated performance start date for the bridge contract is November 2, 2010 and the anticipated performance start date for the longer term, more permanent IDIQ contract is expected to be May 1, 2011.  In order to meet mission requirements, the bridge contract will be issued for a period of six months with three two-month options.  The base performance period is November 2, 2010 through April 30, 2011.  This will allow time to create, compete, negotiate, and award a new IDIQ contract which must be implemented prior to May 1, 2011, to avoid a lapse in services.

4.  Identification of statutory authority.

The incumbent contractor will continue the support services currently provided through a fixed-price competitively awarded contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. Â§ 253(c)(1), the services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  

5.  Demonstration of contractors' unique qualifications.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 08 IDIQ contract was awarded for performance beginning April 1, 2008 and MES Solutions was the successful offeror.  The services performed by the contractor were awarded via competitive procedures that afforded numerous companies the opportunity to submit proposals.

The VA has a contract in place for services related to Public Law (P.L.) 108-183, but the contract expires on November 1, 2010.  P.L. 108-183 was set to expire on December 31, 2010;  however, Congress recently extended P.L. 108-183, but the extension was not signed until October  13, 2010 which gives the VA only 18 calendar days to award a relatively complex contract.  Based on the current contract, and competitive proposals received from a number of vendors, the industry standard minimum start-up period is approximately 90-days, due to the complexity of coordinating services between eight different locations through the United States, as well as the high level of information technology coordination and information security issues that must be in place before performance can begin.  Awarding a new contract to a new vendor would not allow sufficient time for the vendor to sufficiently meet this start-up period prior to expiration of the current contract, which greatly increases the risk of unsuccessful performance. The contracting officer recommends a six-month bridge contract be awarded to the existing IDIQ contractor in order to establish stop-gap measures to provide the required services to meet the existing mission of VBA Medical Disability Examination (MDE) program.  

MES Solutions currently has the personnel in place and is in a good position to meet the additional six-month requirement without the need for meeting the 90-day start-up period.  No other contractors will be able to recruit, obtain credentialing (applicable to Medical Examiners), coordinate the IT and information security requirements with all eight VA facilities, or have their employees in place by the November 2, 2010 performance start in order to avoid a lapse in service.


6.  Federal Business Opportunities announcement/potential sources.

Since there were no provisions incorporated into the current contracts to continue past November 1, 2010 and in order to meet the requirements of FAR Part 5, a notice of "Intent to Procure via Sole Source" shall be published in the Federal Business Opportunities.  
 
7.  Determination of fair and reasonable costs.

The contracting officer does not expect escalation of the hourly rates because the term of this contract, including all options, is 12 months.  However, a price fair and reasonableness determination will be made by comparing the results of the market survey (see Paragraph 8, below) with the price proposal received from the incumbent contractor.   

8.  Description of market survey.

The VA's Center for Acquisition Innovation, located in Frederick, Maryland reviewed market conditions by taking the average estimated unit cost for each CLIN for all locations included in this contract.  The information listed below will be used to determine price reasonableness.
 
RO	IGCE for Base Period + All Options
Cleveland, Ohio
	$5,049,535.00

Des Moines, Iowa
	$952,500.00

Denver, Colorado
	$3,344,730.00

Honolulu, Hawaii	$1,462,505.00

Indianapolis, Indiana
	$1,736,970.00

Lincoln, Nebraska
	$1,207,370.00

St. Louis, Missouri
	$4,366,035.00

Waco, Texas
	$4,887,735.00

Total	$23,007,380.00


 
9.  Any other supporting facts.

None.

10.  Listing of interested sources.  

The incumbent contractor, Medical Evaluation Specialists, Inc./MES Solutions, is the only known source that is able to meet this short-fused, short-timeframe requirement for the reasons listed in Paragraph 5, above.

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition.

The services in the six-month bridge contracts are included as the minimum requirements within Solicitation VA798-11-RP-0002 and shall be placed under Task Orders when the IDIQ contract is awarded.  The longer term, more permanent contract for these services will be subsequently solicited and awarded under the basis of full and open competition.

Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition
1.	 Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 4, Louis A. Johnson VAMC

2.	 Description of Action:  Notice of other than full and open competition for the procurement of Gore Viabahn Endoprosthesis. 
3.	Description of Supplies or Services:   The GOREÂ® VIABAHNÂ® Endoprosthesis is constructed with a durable, reinforced, biocompatible, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) liner attached to an external nitinol stent structure. The flexibility of the GOREÂ® VIABAHNÂ® Endoprosthesis enables it to traverse tortuous areas of the SFA and conform closely to the complex anatomy of the artery. W. L. Gore & Associates has now added a heparin-bonded surface to the GOREÂ® VIABAHNÂ® Endoprosthesis.

4.	Statement of the Facts Justifying Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The basis for the justification is the criteria implemented in the FAR part 6.302-2 unusual and compelling urgency. Items needed for a patient going into surgery the following day. 


5.	Statement Describing the Market Research used to Determine the Availability of Other Resources:  The GOREÂ® VIABAHNÂ® Endoprosthesis with Heparin Bioactive Surface is the only device of its kind approved for both the SFA and iliac artery

6.	Statement Supporting a Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  Products were at catalog list price.
