Plus 1 Module ** (4040-00) single power supply will be returned to JALI Medical after the upgrade is delivered. This requirement will include the following characteristics: 
Product Description
Purchase of the upgrade to the Super Rapid2 Plus1 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Unit, with D702 Coil-Double 70mm2 Coil and Stand with Clamp. This is a system designed to produce safe, high frequency non-invasive brain stimulation. The system has been approved for use on human subjects involved in this clinical protocol at the VA Boston Geriatric Center's (GRECC-IRB#2657)

Salient Characteristics
This type of high frequency stimulation is believed to be more effective, more tolerable to patients.
This type of stimulation results in equivalent or even lower rate of mild adverse symptoms, such as headache.

<DESC>The VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements with Bio Fire Diagnostics Inc. for the purchase of three units of Bio-Fire Array analyzers. These analyzers can detect up to 20 respiratory pathogens and will be of great use for the care of patients and the treatment they will receive. This requirement will include the following characteristics: 
Product Description
Presently, patient and providers are offered a test which can separate only flu A and Flu B. patients may come in demonstrating flu like symptoms. The present test, when positive, makes it easy for the doctor to offer proper care and treatment to the patients. Other patients, demonstrating the same flu like symptoms, may come out negative for the present test because it cannot detect as many pathogens. These patients may not get the proper care they need. The bio Fire film array can detect many more pathogens and the doctors can obtain a better diagnosis and treat the patient accordingly.

Salient Characteristics
The Bio-Fire Film Array is a unique multiplex PCR system for the diagnosis of 20 respiratory pathogens (17 viruses and 3 bacteria) in one hour from appropriate respiratory samples. BioFire is the only company that makes such equipment at this time. The system consists of the Film Array instruments and unique pouches for the samples. They are a sole source for both the instruments and the pouches. This system will be used for the rapid diagnosis of pneumonia and other respiratory illness. This will benefit our veterans, influence patient management and aid infection control/prevention decisions.

This requirement will include the following characteristics: 
Product Description
The Neuroimaging Research for Veterans Center (NERV) has a need for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatible diagnostic pedal cardio stepper, a control unit, basic platform to support the implementation of this piece of equipment in the MRI environment. 

Salient Characteristics
The Ergospect cardio, platform, and control unit is the only highly specialized system that we are aware of that can elicit an appropriate exercise stimulus during brain imaging and is MRI compatible within a 3 Tesla MRI environment, such as the one at VABHS. This equipment represents a major system upgrade to the type of research that can be completed within the MRI environment, and is highly relevant for a broad range of MRI researchers including neuroscientists, neurologists, psychiatrists, cardiologists and physiologists. The system cannot be duplicated with internal VA resources and any attempt to replicate this equipment would require a substantial amount of time resulting in unacceptable delays to our research program. These systems are custom made. We completed web searches for manufacturers of suitable MRI-compatible equipment that would meet our needs. Furthermore, we reached out to researchers at other facilities to attempt to identify available sources of equipment, who also pointed to ErgoSpect as a provider of an MRI-compatible exercise system that would meet our needs

<CONTACT>Ronald Gallihugh, Phone 571-227-2402, Email ronald.gallihugh@dhs.gov
<DESC>From Mr. John Sanders, Chief Technology Officer and Assistant Administrator for Security Capabilities:<br /><br />On June 28th, I released the 2013-2016 Office of Security Capabilities Strategic Plan. This plan was developed in close collaboration with stakeholders from TSA, the Department of Homeland Security, and industry through representatives from the Airport Consultants Council, American Association of Airport Executives, Security Manufacturers Coalition, and Washington Homeland Security Roundtable. As OSC begins to implement this strategic plan, we intend to continue this collaboration since we will not be successful without the partnership of our stakeholders. <br /><br />This strategic plan serves as a framework to align current initiatives, drive future projects to common goals, and guide prioritization of efforts as resources become constrained. Our strategy is complimented by the Research and Development Test &amp; Evaluation Strategy developed in partnership with the DHS Science &amp; Technology Directorate, as well as the OSC Strategic Workforce Plan. The workforce plan is especially important because in order to accomplish the goals outlined in this strategic plan we need a technically and professionally diverse workforce that excels in team environments, engages in proactive and innovative problem solving, and quickly delivers security capabilities to the field that mitigate new and evolving risks.<br /><br />When securing the Nation's transportation systems against an adaptive adversary, success will ultimately be measured by our ability to respond quickly and effectively to changes in our environment. As such, this plan focuses not on the deployment of any single capability but rather growing our organizational capacity to analyze the risk environment, make data-driven decisions, and collaborate with key partners to deliver critical mission capabilities to the field. Key stakeholders also thought it was important to provide clear direction on areas where OSC should focus in the next three years and implement actionable goals/initiatives to take the organization to the next level.<br /><br />Through the above referenced groups and outreach opportunities, I will discuss the plan, initiatives, and timelines with industry. These opportunities will be posted at fedbizopps.gov in the near future. I look forward to the meaningful dialogue on industry's role in effective implementation.<br />

<p>The FDA, National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), Jefferson, AR has a requirement for Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Toxicants in NHPs (Rhesus Macaques of Indian Origin).</p>
<p>As part of these analyses, the NCTR has the need to conduct the following experiments described in the Objectives section below.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>Animal requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor shall supply sixteen (16) nulliparous or sixteen (16) primiparous female Rhesus macaques monkeys of Indian origin. The animals shall be drug na&iuml;ve (with the exception of anesthesia), between the ages of 3 and 5 years old, weigh between 6.0 and 7.5 kg, and demonstrate fertility by evidence of continued estrous cycles for at least six (6) months. The animals shall be conditioned prior to the initiation of the study such that dosing and blood collection may be accomplished without the use of anesthesia.</p>
<p>In addition to the requirements above, the following health requirements for the test subjects shall be met:<br />(1) All monkeys shall test negative for the following pathogens within one-to-two months prior to the initiation of the study: (1) Tuberculosis; (2) Cercopithecine herpes virus 1 (B virus); (3) SRV/D (Simian Retrovirus type D); (4) SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus); (5) STLV-1 (Simian T-Lymphotropic Virus-1). <br />(2) All monkeys shall either (1) have been vaccinated against measles as a juvenile or (2) be vaccinated against measles within one-to-two months prior to the initiation of the study.<br />(3) All monkeys shall be examined by a licensed Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM), experienced in NHP medicine and surgery, and found to be in good health within one month prior to the initiation of the study.<br />(4) Health records and documentation of testing/treatment for all monkeys shall be provided to the NCTR Attending DVM before the initiation of the study.<br />(5) Monkeys shall be tested for Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and helminth &amp; pathogenic protozoal parasites within one month prior to the initiation of the study. Treatment regimens for any monkeys testing positive for these organisms shall be discussed with the Principal Investigator (PI) before initiation of treatment.</p>
<p>Animal facilities:</p>
<p>The animals shall be maintained in a US-based facility that is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). Further, the contractor shall supply the NCTR Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) with a copy of the contractor's internal IACUC approved protocol with signatures.</p>
<p>Test Article:</p>
<p>The test article will be purchased by NCTR as will the vehicle for both the oral and Intravenous (IV) dosing. The test article and the vehicles will be provided to the test facility for use in the study. Using an NCTR-provided procedure, the test article shall be dispersed in the appropriate vehicles at the specified concentrations at the test facility. An aliquot of each dosing solution shall then be shipped to NCTR for dose certification prior to its use. The test facility shall be located in the continental US such that the dose solution samples can be shipped overnight to NCTR by courier within 72 hours of preparation at the test facility. The dose solution samples shall be shipped only after arrangements have been made with the NCTR PI.</p>
<p>Sample collection:</p>
<p>All samples shall be collected into sample collection tubes provided to the test facility by the NCTR. Approximately 300 - 500 &micro;l (&plusmn; 10%) of blood shall be collected per time point. After blood collection, each blood tube shall be inverted several times as prescribed by the tube manufacturer and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1,300 g (or as indicated on the tube/packing) in order to separate plasma. Plasma from each tube/sample (approximately 100 - 150&micro;l) shall be transferred into pre-labeled cryotubes provided to the test facility by NCTR and stored frozen until shipping. The frozen samples shall be stored under conditions whereby the samples are continuously maintained in the frozen state. The frozen samples shall be shipped to NCTR in dry ice by overnight courier no more than 45 days after collection. The plasma samples shall be shipped only after arrangements have been made with the NCTR PI.</p>
<p>Experimental Design:</p>
<p>In addition to the experiments described below, the test subjects shall be weighed weekly during the experiment and the data forwarded to the PI at the end of Experiment 1 and at the end of Experiment 2. The number of biscuits consumed on a daily basis shall also be recorded and the data forwarded to the PI at the end of Experiment 1 and at the end of Experiment 2. A log of the precise times (to the nearest minute) of the test article administrations and blood collections shall be provided to NCTR with each set of samples.</p>
