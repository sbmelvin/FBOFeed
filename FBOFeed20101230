<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>*** THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS ***<BR><BR>Description of Work:  The U.S Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, is seeking industry input for structural systems to develop a training wall feature for the Mile Point Navigation Improvements project.  The purpose of the RFI is to gather industry-wide feedback on alternative materials and/or systems that have been developed and used for coastal and river structures similar to the currently presented stone training wall structure.  <BR><BR>A 4,250 LF training wall is to be located on the south shoreline of the St. John River and west of the confluence of the Intracoastal Waterway (IWW).  The functions of the training wall are to train river currents along the channel; it also serves as containment for approximately 50 acres of high and low marsh to be created behind the structure and serves as an on-going shoreline protection feature to prevent loss of the newly created marsh.  Dredge material placement will be to elevation +2 Feet MLLW on the protected side of the structure.  Proposed training wall systems will need to promote tidal exchanges hydrating and draining the new salt marsh, and should also promote favorable oyster and fish habitat deliveries for a 3.9 Foot mean tide range using openings or windows.  The systems will be required to resist loads for final dredge material placed at elevation +2 Feet MLLW with a base elevation at -3 to -2 Feet MLLW, while resisting overturning and sliding for described conditions.  Approximate dredge slurry maximum elevation may achieve +3 Feet MLLW.  Maximum river current velocity is 5 Feet/Second.  Systems must deliver shoreline protection for wind and wave conditions with a design wave height of 5 Feet.  Top of structure is required at elevation of not less than +7.5 Feet MLLW.  The proposed system should be expected to perform with minimum operational maintenance and repair, and should remain structurally stable for a service period of 75 to 100 years.<BR><BR>The intent of this RFI is to identify for future consideration alternative training wall structures using systems with materials other than natural stone with a 165 PCF weight.  Foundation grading and placement of the foundation-filter stone base will be performed by the Prime contractor such that existing bottom of structures will be established to between -3 and -2 Feet MLLW prior to structure placement.  The stone foundation will extend not less than 10 feet beyond the base of proposed structures on the river side and will require a vertical filter stone to elevation +2 Feet on the marsh side.  Additional detailed descriptions, dimensions and elevations for the training wall are provided on project drawings.  Drawings provided are "Preliminary Draft", and are not intended for solicitation or pricing purposes.  The current stone training wall plan and section is provided for information only.<BR><BR>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), or promise to issue an RFP in the immediate future.  This is a market research to determine whether there is interest and capabilities to design and provide a structurally stable materials and/or system that will perform the described functions identified within the description of work.  Invitations for presentations may be extended to further communicate the capabilities and performance deliveries of proposed systems.  The Government may not make a selection of acceptable systems at this time, as the determination of acceptable systems will continue during development of final project design documents.<BR><BR>Interested parties are requested to submit capability statements, product information, technical approach, installation methods, demonstrated experience where proposed systems have been successfully used before, and any other pertinent information to Beau Corbett of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District.  Mr. Corbett can be reached at (904) 232-1388, and by e-mail at beau.corbett@us.army.mil.  Submission of information via e-mail is the preferred method; however, hard copies can also be mailed to Mr. Corbett's attention at 701 San Marco Blvd, Jacksonville, FL 32207.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

1.  Background: In 1992, VA, through a contract with the West Virginia Medical Institute, Inc. (WVMI), developed explicit criteria to be used to review care.  These criteria were largely developed by leading clinicians in healthcare and were intended to represent state-of-the-art practice in the community.  With the assistance of Dr. Donald Berwick and his staff at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and in collaboration with VA clinicians, these criteria were followed by fundamental clinical practice guidelines for rehabilitation of patients following a stroke or lower extremity amputation. VHA's first endeavor to integrate evidence into the development of clinical practice guidelines was realized in the pioneering work of Dr. Karl Hammermeister who developed the CARE Guide RT for Ischemic Heart Disease that was published in September 1996. 

 Shortly thereafter, VA's contract with WVMI was modified to clearly address VA's "Prescription for Change" which stated, "VA will standardize clinical processes (e.g., with nationally developed clinical guidelines)" 

In 1998, the Department of Defense and VA partnered to advise the DoD/VA Executive Council on the use of practice guidelines to improve the quality of health and support population health management across both Departments.  The VA/DoD Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) Work Group was established to:
a.	Advise the Executive Council regarding the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines.
b.	Identify areas for clinical practice guideline adaptation based on the operationally defined needs of VA and the DoD.
c.	Facilitate the federal guideline adaptation process.

2.  Scope: VHA wishes to enter into a contractual agreement with an organization that has a proven track record for medical meeting documentation support and document development, editing and production.  Optimally, the organization would have clinical practice guideline or evidence synthesis development and meeting support expertise.  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the requirements of the SOW.  The purpose of this solicitation is to establish and operate a contracted system to assist the Offices of Quality and Performance (OQP) as well as the Chief, Quality Management Division, United States Army Medical Command (USAMEDCOM) and clinicians in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense (DoD) develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.  Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines will be used to:

a.	Reduce variation and ensure predictable quality of care and resource utilization;

b.	Reduce errors and ensure the safety of the care provided; and

c.	Promote accountability to the optimum standard of care based on the most current state of scientific knowledge.

A key element in the development of evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines is iterative editing and document preparation to ensure that the final CPG reflects the evidence presented and consensus of the clinical experts when there is insufficient evidence.
Contractor shall be required to produce written materials necessary to document the guideline development process, culminating in the production of a full clinical practice guidelines (CPG) including algorithms, recommendations, evidence tables, bibliographies, appendices, as well as a CPG summary, CPG provider reference tools (such as Pocket Cards), and CPG metrics.  All in a format established by the VA/DoD Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline (VA/DoD EBCPG) Work Group.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

1.  Background: In 1992, VA, through a contract with the West Virginia Medical Institute, Inc. (WVMI), developed explicit criteria to be used to review care.  These criteria were largely developed by leading clinicians in healthcare and were intended to represent state-of-the-art practice in the community.  With the assistance of Dr. Donald Berwick and his staff at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and in collaboration with VA clinicians, these criteria were followed by fundamental clinical practice guidelines for rehabilitation of patients following a stroke or lower extremity amputation. VHA's first endeavor to integrate evidence into the development of clinical practice guidelines was realized in the pioneering work of Dr. Karl Hammermeister who developed the CARE Guide RT for Ischemic Heart Disease that was published in September 1996. 

 Shortly thereafter, VA's contract with WVMI was modified to clearly address VA's "Prescription for Change" which stated, "VA will standardize clinical processes (e.g., with nationally developed clinical guidelines)" 

In 1998, the Department of Defense and VA partnered to advise the DoD/VA Executive Council on the use of practice guidelines to improve the quality of health and support population health management across both Departments.  The VA/DoD Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) Work Group was established to:
a.	Advise the Executive Council regarding the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines.
b.	Identify areas for clinical practice guideline adaptation based on the operationally defined needs of VA and the DoD.
c.	Facilitate the federal guideline adaptation process.
d.	Identify a maintenance process for fielded VA/DoD guidelines that monitors the development of new technologies/practices/pharmacotherapy that should be incorporated into the guidelines to keep them current.
e.	Champion the integration of clinical practice guidelines into current and developing information systems to further optimize guideline implementation.
f.	Ensure integration of practice guidelines with existing VA/DoD health promotion, disease prevention, and wellness initiatives.
g.	Encourage research related to practice guidelines within VA/DoD. 
VA and DoD have collectively produced the following evidence-based clinical practice guidelines:

2.  Scope: The Department of Veterans Affairs National Energy Business Center (VA-NEBC) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement to locate that has the capability of developing evidence syntheses to support guideline development. The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the requirements of the statement of work.  The purpose of the solicitation will be to establish and operate a contracted system to assist the Offices of Quality and Performance (OQP) and Patient Care Services as well as the Chief, Quality Management Division, United States Army Medical Command (USAMEDCOM) and clinicians in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense (DoD) develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.  Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines will be used to:

a.	Reduce variation and ensure predictable quality of care and resource utilization;
b.	Reduce errors and ensure the safety of the care provided; and
c.	Promote accountability to the optimum standard of care based on the most current state of scientific knowledge.

The starting point and key element in the development of evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines is evidence-synthesis.  Evidence synthesis is systematic reviews which critically appraise, summarize, and synthesize the best evidence to explain differences among research studies on specific clinical questions.

Because this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  No solicitation exists. Therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business, SDVOSB, VOSB or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.

3. SUBMITTAL INFORMATION:

2.  Scope: The Department of Veterans Affairs National Energy Business Center (VA-NEBC) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement to locate that has a proven track record facilitating the development of clinical practice guidelines. The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the requirements of the statement of work.  The purpose of the solicitation will be to establish and operate a contracted system to assist the Offices of Quality and Performance (OQP) and Patient Care Services as well as the Chief, Quality Management Division, United States Army Medical Command (USAMEDCOM) and clinicians in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense (DoD) develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.

b.	Reduce errors and ensure the safety of the care provided; and
c.	Promote accountability to the optimum standard of care based on the most current state of scientific knowledge.

A critical element throughout the development of evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines is facilitation of the working groups.  Facilitation aids in the review of the evidence and also aids in consensus building when evidence is not sufficient to recommend a course of action.  Because this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  No solicitation exists. Therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business, SDVOSB, VOSB or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.

Brand Name Justification
The use of a Brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.
The IRS today has 87 tax processing applications which can run only on Unisys mainframes. The IRS also has 2,260 utility and supporting application programs that were developed to run in a Unisys environment. To function, both the tax processing and supporting applications require a Unisys mainframe operating system, utility, and other support software from Unisys and from four Independent software vendors (ISVs).  Sixty five brand name products were and are needed, and have been licensed from Unisys, and from ISVs through licenses managed by Unisys, over many years.  Without the continued licensing of these products, our 87 tax processing applications would not run as currently developed.

FAR 6.302-1(b)(4) authorizes acquisition of specific brand names When the Agency head has determined in accordance with the agencys standardization program that only specified makes and models of technical equipment and parts will satisfy the agencys needs for additional units or replacement items, and only one source is available.  IRSs current AS-Built Architecture document, lists the 87 tax processing applications mentioned above as running on UNISYS mainframe computers. Therefore the brand name products supporting these applications can be considered de facto standards.  The hardware upgrade will constitute replacement items within the definition and scope of FAR 6.302-1(b)(4).

The end of hardware support for the current UNISYS Dorado 280 mainframe, which will occur on 12/31/2011, would leave the IRS without the guaranteed response time and guaranteed parts replacement that are required for a critical mainframe.

The end of hardware support for the current UNISYS Dorado 280 mainframe, which will occur on 12/31/2011, would leave the IRS without the guaranteed response time and guaranteed parts replacement that are required for a critical mainframe.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Notice Type: <br />Notice of Intent - Sole Source
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Information Technology Library, intends to negotiate with Internet2; Ann Arbor; MI, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to provide the membership described below.</p>
<p>Background: <br />Internet2 is an advanced networking consortium comprising more than 200 U.S. universities in cooperation with 70 leading corporations, 45 government agencies, laboratories and other institutions of higher learning as well as over 50 international partner organizations.<br /><br />Internet2 is the only experimental network in the U.S. for research in networking technologies. All major universities as well as U.S. Government agencies conducting research are connected to this network. In order to access the network, one must be a member of the Internet2 Consortium and have a physical high speed network connection to the backbone network of the Internet2, the Abilene Network, and pay membership and network connection fees. The proposed fiber connection is in place from the NIST Gaithersburg campus to the high speed network provider, Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (MAX), who will in turn connect NIST to the Abilene Network. As no other such network exists, Internet2 is the only alternative.<br /><br />The NAICS Code is 813920. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Internet2 for this requirement. <br /><br />Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST to provide these services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before January 6, 2011 at 4 pm EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov and Barbara Suhrie at Barbara.suhrie@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL NOTICE ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE PROGRAM SUPPORT (PSC) TASK ORDERS.


	The purpose of this program is to maintain a comprehensive understanding and awareness of current and impending innovations and technology trends related to health information technology (HIT). 
	
	An increasingly vibrant industry is developing a range of innovative technological approaches.  Some of these will quickly disappear from the marketplace; others will precipitate modest changes; a few will have revolutionary impact.  One thing in this field is certain: the technology of 2015 will be very different from that available today.  
	
	With the Federal government making multi-billion dollar investments supporting health technology, it is imperative that programs and policies align with and take full advantage of technological advancement.
	
This program will facilitate information exchange between the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), key subject-matter experts, and HIT innovators and developers.  

This exchange will furnish ONC and other HHS agencies, including CMS and AHRQ, with continual updates on the development of the most promising HIT innovations that may support the achievement of meaningful use and the adoption of health IT, as well as key programmatic efforts that will be affected by technological advances. 

This exchange will enable the systematic identification of HIT innovations addressing areas of care delivery where critical problems are not being addressed as well as the early identification of emerging, breakthrough advances that may shape policy and technology initiatives.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>Solicitation # W91LV2DECATURIL is hereby issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for lodging during the period of 7-9 January 2011 in the Decatur, IL area. This procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. Only small businesses under NAICS Code 721110 are being solicited resulting in a COMPETITIVELY awarded purchase order contract. The small business size standard for NAICS code 721110 is $30,000,000 or less. <BR>Note: The small business size standard for Hotels has recently been increased from $7.5 M to $30 M.  All vendors are requested to update their CCR records to reflect any changes that may be necessary to reflect their current size standard. <BR><BR>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide contracted services as set forth below and in the attachments.<BR><BR>The anticipated award will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP)-type contract. Offerors must submit quotes on the full quantity identified. Award shall be made to a single offeror. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to make no award under this procedure.<BR><BR>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>QUOTES MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION.

A redacted copy of the required brand-name justification is included within this announcement.<br /><br />This acquisition is being solicited on an unrestricted basis and the associated NAICS code is 541519 with a SBA size standard of $25,000,000 in average annual receipts.<br /><br />Offerors shall provide a price for each contract line item number (CLIN) in their quote. Quotes with quantities of less than requested or products other than those requested will be deemed technically unacceptable.<br /><br />CLIN Descriptions:<br /><br />CLIN 001: SYMC Netbackup Enterprise Client 7.0 WIN/LNX/SOLX64 1 Server Tier 2 STD LIC GOV BAND S, MPN: 20946082, QTY: 03 EA.<br /><br />CLIN 002: SYMC Netbackup Enterprise Client 7.0 WIN/LNX/SOLX64 1 Server Tier 2 Initial Essential 12 Months GOV BAND S, MPN: 20940399, QTY: 03 EA.<br /><br />CLIN 003: SYMC Netbackup Enterprise Client 7.0 WIN/LNX/SOLX64 1 Server Tier 4 STD LIC GOV BAND S, MPN: 20940552, QTY: 02 EA.<br /><br />CLIN 004: SYMC Netbackup Enterprise Client 7.0 WIN/LNX/SOLX64 1 Server Tier 4 Initial Essential 12 Months GOV BAND S, MPN: 20940555, QTY: 02 EA.<br /><br />Justification: The DLA Logistics Information Service currently utilizes Netbackup software. The current master server has reached its life expectancy and is being replaced. This new enterprise server software is required to continue the backup of client servers and to add 6virtual servers to the backup constellation. Procurement of alternative backup software would require additional procurement of new client software for every server serviced by the master server, and extensive conversion of all existing backup data. Introduction of another manufacturer's software will create a compatibility problem and is not cost effective.<br /><br />Potential offerors shall be Symantec resell partners and shall include documentation verifying their reseller authority to be considered technically acceptable.<br /><br />The evaluation factor(s) for award is; lowest-price, technically acceptable. Any resulting contract or order will be firm-fixed price. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make an award without conducting discussions.<br />Please place "SP4707-11-Q-0018" in the subject field of any correspondence. Questions regarding this RFQ are due by 1/7/2011 at 5:00 PM EST. Responses are due by 1/13/2011 at 5:00 PM EST. Include your Cage code with your quote.

Statement of Work for MRI Cryogen Refill: 
1.	 Delivery of Medical Grade Helium to Fayetteville, AR. VA Medical Center for the Philips Medical 1.5T MRI Unit (Model Achieva 1.5T MRI Magnet) that needs the Cryogen level refilled.
2.	The current Cryogen level is below 50%.  The Cryogen level needs to be bought to at least 90% but no greater than the maximum level that is recommended by the manufacture.
3.	The refilling company will need to know when the maximum level is achieved since no technical assistance from Philips Medical will be on hand during the refill process unless the refilling company coordinates this with Philips Medical ahead of time at their cost.
4.	The refilling company will need to know the specifications of the refill port fittings and will need to know where and how the Cryogen will be put into the MRI Magnet enclosure.
5.	The refilling company will need to be able to transport the Cryogen from their vehicle to the MRI Magnet room.
6.	There will be an MRI operator on hand during the refill process.
7.	The refill process will need to occur during normal business hours Monday through Friday from 8:00am - 4:30pm.
8.	Since the refill process may take several hours the start time should occur so that the vendor will be finished by 4:30pm.
9.	Currently the MRI Magnet is not energized, but all MRI safety precautions need to be observed as if the Magnet was energized.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is N40442-11-T-3010, and it is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-46, effective 29 OCT 2010.</p>
<p>NAICS code 423990 applies. This is a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Military Sealift Fleet Support Command (MSFSC), Norfolk, VA intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order with options for fire extinguisher service in support of the Military Sealift Fleet Support Command Training Center-East in Freehold, New Jersey with the following service:</p>
<p>Location: Military Sealift Fleet Support Training Center East<br />1029 Route 33 East<br />Freehold, New Jersey 07728<br />Tel: (732) 938-4979<br />Fax: (732) 039-4615</p>
<p>1) General Statement:<br />During the course of basic and advanced fire fighting training conducted at the MSFSC Training Center East, each student is required to handle and discharge 15 lb. portable carbon Dioxide (CO2) fire extinguishers and 20 lb. ABC Dry Chemical extinguishers during their practical assessments. The number of extinguishers discharged varies widely based on the proficiency of each student, the number of students in each class and the total number of classes in a year. The estimated monthly average number of fire extinguishers is fifty-seven as a combined total for both types.<br /><br />This Statement of Work is for expended training CO2 and ABC Dry Chemical extinguisher inspection and refill, including round trip handling fees between the MSFSC TC-East and the vendor's facility.</p>
<p>2) Contract Requirements<br />The inspection procedure is broken down as follows:<br />1) Upon receipt at vendor facility, each CO2 cylinder is inspected to verify whether or not it requires hydrostatic testing (fee applies for hydro testing). If the cylinder is out of date, hydrostatic testing is performed. If the cylinder passes, it continues through the inspection and refill process. If the cylinder fails hydrostatic testing it is condemned and removed from service (TC-E notified).<br />2) Cylinders which pass Hydrostatic testing are then inspected for functionality of the discharge valve assembly. If the discharge valve assembly is intact and operating properly, the cylinder is then recharged with CO2 (fee applies for recharge). If the discharge valve assembly is damaged or inoperable, the valve and associated seals/consumables are replaced prior to the cylinder being recharged with CO2 (fee applies for valve, seal and consumables replacement).<br />3) Once each cylinder is recharged with CO2, the cylinder is inspected to see if the discharge safety pin and/or lanyard are still in place. If the pin has been retained, it is reinserted into the discharge valve handle to prevent accidental discharge and secured with a plastic seal indicating the unit recharge is complete and the unit is ready for service. If the safety pin and/or lanyard are missing, a new safety pin and/or lanyard are installed and sealed (fee applies for pin and/or lanyard as needed), indicating that the recharge is complete and the unit is ready for service.<br />4) Regarding the recharge of the 20 lb. ABC Dry Chemical extinguishers, the process outlined above would remain the same with the only variation being the cost of the recharge of ABC agent vice the cost of CO2.</p>
<p>The requested initial period of performance for the above service is 1 February 2011 to 30 September 2011.<br />Option period 1: 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2012<br />Option period 2: 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2013<br />Option period 3: 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014<br />Option period 4: 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)</p>
<p>The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of the end of the period of performance.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)</p>
<p>(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 hours of the end of the period of performance; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.</p>
<p>(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.</p>
<p>(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 60 months.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)<br /><br />FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (DEC 2010) applies to this acquisition and the following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause at paragraphs (b) and (c) are applicable to this acquisition:<br />Paragraph b<br />(1) 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government, (SEP 2006), with Alternate I (OCT 1995)<br />(6) 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interest when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment (DEC 2010)<br />(9) 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set Aside, (JUN 2003) <br />(12) 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, (MAY 2004)<br />(14) 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, (DEC 1996)<br />(20) 52.219-28, Post Award Small Business Program Representation (APR 2009)<br />(21) 52.222-3, Convict Labor, (JUN 2003)<br />(23) 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, (FEB 1999)<br />(24) 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity, (MAR 2007)<br />(25) 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Veterans (SEP 2010)<br />(26) 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, (OCT 2010)<br />(27) 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Veterans, (SEP 2010)<br />(33) 52.223-18, Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving (SEP 2010)<br />(34) 52.225-1, Buy American Act -- Supplies, (FEB 2009)<br />(37) 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases, (JUN 2008)<br />(42) 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration, (OCT 2003)<br />Paragraph c<br />(1) 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) <br />(2) 52.222-42, Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires (May 1989) <br />Engineering Technician, GS-11, $27.80 Hr<br />(3) 52.222-44, Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract Act-Price Adjustment (Sep 2009)<br /><br />No other additional contractual terms and conditions are applicable.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Haiti</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Field Program Manager is a member of the Democracy Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, and is based in Port au Prince, Haiti.</p>
<p>The OTI/Haiti program will further the high priority U.S. policy objective of helping restore stability in Haiti after almost complete destruction of the capital and severe impairment of the Government's ability to communicate effectively - both inter-governmentally and with the Haitian people. USAID/OTI's goal for its engagement in Haiti is supporting the Government of Haiti in the aftermath of unprecedented destruction to the country after the January 12, 2010 earthquake.</p>
<p>The initial objectives for the OTI/Haiti program are: (1) to support the Government of Haiti (GOH) by promoting stability and decreasing the chances of unrest; and (2) to facilitate GOH efforts to restore core government functions.</p>
<p>Currently, illustrative activities include:</p>
<p>Communications: OTI provides support to Government of Haiti (GOH) ministries in coordination with the U.S. Embassy/USAID Mission to assist in the restoration of communications capacities, both external and intra-governmental. OTI provides assistance on generating and disseminating updated information on the recovery efforts and humanitarian assistance. This is critical for stemming unrest and promoting governing stability.</p>
<p>Government Rehabilitation: OTI works with GOH and the U.S. Mission to provide basic infrastructure and supplies that facilitate efforts of the GOH to restore core government functions.</p>
<p>Jobs: OTI establishes a short-term jobs program that will hire local Haitians to remove rubble, repair roads, clean drainage canals, and rehabilitate key infrastructure.</p>
<p>Over time and as the post-earthquake political, social and economic environment changes, OTI expects to adapt its objectives and programming to accordingly.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a qualified individual to serve as a Field Program Manager in support of OTI's programs in Haiti.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Field Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. The Field Program Manager holds a management position primarily responsible for coordinating monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of activities within the overall Haiti program. The Field Program Manager's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight, management and analysis of the OTI country program. The OTI Field Program Manager helps to provide consistent representation to and coordination with the host of offices and organizations active in Haiti's post-earthquake environment.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Delivery shall be no later than 30 calendar days after award date.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #2005-46. A redacted copy of the required brand-name justification is included within this announcement.<br /><br />This acquisition is being solicited on an unrestricted basis and the associated NAICS code is 541519 with a SBA size standard of $25,000,000 in average annual receipts.<br /><br />Offerors shall provide a price for each contract line item number (CLIN) in their quote.

The current master server has reached its life expectancy and is being replaced. This new enterprise server software is required to continue the backup of client servers and to add 6virtual servers to the backup constellation. Procurement of alternative backup software would require additional procurement of new client software for every server serviced by the master server, and extensive conversion of all existing backup data. Introduction of another manufacturer's software will create a compatibility problem and is not cost effective.<br /><br />Potential offerors shall be Symantec resell partners and shall include documentation verifying their reseller authority to be considered technically acceptable.<br /><br />The evaluation factor(s) for award is; lowest-price, technically acceptable.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This project includes the removal of Culvert 14, which is an existing structure located at station 1594+00, north of Culvert 10A and south of Culvert 16. The culvert, constructed in 1935, has a single 10-ft diameter, 96-ft length, corrugated metal pipe barrel, with a lakeside manually operated slide gate, concrete headwalls, and steel sheet pile intake and discharge wing walls. Culvert 14 will be uncovered and removed after installation of a temporary cofferdam that will be the flood protection device in place of the dike during construction activities. After the culvert is removed, the embankment will then be reconstructed to lines and grades consistent with the existing adjacent dike sections (1V:6H lakesides and 1V:4H landside). The specified fill material will be the same as that used for the cofferdam. The fill material is compatible with existing dike soil which will be scarified prior to placement and compaction of the fill material to preclude preferential seepage paths or hydraulic fracture along the interface of the two materials. After the reconstruction of the embankment is complete, the cofferdam will be removed.

<DESC>The base consists of constructing an upland disposal area (IR-2) located in Indian River County, Florida. The disposal area dikes shall be constructed to an elevation of 14.0 ft NAVD 88. The project also includes requirements for clearing and grubbing, fencing, access road construction, weir structures, and slope protection. The dredged material containment basin will be surrounded by a perimeter access road and perimeter ditch. All slopes will be maintained at 3H:1V.  The dikes crest elevation will be 14 ft NAVD and the basins bottom elevation shall be 1.5 ft. All excess material will be stockpiled onsite.  Twin box riser weirs with composite weir boards will be employed for the decant water system. Wetland impact of 1.55 acres will be mitigated for onsite with 5.95 acres making up a small on-site mitigation bank.  9,000 square yards of temporary road stabilization will be constructed.
