Early proposal submission is encouraged</p>
<p>Open Ended BAA Announcement - CB-DPS&amp;A:<br />ASC/XR is announcing to business and academia its intent to solicit proposals under calls issued against this Open-Ended Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). This announcement does not request any proposals at this time. Solicitations (or calls) for proposals will be accomplished via calls for proposals to this BAA which specify specific requirements under the four BAA threads.</p>
<p>The over-arching strategy of the BAA involves the use of this 5-year open-ended BAA which spans the four major capability threads for Development Planning, Intelligence, Emerging Capabilities, and Modeling, Simulation (M&amp;S) Technologies and Analysis. This strategy will provide ASC/XR an acquisition tool with the flexibility to solicit proposals and make awards to develop technologies to meet present and future Air Force needs on a "real-time" basis as ever-changing capability issues are identified.</p>
<p>The BAA will remain "open" for 5 years; however, proposals will only be solicited and accepted during calls. Each call will identify specific topics and contain a common cut-off date for proposal submission. Proposal receipt after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>Calls for proposals (i.e. calls off this BAA) will occur periodically throughout the life of this Open-Ended BAA. Each call will: (1) identify specific technology development or analytical outcome topics within the four major capability threads; (2) identify any changes to the standard evaluation criteria or proposal preparation instructions, (3) contain common cutoff dates for proposal submissions, and (4) specify an anticipated contract type and provide a model contract with tailored terms &amp; conditions.</p>
<p>Interested offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments to calls for proposals, which permit extensions to the proposal submission dates, or otherwise change the requirements of this BAA or its subsequent amendments. Potential offerors are encouraged to register on the FBO site to be automatically notified (via e-mail) of any updates to the CB-DPS&amp;A announcement.</p>
<p>Competition and Small Business Size/NAICS: It is anticipated that calls issued under this BAA will be unrestricted. Small businesses are encouraged to propose on all of the calls. The NAICS code, unless otherwise stated in the BAA amendments, shall be 541710, and the size standard is 500 employees. Proposals submitted shall be in accordance with this BAA and its appropriate amendment(s).</p>
<p>On-line Representations and Certifications: Potential offerors are notified that effective 01 Jan 2005 to be eligible for an award, they must submit annual Electronic Representations and Certifications, otherwise known as On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) via the Business Partner Network (BPN) at http://www.bpn.gov/orca. These FAR level representations and certifications are required in addition to the representations and certifications specific to this acquisition. Before submitting the Electronic Representations and Certifications, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database. On-line registration instructions can be accessed from the DISA CCR home page at http://www.ccr.gov</p>
<p>Type of Contract/Instrument: It is anticipated that a mix of contract types will be used throughout the life of this BAA. The specific type of contract will be issued in each call for proposals. The Air Force reserves the right to make no contract awards or to award a contract or assistance instrument. SAMPLES of model contracts (various types) and CRADA instruments will be loaded to this FBO site as the AF POCs develop them and as calls are issued.</p>
<p>Estimated Program Cost: Each individual call issued under this Open-Ended BAA will provide the anticipated Government funding for that call.</p>
<p>Anticipated Number of Awards: The total number of awards under this Open-Ended BAA is unknown at this time. The number of awards will be determined by each call issued during the 5-year (FY08-FY13) solicitation period of this BAA. A call may result in more than one award.</p>

<p>Full Text Announcement</p>
<p>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: <br />ASC/XR is lead for:</p>
<p>a) Pre-Milestone A/B planning (prior to acquisition program start)<br />b) Providing capability options that are integrated to meet warfighter needs-across Wings/Enterprises, services, and agencies<br />c) Facilitating capability-based planning by developing tools, &amp; processes and executing initiatives<br />d) Provide total life cycle Acquisition Intelligence support<br />ASC/XR requirements are typically for Pre-Milestone A&amp;B analytical products as described in the four BAA threads. Future calls will provide specific definition of the development activity and the timeframe for which the analytical product is required. ASC/XR supports many quick turn activities. With the constrained resource environment, it is important to obligate funds quickly to obtain unique analytical skill sets to meet customer needs for complex analyses in less than one year. The BAA can enable diverse industry inputs and streamline acquisition planning for government and industry alike.<br />1. Statement of Objectives-Description of ASC/XR Capability Threads: The objectives of ASC/XR will be met by technical achievements in the four major capability threads: Development Planning, Intelligence Integration, Emerging Capabilities, and MS&amp;A Technologies &amp; Analysis. <br />ASC/XR is seeking robust analytical inputs in development of capabilities for solving war-fighter needs. The objective of this BAA and future calls will be to enable the rapid formation of analytical and development teams, representing diverse expertise and knowledge, to formulate and conduct innovative strategies to address complex development analytical needs that impact current or projected adversary threats. The scope of the solutions sought may include some or all of the following activities: conceptualize, analyze and assess solution options including research alternatives; design, develop, fabricate and demonstrate prototypes; design, develop and conduct simulations. Proposals must be presented in a way to show compatibility with the relevant warfighting capabilities and environment. <br />ASC/XR has identified four general areas that are envisioned as the development space where projects may be identified. These four thread areas are not intended to be limiting and are provided as guidance to inform Industry and Academia of the broad nature of the collaborative approach being taken and pursued on this Open-Ended BAA. NOTE: The following technical areas/threads are for informational purposes only and are not requests for proposals at this time. Interested offerors should be alert for future calls against this BAA. <br />The four CB-DPS&amp;A threads are summarized below:<br />DEVELOPMENT PLANNING THREAD<br />The majority of XR analytics will be under Development Planning to lay a foundation for what a capability or new "system or System of Systems (S0S) should be. The development planning thread supports Pre Milestone A &amp; B activities from requirements definition through determination of cost-effective solutions. Calls in this thread may involve some or all of the focus areas below (but are not limited to these four):<br />&bull; JCIDS Analysis, Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) &amp; Concept Refinement: This sub-thread uses System Engineering (SE) principles to analyze and identify cost effective material and/or non-material solutions using Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) tenents. During the concept refinement phase, technology insertion and technology transition areas are explored as the capability vs. the affordability trades are analyzed. Tasks may include development of cost estimates using cost models, statistical and Monte Carlo applications and other analytical tools.<br />&bull; Pre-AoA Effectiveness Modeling &amp; Simulation: Tasks include quick turn scenario development and operational mode effectiveness analysis in support of concept decision.<br />&bull; Acquisition Planning: Direct technology and conceptual inputs from industry; Advisory and Assistance Services to provide information, advice, analyses, or recommendations necessary for development not related to a specific platform or hardware procurement (see FAR 2.101); robust market research (MR) and MR documentation that can be used by the AF to increase our knowledge or understanding for effective capability planning (see FAR 35.016(a)) in the formulation of Business Case Analysis (BCA), risk mitigation tasks, and initial acquisition planning documentation.<br />&bull; Capability Options: This sub-thread uses early conceptual design approaches to develop system performance characteristics with accompanying cost, schedule and risk to define material solutions to capability needs. The product from this would provide a system definition at an early, aggregate level with well-understood statistical confidence. Efforts would explore the edges of performance trade space for systems to meet needed capability and assess cost and risk factors for each. Tasks would include consideration of technology maturity to meet program development schedules. Work would likely encompass a full range of engineering disciplines, such as aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, stability &amp; control, weight &amp; balance, avionics, including communications, sensors, power generation, and thermal management. The options provided would perform within the context of the user-defined concept of operations (CONOPS) and operational environment.<br />INTELLIGENCE INTEGRATION THREAD <br />Intelligence integration is a key enabling function throughout the weapon system lifecycle. This thread includes intelligence integration activities early in the lifecycle, primarily prior to Milestone A. Intelligence participation in these early stages is critical to reducing cost, schedule, and performance risk to the program and ensuring that an operationally effective Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plansystem will be delivered to the warfighter. Calls in this thread may involve some or all of the focus areas below (but are not limited to these three):<br />&bull; Analyses: Intelligence is a critical factor in a Functional Solution Analysis (FSA), Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), Evaluation of Alternatives (EOA), and other analyses. The primary task is providing quality, timely input on the approach and alternative development to ensure intelligence is part of the tradespace. Activities include assisting with threats and scenarios selection and concept of employment development, supporting the modeling of friendly Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) forces and adversary forces, reviewing alternatives for intelligence supportability and determining the ability of Intelligence Community (IC) to provide adequate support, and lifecycle costing of intelligence support.</p>
<p>&bull; Requirements Definition: Intelligence contributes to development of the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) which captures the requirement to resolve a specific capability gap. The ICD describes the operational environment in which the capability must be exercised and the manner in which the capability will be employed. The operational environment includes a summary of the current and projected threat capabilities (lethal and non-lethal) to be countered.</p>
<p>&bull; Concept Refinement: Intelligence participates in systems engineering activities during the Concept Refinement phase culminating in Milestone A. This includes integrating intelligence into the technology development strategy, systems engineering plan, test &amp; evaluation strategy, draft Capabilities Development Document (CDD), Initial Technical Review (ITR), Alternative Systems Review (ASR), acquisition plan, source selection plan, request for proposal, and other areas.<br />EMERGING CAPABILITIES THREAD <br />The emerging capabilities thread ensures aeronautical capabilities are properly integrated with capabilities from the other Enterprises to meet war fighters' needs in achieving national military strategic goals through a system-of-systems approach. Studies and analysis in this focus involve some or all of the sub-threads below (but are not limited to these three):<br />&bull; Technology Transition: Focus here is on studies to transition future technologies that increase cross-platform effectiveness and integration to increase mission effectiveness and efficiency. It also encompasses technologies or processes that increase aircraft service life and maintainability.</p>
<p>&bull; Identification of Emerging Technologies: Tasks include identifying those technologies and technology enablers that extend current capabilities, fill in gaps in capabilities or vulnerabilities within the missions AF platforms to include but not limited to sensors, countermeasures, communication, navigation, identification, targeting and bomb damage assessment. Other potential subject areas for emerging capabilities application are <br />capability request for information, the Integrated Capability Risk Review Assessment, airborne network, and architecture development.</p>
<p>&bull; Gap Assessment &amp; Analysis: Gap Assessment &amp; Analysis studies will be needed to evaluate and appraise present and future AF mission effectiveness for any of the AF CONOPS: global strike, global persistent attack, space &amp; C4I, global mobility, homeland security, nuclear response, agile combat support; or capability areas of the kill chain.<br />MODELING &amp; SIMULATION (M&amp;S) TECHNOLOGIES &amp; ANALYSIS THREAD <br />The objectives of ASC/XRA will be met by technical achievements in the three major technology focus areas of:</p>

<p>l. Item Identification and Valuation: Any contract award resulting from this solicitation may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (JUN 2005) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 Policy for Valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 Policy for Valuation, "The Government's unit acquisition cost is the Contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the Government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (Per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the Government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee). If you have questions regarding the Unique Item Identification requirements, please contact the Contracting Point of Contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/uid/index.html.</p>
<p>m. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers: The following guidance is provided for Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) contemplating submitting a proposal, as either a prime or subcontractor, against this BAA. FAR 35.017-1(c)(4) prohibits an FFRDC from competing with any non-FFRDC concern in response to a Federal agency request for proposal for other than the operation of an FFRDC (with exceptions stated in DFARS 235.017-1(c)(4)). There is no regulation prohibiting an FFRDC from responding to a solicitation. However, the FFRDC's sponsoring agency must first make a <br />determination that the effort being proposed falls within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special competency of the FFRDC, and that determination must be included in the FFRDC's proposal. In addition, the non-sponsoring agency (in this case ASC/XR) must make a determination that the work proposed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with domestic private industry. Only after these determinations are made would a determination be made concerning the FFRDC's eligibility to receive an award.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. Anticipated Award Date: Desired periods of performance will be specified under each call for proposals and an anticipated award date may be given in each call.</p>

<p>b. Technical/Management Proposal:</p>
<p>i. The technical/management volume structure is dependent upon the type of contract/instrument:</p>
<p>(1) Page limits for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract - A two (2) part technical/management proposal is required. Part I of the technical/management proposal shall describe offeror's proposed approach for the entire program and include a Statement of Objective. Part II of the technical/management proposal shall include a separate description of the technical approach for each proposed delivery order. Additionally, a stand-alone Statement of Work for each proposed delivery order must be included.</p>
<p>(2) Page limits for Fixed Price and Cost type contracts or CRADAs -- All technical/management information shall be presented as a single document with the page limit for the technical/management volume to be specified in each call.</p>
<p>ii. Page Limitation: The technical/management volume page limitation is dependent upon the type of contract/instrument. The page limitations are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) ID/IQ type contract - Part I of the technical/management volume (the Basic ID/IQ contract) will be specified in each call. Part II of the technical/management volume (Individual Delivery Order(s)) will also be specified in each call.</p>

The business section should contain all business aspects of the proposed contractual or instrument arrangements, such as type of contract/instrument, any exceptions to terms and conditions of the announcement model contract, any information not technically related, etc. Provide rationale for exceptions. If selected for negotiations, qualifying offerors may be required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan. Cost proposals have no limitations; however, offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to 20 pages as a goal. The proposal shall be furnished with key activity/milestone schedules and shall contain a person hour breakdown per task. Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry for detailed proposal instructions.</p>
<p>(1) In the event the proposal is for an ID/IQ type contract, the cost section shall contain a separately identifiable and severable cost proposal for each individual delivery order proposed in the technical/management volume. The twenty (20) page cost proposal goal applies to the cost proposal for each individual delivery order proposed. No cost proposal is required for the basic contract.</p>
<p>(2) If proposing a cost type contract, the cost section shall reflect all costs for the effort proposed in the technical/management volume.</p>
<p>ii. Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plans, for efforts anticipated to exceed $550,000, shall be submitted along with the technical and cost proposals. Small business is exempt from this requirement.</p>

Both the Excessive Pass-Through call/solicitation provision and contract clause are in Atch 2 to the BAA or may be found in FAR on Line at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ . Excessive pass-through is currently defined as 70% of the proposed effort.<br />d. Proposal Content Summary: You may be ineligible for award if all requirements of this announcement and the specific call requirements are not met on the proposal due date. Reference Section VIII, for a checklist of the proposal content requirements.</p>
<p>3. Proposal Due Date and Time: Specified in each call for proposals to this announcement. NOTE: Proposal receipt after the due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>4. Two-Step Call/Solicitation Process: The Air Force reserves the right to use a two-step call/solicitation process. If applicable, the call will specify and describe the two-step process, which will normally follow these general guidelines: FIRST STEP solicits a request for an abstract/white paper and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost. These will be evaluated by a government team that will determine which of the abstracts/white papers have the most promise of meeting Air Force needs. Offerors will be notified of the disposition of their abstract/white paper. Those offerors submitting abstracts/white papers assessed as meeting Air Force needs will be asked to submit a technical and cost proposal. Those offerors not requested to submit a technical and cost proposal may, however, still elect to submit a technical and cost proposal. Firms not submitting a white paper are not eligible to submit a proposal. The SECOND STEP consists of offerors submitting a technical and cost proposal within xx days of the proposal request (to be specified with each individual call for proposals). After receipt, proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the award criteria in Section V below. Proposals will be categorized as outlined in Section V.2.a. below and subsequently selected for negotiation. The two-step process will only be used if the call so specifies.</p>
<p>5. Intergovernmental Review: None</p>
<p>6. Funding Restrictions: ASC/XR funds are largely customer funds which may fluctuate greatly over the year. Offerors are advised that funds may become unavailable or change in amount after soliciting a call. Some funds will have specified expenditure rates and offerors will clearly address the estimated expenditure rate to include lead time for subcontractor billing and vouchers.</p>
<p>7. Other Submission Requirements: (Specified in each call for proposals)</p>
<p>a. If by postal mail or hand delivery: Delivery by postal will be accepted if the call so specifies. Delivery by hand will be acceptable if it's delivered to the location specified in the call after calling in advance to make delivery arrangements.</p>
<p>b. If by electronic submission: URL or e-mail address, whether a password is required and a point of contact will be provided to resolve technical difficulties will be specified in each call.<br />V. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION (ONE STEP PROCESS):</p>
<p>The following basis for award requirements may apply in total, or in part, to individual calls for proposals. Each call for proposals under this BAA will detail which basis for award requirements apply and any tailored criteria.</p>
<p>1. Evaluation Criteria: The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's proposal (both technical and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the call.</p>
<p>a. Technical: The technical aspect, which ranks as the first order of priority, shall be evaluated using the criteria shown below. The order of importance of the criteria will be specified in each call. The evaluation criteria to be used will be dependent upon the type of contract/instrument proposed as follows:</p>
<p>i. Cost type contracts including Cost, Cost Sharing, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (Completion), and Cost Plus Incentive/Award Fee and Assistance Instruments:</p>
<p>(1) The proposal must reflect a new and creative solution that clearly demonstrates capability insight and be highly relevant to Air Force needs.<br />(2) Successful development of the proposed effort must have a significant impact on advancing technology for air and/or space power applications.<br />(3) The proposal, including the proposed Statement of Work (SOW), must reflect a sound technical approach.<br />(4) The proposal must indicate that competent experienced engineering, scientific and technical personal are available to support the program and that necessary research/ test/ laboratory facilities are available.<br />(5) The proposal must indicate that the offeror has demonstrated experience with the development proposed.</p>
<p>ii. BASIC ID/IQ Contract:</p>
<p>(1) The proposal must reflect an understanding of the overall technical scope of the technology area.<br />(2) The proposal must reflect a sound technical approach.<br />(3) The proposed concept/idea must have technical merit and be relevant to Air Force needs.<br />(4) The proposal must identify the management and organization of technical personnel and indicate that procedures are available to monitor and control the budget and schedule.</p>
<p>iii. Individual Delivery Orders</p>
<p>(1) The proposal must reflect a new and creative solution that clearly demonstrates technical or scientific merit and be highly relevant to Air Force needs.<br />(2) The proposal must reflect a sound technical approach.<br />(3) The proposal must indicate that competent experienced engineering, scientific and technical personal are available to support the program and that necessary research/ test/ laboratory facilities are available.<br />(4) The proposed Statement of Work (SOW) must be clear, well organized and reflect that the offeror understands the scope of the technical effort.<br />(5) The proposal must indicate that the offeror has demonstrated experience with the technology to be developed.</p>
<p>b. Cost/Price: Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles. Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the second order of priority.</p>
<p>c. Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk will be individually assessed for the technical and cost [select applicable risk factors] areas. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff.</p>
<p>2. Review and Selection Process:</p>
<p>a. Categories: The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>i. Category I: Proposal is well conceived, analytically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are determined to be acceptable, but will be recommended for award based upon availability of funds. They are normally displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br />ii. Category II: Proposal is analytically or technically sound, but requires further development, and may be recommended for award based upon availability of funds, but at a lower priority than Category I.<br />iii. Category III: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs and will not be awarded a contract.</p>
<p>b. No other evaluation criteria will be used. The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award of a contract or CRADA instrument any, all, part or none of the proposal(s) received. Award of a CRADA in lieu of a contract will be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. Award Notices: Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award, by letter or e-mail, on or about the date specified in each call. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract or assistance instrument is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.</p>
<p>2. Administrative Requirements: See I.4.a., c., &amp; d.</p>
<p>3. Reporting: The following CDRLs will generally apply. However, CDRLs may be added, eliminated or modified depending on the offeror's Statement of Work and the requirements of each individual call</p>

<p>The contractor shall provide design/layout, delivery, and installation of all equipment needed to support the Battle Staff room, Control Center and Alarm Monitor rooms, Conference Room, Classroom and Building Media and Information Systems.</p>
<p><br />The Control Center sources sought will have the following specifications (these specifications are not meant to be definitive, but represent in summary form, the general areas to be supported):</p>
<p>1. General: The unique nature of security force operations require specially designed and installed equipment to make best use of the man hours used. During contingencies three or more major operations may be executed simultaneously, each requiring different procedures and each critical to the base's ability to continue its mission. The below specialty areas require additional furniture and systems acquisitions to enable the SFS to provide optimum support to the base mission. Selection will be based on the submission that best supports Security Force operations.</p>
<p>1.1. Battle Staff (BDOC): Primarily provides oversight for security operations during contingencies. The Commander and staff need access to up to the minute information about contingency situations, current manning, and responding forces so that they can evaluate and direct forces effectively to limit damage to the base mission. A Battle Staff Concept of Operations document is provided in Attachment #1 and submissions should be designed to support the operations outlined in this document. Items listed below are considered operational must haves.<br />1.2. Control Center: The security control center is the nerve center of security force operations, receiving input from the field, synthesizing it for use by the Battle Staff, and enacting orders of the Battle Staff. A Control Center Concept of Operations document is provided in Attachment #2 and submissions should be designed to support the operations outlined in this document. Items listed below are considered operational must haves.<br />1.3. Conference Room: A comprehensive presentation system is desired; video conferencing capability is also desired.<br />1.4. Training Classroom: A comprehensive presentation system that includes a video recording package is needed.<br />1.5. Media and Information System: The building is designed with a number of video screens throughout. A media package that connects these to the base IPTV system and allows us to post crucial information that will page across the screen, keeping security forces informed without the use of multiple bulletin boards placed around the building is needed.</p>
<p>Services Summary:</p>
<p>Room 133: Battle Staff (BDOC)<br />Count Item<br />1 Furniture and systems that support the concept of operations in Attachment 1.<br />1 Video Conference Capabilities.<br />1 At least three workstations within the battle staff room with network access.<br />1 Wireless capability to arrange Control Center video wall feed display from this room.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attachment #1<br />Battle Staff<br />Concept of Operations</p>
<p><br />Battle Staff Room Details:</p>
<p>The Battle Staff is manned by a senior SF member(s) during a contingency or emergency situation. The person(s) working in this room need the ability to monitor all actions being taken by the Security Forces Control Center Operator, yet also be able to conduct their own business uninterrupted. Therefore the best concept is for the battle staff room to overlook the SFCC, separated by windows. Ideally, there would be a doorway between the two rooms and a sliding window at a reasonable location where the SFCC Operator and Battle Staff members could exchange paperwork and information.</p>
<p>Equipment needed is as follows:<br />- STE (1 minimum) for ability to contact outside agencies on a secure line<br />- 1 Desktop computer w/large screen dedicated to GEOBASE or other emergency response tools. Wall mount flat screens are most desirable.<br />- 1 Desktop computer w/large screen dedicated to completing reports, papers, etc., as required based on the situation, wall mount flat screens are most desirable.<br />- 1 Printer.<br />- 1 copy machine (this could be shared with SFCC)<br />- 1 fax machine - better if this one is dedicated to Battle Staff.<br />- Workstations for 3-4 personnel, including desk space, chairs.<br />- Reference library with access to all required checklists, 0Plans, AFIs, etc. <br />- Large base grid map and mapping tools (disks, dry erase markers, etc.) <br />- Large dry erase white board w/supplies<br />- 1 or 2 lockers with emergency response kits/supplies inside them. (Currently we just have this stuff stuck in a corner).<br />- Lighting controls - recessed lighting with dimmers works best<br />- Phone systems with 2-4 lines including direct line to EOC, Command Post, etc. Small area for coffee pot, supplies, microwave.<br />- Ability for Video Tele Conference setup. All required hardware and software will be coordinated with pertinent on base agencies that support this service (COMM).<br />- MacDill Base station- ability to switch frequencies talk to any org on base via base station/handheld radio.<br />- Wall mount flat screen w/cable of IPV hookup for local/national news stations for updated news during catastrophe, national emergency, hurricane evacuation, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attachment #2<br />Security Forces Control Center<br />Concept of Operations</p>
<p><br />Security Forces Control Center (SFCC):</p>
<p>The SFCC is manned by a minimum of two SF members 24 hours, seven days a week. SF Control Center Operator which has full oversight and control of daily operations and the second one being the Alarm Monitor which monitors all alarmed facilities on the installation as well as our Waterside Security Systems. Personnel at the SFCC need full capability to operate uninterrupted while monitoring all actions being taken by all Security Forces posts and patrols as well as surrounding law enforcement agencies. The best concept is to have one oversized workstation for the Control Center Operator (open layout), regular workstation for the Alarm Monitor (open layout) and one additional for patrolmen. SFCC Operator, Alarm Monitor and Battle Staff members could exchange paperwork and information.</p>
<p>Equipment needed is as follows:</p>
<p>Control Center Operator Workstation<br />- Desk Workstation Console. This console is required to be raised on automatic switch to support high operations tempo on major incidents. Everything needs to be accessible to this operator. Will include primary ergonomic chair adjustable to raised or lowered desk and a regular alternate chair for a Control Center Operator Alternate.

FOB Destination shall be Washington, DC 20520 <BR><BR>The Department of State requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, Morgana Digifold - Folder: The system is a totally new technology to finish even the most sensitive of materials. The DigiFold is aimed at the print-on-demand market and handles output from digital color printing systems and heavy cross-grained stocks printed by conventional litho. Fully automated, compact and easy to use, the suction-fed DigiFold is the only automated folder using a creasing rule and matrix with the ability to crease material prior to folding. Unlike scoring, which breaks the surface of the material, the creasing rule and matrix mechanism prevents cracking during the folding process.The DigiFold uses a series of very large diameter fold rollers and a 'flying knife' to gently push the material between the fold rollers. A combination of large diameter rollers and the knife, which is speed matched to the material, helps to reduce the possibility of marking or scratching of the finished work. Unit can be used for perfing, scoring and slitting, but it is not fast and thus not recommended.The DigiFold can be set to operate in three modes: For standard folding configurations it works in set to fold mode where, once the required fold and sheet length have been selected, the units powerful program automatically sets the creasing and folding position. A motorized conveyor establishes the optimum position for stacking the finished work. In set to mode, the operator dials in the creasing and folding positions. This mode is particularly useful where extra creases are needed and allows difficult configurations such as the closed gate to be programmed. The third mode of operation allows the DigiFold to be used as an automated creasing machine from which the creased work is delivered flat.

<DESC>Solicitation 8108-19 seeks On Call (OC) flight services consisting of small (not more than 7,000 pounds approved gross weight), turbine engine, three-passenger seat helicopters to support Department of the Interior, (DOI) bureaus and offices in their transport needs within Hawaii and the Commonwealth Areas of the Pacific.  Contractor services include provisions of small helicopters, pilot(s), fuel, aircraft maintenance support, and all other associated equipment, as prescribed in the Government's solicitation.  Mission activities are for fire management programs, Aerial Capture, Eradication and Tagging of Animals (ACETA), Short-haul and other related resource support and administrative activities.  Contractor(s) must possess a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificate issued under 14 CFR Part 135, 133 and 137.   Aircraft offered must also be carried on the Contractor's list required by 14 CFR Part 135.63 or Operations Specifications Part D, "Aircraft Listing," as appropriate.  The contract period will be from the date of award through September 30, 2009 for the first year, with two option periods that may be exercised at the unilateral discretion of the Government.  Multiple awards are expected to be made.  SPECIAL NOTICE.  THE DOI IS IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING CHANGES ON HOW THEY ACQUIRE SOME AIRCRAFT SERVICES.  A DOI CALL-WHEN-NEEDED (CWN) PROGRAM IS BEING DEVELOPED THAT ENCOMPASSES SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ON CALL (OC) CONTRACTS TO SUPPORT DOI AVIATION PROGRAM NEEDS AND MISSIONS.  THIS SOLICITATION IS ONE OF THOSE ON CALL CONTRACTS. WILDLAND FIRE SUPPORT, ACETA, AND SHORT-HAUL APPROVED SMALL HELICOPTERS WILL NO LONGER BE APPROVED OR UTILIZED UNDER A DOI, AIRCRAFT RENTAL AGREEMENT (ARA) AND MUST BE UNDER AN EXCLUSIVE USE OR ON CALL (OC) CONTRACT IF THE OPERATOR WISHES TO DO BUSINESS WITH DOI FOR THESE ACTIVITIES.  This is the only planned OC small helicopter solicitation that is planned for issuance for the next three years requirements.   If you operate these types of aircraft and are interested in continuing your support to the DOI under DOI procurement systems, you will need to submit a proposal as provided herein and be awarded a contract from the solicitation.  If an individual aviation vendor holds a DOI ARA and the same services can be provided via the on-call helicopter contract, the ARA may be cancelled.  We plan on eliminating duplicate procurements when possible.  It is a requirement that any successful awardee must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award being made.  It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure registration is accurate and valid.  Solicitation information will be available through the FedBizOpps site by searching for 8108-19 and at http://amd.nbc.gov.  This solicitation is set aside for small business concerns. The anticipated issue date of the solicitation is August 1, 2008 with a closing date of August 18, 2008. AFTER READING THE SOLICITATION, questions may be directed to Caroline Wallace, 907-271-4788, or email-Caroline_Wallace@nbc.gov

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), has a requirement to establish multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) for machining of parts in accordance with NIST provided drawings on an as needed basis.
The NCNR, in pursuing its mission to be a world leading facility for neutron scattering research, services a large and diverse group of outside users.  To that end, it seeks to equip its laboratories with state-of-the-art parts that interface with the equipment and machines that are used to perform this research. 

The NCNR designs, builds, operates and maintains a suite of cold and thermal neutron scattering instrumentation used in the conduct of material structure research. The NCNR is under a new expansion directive that will include the construction of a new Guide Hall.  This Guide Hall will house at least four (4) instrument guides.  

During this expansion phase, the NCNR anticipates the need of machined parts and assemblies in quantities that would exceed NIST?s on-site manufacturing capacity.  The BOAs will provide a mechanism for purchasing completed parts, custom-made to satisfy the parameters and specifications provided by the NCNR.  

While these BOAs will be open to all operating units within NIST, the NCNR shall be the primary user.
	
The Government intends to award multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs).  

The period of performance shall be one year from the date of award with four one year option periods.

These BOAs shall be procured using the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.    

The NAICS code for this requirement is 332710 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under RFP number SB1341-08-RP-0004.

THE RFP IS ANTICIPATED FOR RELEASE TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY ON OR ABOUT DECEMBER 21, 2007, AND WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET AT THE ABOVE WEB SITE.  

POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCESSING THE WEB SITE.

The contractor shall deliver all line items to Hollings Marine Laboratory, Charleston, South Carolina, 29412-9112. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by August 15, 2008 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Molecular Imaging Program (MIP) plans to procure on a sole source basis, the Olympus MVX Macro/Stereo Microscope with Olympus America Inc.; 3500 Corporate Parkway; Center Valley, Pennsylvania 18034. 

The supplies herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The purpose of this requirement is for the NCI laboratory to develop new optical imaging methods and probes in the Molecular Imaging program to achieve the goal of developing early diagnosis methods and cure cancer patients. NCI has found a gap between in vivo imaging and microscopic imaging is currently the biggest obstacle. To fill this gap, the NCI plans to develop a stereoscopic microscopy system equipped with a spectral fluorescence camera. The stereoscopic microscopy is state-of-the-art with the narrowest angle of 2 subjective views merge images taken simultaneously with a color camera and a spectral fluorescence camera and the excellent fluorescence detect ability as well as the exchangeability of parts and image files with current microscopic systems BX51 and IX81, made by Olympus America. NCI plans to purchase a MVX stereoscopic microscope. 

Olympus America is the only source of Olympus MVS stereoscopic microscopes in the Mid-Atlantic region. Olympus is required for cross compatibility with other microscopes, cameras, analysis software and accessories. 

PART II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

1.	Statute: 13.106-1 (b)(1) 

(b) Solicitation from a single source.

(2)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).

No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.

The following salient characteristics apply to the Olympus MVX Macro/Stereo Microscope: 

-The MVX body must be of a single optical axis design (Macro) to double the Numerical Aperture for increased resolution and fluorescence sensitivity. This should be a true Macro microscope not a stereomicroscope with an on-axis objective click stop.

The MVX body must accept the MVX tilting trinocular with the ability to switch from single axis maximum resolution macro viewing to standard stereo viewing.  

 -The MVX body must accept the binocular/trinocular head from the upright BX series of microscopes.

- The MVX body with an integrated iris diaphragm to control depth of field for viewing the egg and Microinjector needle in one focal plane.

- The MVX body must be modular to upgrade to fluorescence without having to purchase a different body.

-Flatness of the viewing field is required therefore the main objective should be a planapochromat 1x objective rather then an achromat objective

-Upgradeable to the two positions revolving nosepiece because of the need to exchange objectives without disturbing experiments in progress.

- The two-position nosepiece and optics must retain parfocality when switching.

-The base must be transmitted light Gimbal mirror system with fiber optic light source to minimize heat transfer to the base and specimen damage.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis, an analysis of prediagnostic levels of serum vitamin D metabolites and risks of cancers of the kidney, ovary, endometrium and upper gastro-intestinal tract with Heartland Assays; 2325 N. Loop Dr., Ste. 6300; Ames, IA 50010. 

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 the business size standard is 6.5 M employees.

The period of performance for this procurement is September 1  September 12, 2008.  

The objective of this procurement is an analysis for the measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), a measure of vitamin D status, in 1,141 serum samples from participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial.  These measurements within PLCO samples are being performed as part of a large, multi-study pooling project investigating whether serum levels of 25(OH)D are associated with subsequent risks of four types of cancer (kidney, ovary, endometrium and upper gastro-intestinal tract).  Serum measurements of 25(OH)D from over 5,000 individuals from ten cohort studies will be included in the overall pooling project. Of the 5,000 samples, 1,141 samples are from the PLCO cohort study.

Vitamin D is a dietary fat-soluble prohormone, which can also be generated in the skin on sunlight exposure. 25(OH)D is the primary circulating form of vitamin D  and is considered the best biomarker of vitamin D status.  Experimental evidence that vitamin D inhibits tumor growth and metastatic spread has generated considerable interest in the possibility that this hormone reduces cancer risk in humans.  Most epidemiologic research of 25(OH)D has focused on cancers of the breast, prostate and colon.  However, there is reason to suspect that other, rarer, malignancies may be sensitive to this hormone.  In particular, there is evidence supporting a relationship between vitamin D and cancers of the kidney, ovary, endometrium and upper gastrointestinal tract.  However, no epidemiologic studies to date have directly investigated whether 25(OH)D levels are inversely associated with risk in these rare cancers.  This multi-study pooling project is being conducted to investigate this research question.  Baseline serum 25(OH)D level will be measured in case and control participants.

Heartland Assay has performed these services & similar services for related PLCO projects. The 25(OH)D measurements within PLCO serum samples to be covered by this procurement are being performed as part of a large multi-study pooling project, expected to include measurements from over 5,000 participants from ten different  studies. For scientific comparability, it is critical that the vitamin D assays performed for all studies participating in this pooling project be carried out at the same laboratory. Heartland Assays is the only laboratory known to the NCI that can perform the assays for all of the studies in this pooling project.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement.

 THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), on behalf of  the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) intends to procure on a sole source basis, Human CNV370-Quad DNA Analysis Kits with Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Center Drive, San Diego, California 92121.

 Background:
Title: Genetics and Pathophysiology of familial mediterranean Fever and Related Disorders, (Behcets Disease) 
Protocol Number: 94-AR-0105 
Summary: This study is designed to explore the genetics involved in diseases of intermittent fever, including familial mediterranean fever, TRAPS, hyper-IgD syndrome, and related diseases. 
The following individuals may be eligible for this study: 1) patients 5 years of age and older with known or suspected familial mediterranean fever, TRAPS, hyper-IgD syndrome or related disorders; 2) relatives of these patients; 3) healthy, normal volunteers 18 years of age or older; and 4) healthy patients with gout 18 years of age or older who are taking colchicine.

Illumina Inc., has provided specific Human CNV370-Quad v3.0 DNA Analysis Kit (wg-311-1401 and catalog#wg-311-1403,  for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,  entitled: Genetics and Pathophysiology of familial mediterranean Fever and Related Disorders for  BEHCETS DISEASE under protocol Number: 94-AR-0105. (Since September 2007)

In addition, in order to satisfy the requirements of the Behet's disease protocol and ensure the data generated can be incorporated into an extensive pre-existing datatbase derived using the Human CNV370-Quad DNA Analysis Kits, the proposed project must adhere to the conditions, genomic DNA, the purposed protocol must adhere to the conditions, quality of needed supplies required ofr intergity of experiment.    The purpose of this requirement is to process the next 800 samples of genomic DNA as a continuation our  genome-wide complex  genetics analysis of Behcets disease.  Through this process data is combined with data already collected; therefore, the product and platform cannot be changed. Only the Illumina beadstation automated processing robotics and automated sample scanning, for which this product can be used. Changing variable would disrupt the outcome of the experiment under protocol #94-AR-0105.
Researchers are exploring possible genetic, bacterial, and viral causes of Behet's disease as well as improved drug treatment. For example, genetic studies show strong association of the gene HLA-B51 with the disease, but the exact role of this gene in the development of Behet's is uncertain. Researchers hope to identify genes that increase a person's risk for developing Behet's disease. Studies of these genes and how they work may provide new understanding of the disease and possibly new treatments.
1.	Researchers are also investigating factors in the environment, such as bacteria or viruses, that may trigger Behet's disease. They are particularly interested in whether Streptococcus, the bacterium that causes strep throat, is associated with Behet's disease. Many people with Behet's disease have had several strep infections. In addition, researchers suspect that herpesvirus type 1, a virus that causes cold sores, may be associated with Behet's disease.
Finally, researchers are identifying other medicines to better treat Behet's disease. TNF inhibitors are a class of drugs that reduce joint inflammation by blocking the action of a substance called tumor necrosis factor. Although serious side effects have been reported for TNF inhibitors, they have shown some promise in treating Behet's disease. Examples of TNF inhibitors include etanercept and infliximab. Also, interferon alpha, a protein that helps fight infection, has shown promise in treating Behet's disease. Thalidomide, which is believed to be a TNF inhibitor, appears effective in treating severe mouth sores, but its use is experimental and side effects are a concern. Thalidomide is not used to treat women of childbearing age because it causes severe birth defects.

Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that only Illumina Inc., can perform the requisite services specified herein.
 
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The resulting acquisition will be entered into pursuant to the acquisition authority set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

 The sole source determination is based on the need to continue on-going experiment; changing variable would disrupt the outcome of the experiment.    Therefore an award to any other source is not feasible nor practical. 

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Inquires to this notice,  referencing number NHLBI-PB-(AR)2008-213-RCO may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6128, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Rosie C.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.  National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Sequenom, Inc., 3595 John Hopkins Court, San Diego, California, for the purchase of a Mass Array Compact System.  The purpose of this project is to find a gene or genes related to drug abuse, determine how that gene is affecting the addictive process, and ultimately design new pharmaceutical agents for treatment of drug addiction.  A Sequenom MassARRAY Compact System would allow to search large portions of human, murine, and yeast chromosomes for genes which are involved in drug abuse. The Sequenom MassARRAY Compact System is unique and available solely from Sequenom, Inc.   
	The system must include mass array analyzer compact MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer for separation, detection and characterization of the analyte molecules from SpectroCHIP arrays.
	It must include a SpectroCHIP, which is a small silicon chip of approximately 2-3 cm with an array of sample positions.  The SpectroCHIP (384 configuration) supports automated, high-density mass spectrometry analysis.  Each position on the array should be preloaded with light absorbing crystals (MALDI matrix) that form a matrix with the dispensed sample.
	The system must be a benchtop system with real-time (RT) data acquisition capabilities.
	Sample analysis must be in the 2.5-5 seconds per sample range.
	The system must have the capacity to run 2 SpectroCHIPs per run (384 pads per chip).
	The system must have an integrated camera for sample positioning and barcode reading.
	The system must have an 800 mm linear flight path
	The system must include a MassARRAY RT workstation for real-time data analysis and should include software and real-time digitizer boards, automated alignment and sample calibration, fully automated analysis with smart rastering function for improved sample efficiency, reduced analysis times and highest data quality.  
	The system must include a MassARRAY server for data management with Windows operating system and Oracle.
	The system must include a Compact laser MNL 103-PD

Some of the NIDA, IRP program goals already met include identification of receptors for opiate drugs, along with the neurotransmitters mimicked by these drugs.  An abundant set of monoamine neurotransmitter systems, their receptors and transporters, thought to be sites of action for stimulants, are available for study and genetic manipulation.  It is now known that marijuana and similar drugs also act on specific receptors, and scientists are beginning to understand the ligands and neural circuits on which they act.  The purchase of the Sequenom MassARRAY Compact System will aid in our research in identifying a gene or gene region involved in drug abuse vulnerability. An error free technology is needed to analyze SNPs for both validation as well as for associations between markers and disease.  The accuracy is critical as these markers will be the basis from which the diagnostic industry and pharmaceutical companies will develop both tests as well as define targets to base drug discovery efforts.  Employing a technology which is not 100% accurate is vastly more expensive as duplication of experiments to confirm results is needed and more importantly the patient population in the experiment has to be increased sufficiently to obtain the appropriate power for significance in the experiment.  Increasing the patient population is costly not only as a result of additional genotypes, the process of obtaining samples appropriate to the design of the experiments is both labor intensive and expensive itself.  Mass spectrometry is an exact platform, which measures allele specific products on the basis of mass and is therefore not hindered by the nuances caused by allelic dropout and mismatched hybridization, events that are uncontrollable in a biological system.  Sequenom is the only technology commercially available which provides 100% accurate genotypes using mass spectrometry therefore eliminating the need for duplication of experiments and keeping the sample size to a minimum.  There are various functional specifications that are solely available through the use and license of Sequenom MassARRAY genetic analysis technology.

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<a href="mailto:kreacic.michael@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 813920   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with American Water Works Association (AWWA) for Developing a National Strategic Plan for Emergency Water Supply.
Provisions of the 2002 Bioterrorism Act (42 USC 300i-4(b)) requires EPA to produce a report on  alternative sources of water to include "a review of the methods and means by which alternative supplies of drinking water could be provided in the event of the destruction, impairment or contamination of public water systems." This proposed contract will meet this requirement. The deliverable from this effort is intended to facilitate strategic planning by utilities at the local, state and regional level to prepare for such circumstances and also supplement various Emergency Support Functions (ESF) of the National Response Plan (NRP) that address potable water.
EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with AWWA to write a national strategic plan for emergency water supply. The national strategic plan will include the following tasks: conduct outreach with EPA, sector associations and critical customers; conduct a literature review; conduct regional planning workshops utilizing subject matter experts; produce a National Strategic Plan/Template; conduct dissimilation and Outreach activities to build awareness of the guidance.
The American Water Works Association (AWWA) is the oldest, largest, and most well respected association of water professionals.  There is no other known organization or commercial entity currently engaged in the full range of activities of AWWA and its 65,000 members.  AWWA has a one hundred plus year history of conducting scientific conferences and publishing technical reports in the field of water supply.  The unique aspect of their participation is their ability to draw on their membership in workshops to gain first hand knowledge of the current practice in the water works profession related to emergency planning.  	
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the services conducted by American Water Works Association may submit appropriate documentation within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Michael Kreacic via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email kreacic.michael@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Background:  The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is the Nation's largest civilian mapping agency.  Executive Order 12906 calls for the establishment of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) defined as the technologies, policies, and people necessary to promote sharing of geospatial data throughout all levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors, and the academic community. Circular A-16 provides direction for federal agencies that produce, maintain or use spatial data either directly or indirectly in the fulfillment of their mission. This Circular established a coordinated approach to electronically develop the NSDI and established the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC).  The USGS has responsibility for the FGDC Secretariat Office.  Presently, 13 National level organizations are considered stakeholder groups/members of the FGDC. Through the Fifty States Initiative FGDC has collaborated with 35 state level organizations to move forward on strategic and business planning for the advancement of the NSDI. 
Basic Requirement: 
The USGS, Geospatial Information Office, National Geospatial Programs Office, FGDC would like to contract services that would continue to support the Fifty States Initiative to generate strategic and business plans at the state level and foster new partnerships for the NSDI. A well-coordinated, concerted effort inclusive of the private sector, academia and all levels of government led by the FGDC, is needed to leverage resources, minimize redundancies and collaboratively solve problems to achieve the NSDI vision. Essential for achieving the objectives are a bottom-up approach and partnerships forged to achieve a common goal. Following this approach, the Fifty States Initiative has successfully reached 35 state level organizations. 
The Contactor shall use existing strategic and business planning materials, organize a fifty states kick off meeting/workshop, and mentor states and other entities on NSDI issues. The Contractor shall use an existing model of statewide coordination criteria to measure the progress of the Fifty States Initiative. The program office will provide existing planning materials and the coordination model. In addition, the Contractor shall investigate characteristics of an effective statewide coordination council/office and the activities that must be pursued by these groups to ensure their contributions are meaningful to the NSDI. Equally important, the contractor shall assist FGDC to develop a strategy and plan for broad implementation of the completed strategic and business plans in the states and in the Federal sector.
Important General Requirements:
This procurement anticipated to be a "Request for Quote" (RFQ) and is subject to the provision of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

<DESC> MISSION/REQUIREMENT:   IT Policy and Planning Support Services are required to ensure that all IT investments support MSCs Corporate and Strategic Plans and are vetted through the appropriate IT Governance review and approval processes.  MSCs Command, Control, Communications, and Computer Systems (C4S) Directorate (N6) is required to continually acquire, manage and evaluate MSCs IT investments to effectively report requirements and execute the IT budget.  In order to meet these requirements, the following tasks will be required:  Program Management, 3,000 hours per year, IT Asset Management (ITAM) 6,000 hours per year, Portfolio Management 12,000 hours per year, Budget Execution and Liaison Support 12,000 hours per year and Enterprise Architecture (EA) 12,000 hours per year. 

Program Management support includes the full range of project planning, resource management, risk assessment and mitigation, quality management, change control, and management of project deliverables consistent with industry best practices.  Effective daily and long-term ITAM support assists MSC in quality tracking and reporting of hardware, software, licenses, warranties, service agreements, and support contracts, minimizing costs through product standardization, streamlining administrative processes, and managing the life cycle of an asset.  The ITAM process must assist in forecasting hardware replacement and software, maintenance and subscription renewals and process enhancements must be documented.  Estimated hours per year 3,000. 

Portfolio Management includes a number of activities and processes that allow N6 the means to pre-select, select, prioritize, control and evaluate all IT investments on a continual basis.

Estimated hours per year 12,000. 


Budget Execution and Liaison Support enables N64 to maintain open communications with all stakeholders to facilitate the continual translation of IT requirements into budget input.  Liaison support shall be required with N6s Portfolio Mangers, N6 Division Directors, N6 Project Managers, MSC functional and technical sponsors, and MSCs Program Managers (PMs) to facilitate the collection of resource requirements to support internal and external budget submissions and data calls.  Budget Execution support will require maintaining the IT Investment Portfolio by ensuring all budget information is accurate and current, creating and processing funding packages, processing invoices, creating and maintaining contract files for Portfolio Managers, maintaining and logging monthly accruals and receipts, tracking  IT project expenditures by Portfolio and provide financial status reports, tracking and reporting funding status for shipboard equipment installations, maintaining MSC Program Manager (PM) allocation tables, preparing investment reports on an as needed basis, and perform duties associated with Fiscal Year closeout.  Estimated hours per year 12,000.

All IT investments and acquisitions must comply with Federal laws, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines, the Business Transformation Agency (BTA), the Clinger Cohen Act (CCA) of 1996, and USTC, DON and DOD directives.

The Program Management, IT Asset Management (ITAM), Portfolio Management, and Enterprise Architecture (EA) tasks may be performed both at the contractor site and on site at MSC Headquarters at the Washington Navy Yard.  Contractor personnel will be expected to participate in meetings at the Washington Navy Yard, therefore travel to and from the contractor site will be required on an as needed basis.  The contractor shall be expected to keep abreast of current activities and meetings to ensure that appropriate personnel are on site as needed.  Estimated hours per year 12,000.

The Budget Execution and Liaison Support task will be performed on site at both MSC Headquarters at the Washington Navy Yard and at the MSC Fleet Support Command (MSFSC) in Norfolk, Virginia.

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is the program manager for the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program. Under this program DSCP has awarded multiple contracts to various distributors to supply the Department of Defense and other Government medical treatment facilities (hospitals, clinics, etc.) with medical/surgical supplies. Because these contracts exceed $194,000, the provisions of the Trade Agreement Act (TAA) apply as specified in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 25.4 et seq. and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) 225.401 et seq. 

The TAA requires that Federal government procure only end items manufactured in the United States, Qualifying Countries and Designated Countries.  End items not manufactured in one of these categories are considered to be manufactured in non-designated countries.

 Medical items manufactured in non-designated countries are prohibited from supply under the TAA, unless the DSCP seeks and is granted relief from the requirements of TAA.  Therefore, the DSCP requests your response to this Request for Information (RFI).

The information obtained regarding country of origin for your products will be analyzed to determine whether or not DSCP will seek relief from the requirements of the TAA.

<DESC>This notice constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) as contemplated by FAR 10.002(b)(2)(iii).  

Technical POC:  Dennis Lindell, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office. 200 12th Street South, Suite 1103, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 607-3509.  

AIRCRAFT SURVIVABILITY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT,     
TEST & EVALUATION (RDT&E) PROJECTS

I.  INTRODUCTION:

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office (JASPO) is seeking information about industrys Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) ideas for aircraft survivability. Ideally some of these ideas may be of interest to the Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP) community and result in future JASP projects.  This RFI is being issued prior to our annual project proposal call to US Government (USG) agencies to allow time for coordination between respondents to this RFI and potential FY10 project proposals submitted by USG agencies. 

II.  BACKGROUND:

Originally chartered as the Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Aircraft Survivability (JTCG/AS), the JASP has been actively pursuing technologies to support aircraft survivability and coordinate aircraft related survivability issues between the Services for over 30 years. The JASP is a government funded program reporting to the Office of Secretary of Defense/Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (OSD/DOT&E) and chartered by the Services aviation systems commands.  The day-to-day operation of the JASP is under the direction of the Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office (JASPO).  JASP is a tri-Service program whose mission is to achieve increased affordability, readiness, and effectiveness of aircraft through the joint coordination and development of survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability reduction) technologies and assessment methodologies.   

Annually, JASP issues a call to USG agencies for project ideas (proposals) and funds approximately $3M in new start projects and $6M in continuing projects.  JASP projects typically last 1-3 years and receive between $100-200K per year with a potential maximum funding level of $500K per year.  A key tenant of the JASP program is the leveraging of JASP funding with funding from other sources and applicability of our projects to more than a single platform.  Project proposals containing restrictions on intellectual property are by nature less favorable and valuable to the government.
 
JASP issues its call for project proposals via e-mail directly to USG agencies.   JASP does not directly fund contractor efforts but provides funding to USG agencies for project management and contracting, thus the requirement for US government sponsorship.  Contractors may elect to and are encouraged to directly contact appropriate USG agencies for sponsorship at any time, in addition to any consideration due to this announcement. 

III.   SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST:

The JASP RDT&E effort is organized into three subgroups: Susceptibility Reduction, Vulnerability Reduction and Survivability Assessment (Modeling & Simulation). The JASP is interested in RDT&E initiatives that will enhance the combat survivability of both manned and unmanned aircraft.  Its principal focus is Science and Technology (S&T) for advanced technology/component development and demonstration RDT&E (6.3) as well as improving the JASPs modeling and simulation tool set.  Of particular interest are technologies with a near-term focus (less than 2 years) addressing immediate aircraft and occupant survivability concerns and requirements emerging from Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.    Other areas of interest are listed below by subgroup category:
Susceptibility Reduction

Advanced development proof-of-design concepts are sought that will offer clear, quantifiable benefits in reducing the probability of military aircraft being hit by enemy fire.  Such concepts should lead to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 5 or 6 and may range from ideas for improving operational suitability of existing susceptibility reduction systems (cost and weight reduction, increased reliability) to ideas for entirely new capabilities.  Proposals from across the spectrum of susceptibility reduction technologies are invited (e.g., IR, visual, acoustic signature reduction) but the JASP has particular interest in the following:

  Technologies or concepts that, if developed successfully, would significantly benefit operational units in the near-term by solving an immediate need or capability gap (e. g., IR decoy flares that reduce an aircrafts visual signature without impairing countermeasures effectiveness).

  Technologies that improve blue force survivability through increased Situational Awareness (SA).  Although the benefits of enhanced SA is difficult to quantify, technologies that improve SA have the potential to increase the effectiveness of existing Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), as well as improve or modify Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) (e.g., Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) for gunfire).

  Technologies or concepts that will defeat current and future generation IR threats such as MANPADs, imaging IR seekers, and infrared search and track systems.  Such technologies or concepts include low cost approaches to IR missile countermeasures and warning or entirely new concepts.

  Technologies or concepts that will counter advanced coherent, parameter-agile radar threats employed against both manned and unmanned military aircraft.  Threats could include advanced radars and passive radars.  Technologies could include electronic attack and electronic protection techniques.

Vulnerability Reduction

Emphasis should be on technologies/techniques that increase an aircrafts capability to withstand the man-made hostile aviation environment (holistic approach to threat tolerance or aircraft hardening).  A balance between technologies/techniques that are breakthrough in nature (with potentially high risk, high payoff gains within longer timeframes), and technologies/techniques that are mature enough to transition into near-term, fieldable systems is desired.  In addition to the hit tolerance and aircraft hardening aspects of vulnerability reduction, added importance should be on technologies/techniques that reduce fatalities and injuries due to crash, hard landings, and egress.  Vulnerability reduction areas of emphasis include, but are not limited to: 

  Opaque and transparent ballistic protection systems
  Fuel containment protection (leakage mitigation) for tanks and lines
  Fire suppression/extinguishing systems (passive and active)
  Crew and passenger casualty (injury and fatality) reduction
  Damage tolerant & repairable subsystems
  Advanced materials development
  Engine (jet and turboshaft) vulnerability reduction technologies and concepts
  Systems that protect the aircraft, crew, and passengers from flare and munition reactions
  MANPADS and RPG damage effects mitigation
  Optimize and maximize test data collection for modeling and simulation enhancement and validation/verification (V&V)

Survivability Assessment

Improve the capability and credibility of government-owned survivability Models and Simulations (M&S), focusing on M&S residing in the Survivability/Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC).  Other M&S providing capabilities beyond those of the SURVIAC are also of interest, and will be considered on a case by case basis.

&#61607;  CAPABILITY:
  Tools that can evaluate/predict aircraft combat crash causes, conditions and occupant effects.
  Robust signature, countermeasure and environment modeling
  Vulnerability phenomena of conventional, unconventional and asymmetric threats
  Authoritative blue system performance data (including vulnerability)
  Integration of authenticated threat models from the Intelligence Centers

&#61607;  CREDIBILITY:
  Confirm/increase credibility of SURVIAC models using open-air range data or other authoritative data 
  Better understanding of  assumptions and limitations of survivability models leading to recommendations for future investment strategies

&#61607;  USABILITY
  Projects that enhance the user interface of the JASP M&S tools to reduce probability of errors or enhance the ability to verify the code.

IV.     SUBMISSION OF PROJECT IDEAS:
This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) but rather a Request for Information (RFI) on your current survivability RDT&E and other ideas that may be of interest to the JASP.  This will be the only JASP request for survivability RDT&E ideas prior to the project proposals call to US government agencies in September 2008.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this Request for Quote (RFQ) to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<p>4. The proposal documents previous successful history of providing goods and services to health care facilities and evidence of a regional and/or national/international reputation for the services provided. (Weight: 15 points)</p>
<p>Past Performance (+4 - 0):</p>
<p>Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar work. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offeror's relative ranking will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government may contact other references than those identified by the offeror and the information received will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>a.) All Offerors shall submit a separate record of the past performance information as requested below as along with this RFQ packet. The information may be submitted prior to other parts of the proposal in order to assist the Government in commencing past performance evaluations. The offeror should include the last three (3) contracts completed during the past three years and all or at least three (3) contracts currently in process for both the offeror and for all proposed major subcontractors, which are similar in nature to this requirement.</p>
<p>1.) The Contracts listed may include those with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers, which are of similar scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for predecessor companies, corporate officers, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement. The following information should be included for each contract listed:</p>
<p>1. Name of Contracting Organization;<br />2. Contract Number;<br />3. Brief description of relevance to the services required under this RFP;<br />4. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail address (if known) and facsimile numbers of the Contracting Officer and the Project Officer for all Government contracts. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and facsimile numbers of private sector contacts equivalent of a Federal Government Contracting Officer and Project Officer (operation manager);<br />5. The dollar value of the contract;<br />6. Contract type (Firm-fixed price, cost-plus-fixed-fee, etc.);<br />7. Period of Performance;<br />8. Place of performance;</p>
<p>b.) Offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts and subcontracts. General performance information will be obtained from references.<br /><br />1.) Offerors may provide information on problems encountered and corrective actions taken on the identified contracts and subcontracts.</p>
<p>2.) References that may be contacted by the Government include the contracting officer, program manager/project officer, or the administrative officer identified above.<br /><br />3.) If no response is received from a reference, the Government will make an attempt to contact another reference identified by the offeror, to contract a reference not identified by the offeror, or to complete the evaluation with those references who responded. The Government shall consider the information provided by the references, and may also consider information obtained from other sources, when evaluating an offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>4.) Attempts to obtain responses from references will generally not go beyond two telephonic messages and/or written requests from the Government, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. The Government is not obligated to contact all of the references identified by the Offeror.</p>
<p>c.) If negative feedback is received from an offeror's reference, the Government will compare the negative response to the responses from the offeror's references to note differences. A score will be assigned appropriately to the offeror based on the information. The offeror will be given the opportunity to comment, if that information makes a difference in the Government's decision to include the offeror in or exclude the offeror from the competitive range. Any past performance deficiency or significant weakness will be discussed with offerors in the competitive range during discussions. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>d.) Offerors must send Client Authorization Letters (Attachment D) to assist in the timely processing of the past performance evaluation. Offeror's are encouraged to consolidate requests whenever possible (i.e., if the same reference has several contracts, send that reference a single notice citing all applicable contracts). Offerors may send Client Authorization Letter electronically to references with copies forwarded to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>1.) If an offeror has no relevant past performance history, an offeror must affirmatively state it possesses no relevant past performance history.</p>
<p>2.) Client Authorization Letters should be mailed or e-mailed to individual references as early as possible, but no later then three (3) working days after proposal submission. The offeror should forward a copy of the Client Authorization Letter to the contracting officer simultaneously with mailing references.</p>
<p>e.) Past performance information will be used for both responsibility determination and as an evaluation factor for award. The Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment C) will be used to collect information on an offerors past performance under existing and prior contracts/subcontract for services similar in scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement in order to evaluate offerors consistent with the past performance evaluation set forth below. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance. Evaluation of past performance information will be reflected in terms of the following degrees of performance assessment:</p>
<p>+4 Excellent: A significant majority of the sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror's performance was superior and that they would unhesitatingly do business with the offeror again. Complaints are negligible or unfounded. No doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+3 Good: Most sources of information state that the offeror's performance was good, better than average, etc., and that they would willingly do business with the offeror again. Complaints, though perhaps well-founded, are few and relatively minor. Little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+2 Neutral: Either no past performance history exists for the corporation, predecessor companies, key personnel, or major/critical subcontractors, or the offeror's record of past performance was neither predominantly favorable nor unfavorable. Sources of information are roughly divided over the quality of the offeror's performance. While some state that they would do business with the offeror again, others are doubtful or would not. Complaints are balanced by reports of good work. There is no performance record for the offeror.</p>
<p>+1 Marginal: Many sources of information made unfavorable reports about the offeror's performance and either express serious doubts about doing business with the offeror again or state that they would refuse to do so. However, there are some favorable reports, and some sources of information indicate that they would do business with the offeror again. There are many significant, serious, and well-founded complaints, but there are some reports of very good performance. Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+0 Poor: A significant majority of sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror's performance was entirely unsatisfactory and that they would not do business with the offeror again under any circumstances. Customer complaints are substantial or numerous and are well-founded. The offeror either has presented no persuasive evidence of having taken appropriate corrective action that will guard against such conduct in the foreseeable future, or it appears unlikely that the corrective action will be effective. Serious doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>f.) Any information collected concerning an offeror's past performance will be maintained in the official contract file.</p>
<p>g.) In accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>B. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>C. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

This task will be awarded to the lowest price as long as all of the line items are quoted and found to be fair and reasonable.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

PROMPT PAYMENT TERMS

The vendor will provide prompt payment discount terms in their proposal.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

	If editing is required, update the first submission; dont create a second invoice submission.

	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Dont use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. R to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a months worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:  
52.212-4(g) Invoice.

(ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
(x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.
(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds TransferCentral Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds TransferOther Than Central Contractor Registration), or applicable agency procedures.
(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.

<DESC>This BAA solicitation for Rapid HIV point-of-care Diagnostic Device for resource-limited settings (hereinafter referred to as rapid virus test) seeks to fund a consortium of scientists with a breadth of complementary skills and expertise in clinical HIV research, the associated molecular technology, diagnostics, validation testing, GMP manufacturing and project management to develop a simple to use, rapid, point-of-care (POC) HIV diagnostic devices with candidate vaccine constructs and developed vaccine-induced antibodies in the absence of true HIV-1 infections and HIVinfected infants. The diagnostic technology must demonstrate feasibility for use in resource-limited settings and in POC clinics without the use of supporting laboratory equipment such as centrifuges, vortexes or pipettes. In addition, if proposed testing requires processing of patient samples for downstream applications, the processing must be selfcontained and require limited sample manipulation and safe containment of potentially infectious material. The output should be in a visual format, without ambiguity, and include a full process negative and internal positive control. It is anticipated that 1 to 2 cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded on August 3, 2009 for a period
of up to five years for the base period and options in years 3 and 4 for additional services; studies for a similar device to make limited treatment decisions based on viral load.

<p>"This revises section L.1 of the RFP to remove the GSA-schedule-only restriction in favor of full-and-open competition for all qualified Microsoft Gold-certified vendors.</p>
<p>Vendors who *have* GSA-schedule contracts are encouraged (but not required) to submit a bid which applies their GSA contract terms and conditions and which uses GSA-published rates as a ceiling, not a floor, such that pricing is maximally competitive. The advantage of this to us is in the convenience of a shared framework of contract language and a demonstrated commitment to government contracting and (presumably therefore) experience working with government clients.</p>
<p>Otherwise, and for vendors who do *not* have GSA contracts but meet all qualifications stipulated in the RFP, there are two alternative threshhold requirements:</p>
<p>1] review and consideration of applicable federal contract language, which would be applied to be applied to any award; and</p>
<p>2] demonstrated experience implementing a MOSS solution for at least two (2) government clients in the last two (2) years."</p>
<p>&gt;Sigh.&lt; Pobody's nerfect.  Please contact me with any questions regarding this project at (202) 314-7828.</p>

<DESC>Opportunity Description:<BR><BR>A. Program Overview<BR>Innovative solutions are sought for the Coherent Superconducting Qubits Program<BR>within the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA). The<BR>Program is envisioned to begin May 1, 2009 and end by June 1, 2014. The U.S.<BR>Army Research Office (ARO) and IARPA will conduct this BAA in close<BR>partnership. This BAA solicits proposals that will lead to substantially extended coherence times in superconducting qubits.<BR><BR>Two Levels of proposals are sought, with particular interest in application to the<BR>phase qubit:<BR><BR>Level I proposals will seek to accomplish all of the following Program Goals:<BR>(1) fundamental understanding and insights into defects in superconducting<BR>qubits that currently limit coherence time and readout contrast; (2) means to<BR>characterize, measure and definitively discriminate between these separate<BR>defects; and (3) advanced materials, constructions and fabrication methods to<BR>eliminate these defects.<BR><BR>Level II proposals will seek to accomplish Level I goals as well as the<BR>following additional Program Goal: (4) demonstrate substantially extended<BR>coherence times in superconducting qubits fabricated from foregoing<BR>developments.<BR>With regard to developing fundamental understanding of superconducting<BR>qubit defects, there are several research topics of interest; including but not<BR>limited to:<BR><BR>- The origin of defects in lossy materials leading to two-level-systems that<BR>couple to qubit state transitions; defects whose population for example is reflected<BR>by the characteristic splitting density observed in readout spectroscopy of the<BR>phase qubit.<BR><BR>- The origin of 1/f noise (charge, current and flux noise) and associated<BR>electronic mechanisms affecting qubit performance as a function of temperature,<BR>but with emphasis on the operating conditions of the qubit. (e.g. for the phase<BR>qubit& 25 mK, low power, GHz &).<BR><BR>-The role of interface and surface quality attributes including:<BR><BR>-physical uniformity, smoothness and definition<BR>-chemical composition, cleanliness or contamination (stoichiometry,<BR>deleterious oxides, impurities&)<BR>-morphology (crystallinity, crystal orientation, grain size &)<BR>-stability of all of the above (e.g. a junction is considered unstable from<BR>which oxygen diffuses into adjacent layers, resulting in an evolution of<BR>stoichiometry and potentially crystallinity and thus electronic properties(e.g.<BR>dielectric loss tangent))<BR><BR>- The effects of coherence length mismatch between dissimilar top and bottom<BR>electrodes<BR><BR>- Novel measurement techniques for isolating decoherence mechanisms and<BR>quantifying their relative contribution.<BR><BR>- Defects that may be intrinsic to specific device architectures such as junction<BR>type (SIS, SNS, ScS (constriction or microbridge junctions) or SvS (vacuum<BR>junctions)), junction geometry, qubit geometry and layout.<BR><BR>- The correlation between alternative materials metrics and qubit performance<BR><BR>- The role overall qubit size and junction bias current plays, in combination<BR>with defects, in enhancing or reducing energy decay and phase coherence in<BR>different forms of qubits. For example, ultra small flux and transmon qubits (with<BR>ultra-small junctions) have demonstrated better coherence performance (T1 and<BR>T2) than larger flux and current-biased phase qubits (with larger junctions).<BR><BR>- The role defects in junctions plays in contributing to energy loss when<BR>incorporated into different configurations of resonant circuits from coplanar<BR>waveguides to lumped-element resonators, challenging the notion of<BR>dissipationless Josephson junctions.<BR><BR>- New concepts in decoherence mechanisms<BR><BR>Any combination of the above and or additional topics may be included in a<BR>proposal. In general, for all topics pursued in developing fundamental<BR>understanding of superconducting qubit defects, proposals should focus on:<BR><BR>a) developing a full understanding of the defect types, the mechanisms by<BR>which they occur, the mechanisms by which they affect the qubit, and the<BR>qubit performance characteristics they limit (coherence time, contrast, etc.),<BR><BR>b) the means for definitive characterization and measurement of those defects<BR>in the presence of other defects, and subsequently<BR><BR>c) the most effective means for their elimination.<BR><BR>Note: proposals should also describe test platforms to be used in initial studies of<BR>decoherence mechanisms, materials screening and process development. Test<BR>platforms such as, but not limited to resonators and antennas should be proposed<BR>in appropriate detail, including physically descriptive drawings or photographs<BR>and electrical schematics. Details should be given on how the test platform will<BR>measure the desired materials properties and how, if possible, the platform can be<BR>used to equivalently reveal qubit performance metrics. The correlation between<BR>selected materials metrics and qubit performance should be unambiguously<BR>supported by a description of theoretical as well as experimental evidence.<BR>With regard to advanced materials and fabrication methods, there are several<BR>research topics of interest; including but not limited to:<BR>- Tunnel junctions of high physical, chemical, morphological, etc& quality and<BR>stability, as well as high critical current and critical current uniformity<BR>- Ultra low-loss dielectrics for insulators and junctions and characterization of<BR>detrimental effects of impurities and imperfections therein as a result of the<BR>fabrication process<BR>- Advanced electrode materials and or passivation layers to minimize 1/f noise<BR>from interfaces, electrode surfaces and wiring<BR>- Control of contamination from magnetic materials, such as iron<BR>- High purity materials for sputtering targets<BR>- Innovative qubit designs that may for example a) minimize or eliminate<BR>materials contributing to decoherence (e.g. through vacuum insulators, etc&), or<BR>b) circumvent deleterious mechanisms intrinsic to conventional geometries (e.g.<BR>through alternative geometries and or vacuum or normal metal or constriction<BR>barriers)<BR>- Fabrication techniques providing superior materials and reproducibility<BR>- Fabrication quality of electrodes, including the effects of rough edges<BR>- Chamber(s) characterization (e.g., temperature, gases, other materials in the<BR>chamber) for depositing films and oxidation for fabricating reproducible high<BR>quality qubits<BR>- New concepts in materials and fabrication techniques or qubit designs<BR>Any combination of the above and or additional topics may be included in a given<BR>proposal. In general, for all topics pursued in advanced materials and fabrication<BR>methods, proposals should focus on developing materials advances, fabrication<BR>techniques, and junction or qubit designs that will substantially eliminate<BR>decoherence mechanisms and significantly improve qubit performance.<BR>

   (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
 
   (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
 
   (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
 
   (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
 
     (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
 
     (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--
 
         (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
 
         (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
 
         (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
 
       (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
 
     (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
 
     (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
 
     (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
 
   (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
 
   (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

52.222-15  CERTIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY  (FEB 1988)
 
   (a)  By entering into this contract, the Contractor certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has an interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded government contracts by virtue of section 3(a) of the Davis-Bacon Act or 29 CFR 5.12(a)(1).

   (a) Definitions.
 
   "Covered area," as used in this clause, means the geographical area described in the solicitation for this contract.
 
   "Deputy Assistant Secretary," as used in this clause, means the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance, U.S. Department of Labor, or a designee.
 
   "Employer identification number," as used in this clause, means the Federal Social Security number used on the employer's quarterly federal tax return, U.S. Treasury Department Form 941.
 
   "Minority," as used in this clause, means--
 
     (1) American Indian or Alaskan Native (all persons having origins in any of the original peoples of North America and maintaining identifiable tribal affiliations through membership and participation or community identification).
 
     (2) Asian and Pacific Islander (all persons having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands);
 
     (3) Black (all persons having origins in any of the black African racial groups not of Hispanic origin); and
 
     (4) Hispanic (all persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race).
 
   (b) If the Contractor, or a subcontractor at any tier, subcontracts a portion of the work involving any construction trade, each such subcontract in excess of $10,000 shall include this clause and the Notice containing the goals for minority and female participation stated in the solicitation for this contract.
 
   (c) If the Contractor is participating in a Hometown Plan (41 CFR 60-4) approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in a covered area, either individually or through an association, its affirmative action obligations on all work in the plan area (including goals) shall comply with the plan for those trades that have unions participating in the plan.  Contractors must be able to demonstrate participation in, and compliance with, the provisions of the plan. Each Contractor or subcontractor participating in an approved plan is also required to comply with its obligations under the Equal Opportunity clause, and to make a good faith effort to achieve each goal under the plan in each trade in which it has employees.  The overall good-faith performance by other Contractors or subcontractors toward a goal in an approved plan does not excuse any Contractor's or subcontractor's failure to make good-faith efforts to achieve the plan's goals.
 
   (d) The Contractor shall implement the affirmative action procedures in subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause.  The goals stated in the solicitation for this contract are expressed as percentages of the total hours of employment and training of minority and female utilization that the Contractor should reasonably be able to achieve in each construction trade in which it has employees in the covered area.  If the Contractor performs construction work in a geographical area located outside of the covered area, it shall apply the goals established for the geographical area where that work is actually performed.  The Contractor is expected to make substantially uniform progress toward its goals in each craft.
 
   (e) Neither the terms and conditions of any collective bargaining agreement, nor the failure by a union with which the Contractor has a collective bargaining agreement, to refer minorities or women shall excuse the Contractor's obligations under this clause, Executive Order 11246, as amended, or the regulations thereunder.
 
   (f) In order for the nonworking training hours of apprentices and trainees to be counted in meeting the goals, apprentices and trainees must be employed by the Contractor during the training period, and the Contractor must have a commitment to employ the apprentices and trainees at the completion of their training, subject to the availability of employment opportunities.  Trainees must be trained pursuant to training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor.
 
   (g) The Contractor shall take affirmative action to ensure equal employment opportunity.  The evaluation of the Contractor's compliance with this clause shall be based upon its effort to achieve maximum results from its actions.  The Contractor shall document these efforts fully and implement affirmative action steps at least as extensive as the following:
 
     (1) Ensure a working environment free of harassment, intimidation, and coercion at all sites and in all facilities where the Contractor's employees are assigned to work.  The Contractor, if possible, will assign two or more women to each construction project. The Contractor shall ensure that foremen, superintendents, and other onsite supervisory personnel are aware of and carry out the Contractor's obligation to maintain such a working environment, with specific attention to minority or female individuals working at these sites or facilities.
 
     (2) Establish and maintain a current list of sources for minority and female recruitment.  Provide written notification to minority and female recruitment sources and community organizations when the Contractor or its unions have employment opportunities available, and maintain a record of the organizations' responses.
 
     (3) Establish and maintain a current file of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of each minority and female off-the-street applicant, referrals of minorities or females from unions, recruitment sources, or community organizations, and the action taken with respect to each individual.  If an individual was sent to the union hiring hall for referral and not referred back to the Contractor by the union or, if referred back, not employed by the Contractor, this shall be documented in the file, along with whatever additional actions the Contractor may have taken.
 
     (4) Immediately notify the Deputy Assistant Secretary when the union or unions with which the Contractor has a collective bargaining agreement has not referred back to the Contractor a minority or woman sent by the Contractor, or when the Contractor has other information that the union referral process has impeded the Contractor's efforts to meet its obligations.
 
     (5) Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in training programs for the area that expressly include minorities and women, including upgrading programs and apprenticeship and trainee programs relevant to the Contractor's employment needs, especially those programs funded or approved by the Department of Labor.  The Contractor shall provide notice of these programs to the sources compiled under subparagraph (g)(2) of this clause.
 
     (6) Disseminate the Contractor's equal employment policy by--
 
       (i) Providing notice of the policy to unions and to training, recruitment, and outreach programs, and requesting their cooperation in assisting the Contractor in meeting its contract obligations;
 
       (ii) Including the policy in any policy manual and in collective bargaining agreements;
 
       (iii) Publicizing the policy in the company newspaper, annual report, etc.;
 
       (iv) Reviewing the policy with all management personnel and with all minority and female employees at least once a year; and
 
       (v) Posting the policy on bulletin boards accessible to employees at each location where construction work is performed.
 
    (7) Review, at least annually, the Contractor's equal employment policy and affirmative action obligations with all employees having responsibility for hiring, assignment, layoff, termination, or other employment decisions.  Conduct review of this policy with all on-site supervisory personnel before initiating construction work at a job site.  A written record shall be made and maintained identifying the time and place of these meetings, persons attending, subject matter discussed, and disposition of the subject matter.
 
     (8) Disseminate the Contractor's equal employment policy externally by including it in any advertising in the news media, specifically including minority and female news media.  Provide written notification to, and discuss this policy with, other Contractors and subcontractors with which the Contractor does or anticipates doing business.
 
     (9) Direct recruitment efforts, both oral and written, to minority, female, and community organizations, to schools with minority and female students, and to minority and female recruitment and training organizations serving the Contractor's recruitment area and employment needs.  Not later than 1 month before the date for acceptance of applications for apprenticeship or training by any recruitment source, send written notification to organizations such as the above, describing the openings, screening procedures, and tests to be used in the selection process.
 
     (10) Encourage present minority and female employees to recruit minority persons and women.  Where reasonable, provide after-school, summer, and vacation employment to minority and female youth both on the site and in other areas of the Contractor's workforce.
 
     (11) Validate all tests and other selection requirements where required under 41 CFR 60-3.
 
     (12) Conduct, at least annually, an inventory and evaluation at least of all minority and female personnel for promotional opportunities.  Encourage these employees to seek or to prepare for, through appropriate training, etc., opportunities for promotion.
 
     (13) Ensure that seniority practices job classifications, work assignments, and other personnel practices, do not have a discriminatory effect by continually monitoring all personnel and employment-related activities to ensure that the Contractor's obligations under this contract are being carried out.
 
     (14) Ensure that all facilities and company activities are nonsegregated except that separate or single-user rest rooms and necessary dressing or sleeping areas shall be provided to assure privacy between the sexes.
 
     (15) Maintain a record of solicitations for subcontracts for minority and female construction contractors and suppliers, including circulation of solicitations to minority and female contractor associations and other business associations.
 
     (16) Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisors' adherence to and performance under the Contractor's equal employment policy and affirmative action obligations.
 
   (h) The Contractor is encouraged to participate in voluntary associations that may assist in fulfilling one or more of the affirmative action obligations contained in subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause.  The efforts of a contractor association, joint contractor-union, contractor-community, or similar group of which the contractor is a member and participant may be asserted as fulfilling one or more of its obligations under subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause, provided the Contractor--
 
     (1) Actively participates in the group;
 
     (2) Makes every effort to ensure that the group has a positive impact on the employment of minorities and women in the industry;
 
     (3) Ensures that concrete benefits of the program are reflected in the Contractor's minority and female workforce participation;
 
     (4) Makes a good-faith effort to meet its individual goals and timetables; and
 
     (5) Can provide access to documentation that demonstrates the effectiveness of actions taken on behalf of the Contractor.  The obligation to comply is the Contractor's, and failure of such a group to fulfill an obligation shall not be a defense for the Contractor's noncompliance.
 
   (i) A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women shall be established.  The Contractor is required to provide equal employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all minority groups, both male and female, and all women, both minority and nonminority.  Consequently, the Contractor may be in violation of Executive Order 11246, as amended, if a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner.
 
   (j) The Contractor shall not use goals or affirmative action standards to discriminate against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
 
   (k) The Contractor shall not enter into any subcontract with any person or firm debarred from Government contracts under Executive Order 11246, as amended.
 
   (l) The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for violation of this clause and of the Equal Opportunity clause, including suspension, termination, and cancellation of existing subcontracts, as may be imposed or ordered under Executive Order 11246, as amended, and its implementing regulations, by the OFCCP. Any failure to carry out these sanctions and penalties as ordered shall be a violation of this clause and Executive Order 11246, as amended.
 
   (m) The Contractor in fulfilling its obligations under this clause shall implement affirmative action procedures at least as extensive as those prescribed in paragraph (g) of this clause, so as to achieve maximum results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity. If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended, the implementing regulations, or this clause, the Deputy Assistant Secretary shall take action as prescribed in 41 CFR 60-4.8.
 
   (n) The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to--
 
     (1) Monitor all employment-related activity to ensure that the Contractor's equal employment policy is being carried out;
 
     (2) Submit reports as may be required by the Government; and
 
     (3) Keep records that shall at least include for each employee the name, address, telephone number, construction trade, union affiliation (if any), employee identification number, social security number, race, sex, status (e.g., mechanic, apprentice, trainee, helper, or laborer), dates of changes in status, hours worked per week in the indicated trade, rate of pay, and locations at which the work was performed. Records shall be maintained in an easily understandable and retrievable form; however, to the degree that existing records satisfy this requirement, separate records are not required to be maintained.
 
   (o) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as a limitation upon the application of other laws that establish different standards of compliance or upon the requirements for the hiring of local or other area residents (e.g., those under the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 and the Community Development Block Grant Program).
 
 
 
52.228-5  INSURANCE - WORK ON A GOVERNMENT INSTALLATION (JAN 1997)
 
   (a) The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the entire performance of this contract, at least the kinds and minimum amounts of insurance required in the Schedule or elsewhere in the contract.
 
   (b) Before commencing work under this contract, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing that the required insurance has been obtained. The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective--
 
     (1) For such period as the laws of the State in which this contract is to be performed prescribe; or
 
     (2) Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever period is longer.
 
   (c) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in subcontracts under this contract that require work on a Government installation and shall require subcontractors to provide and maintain the insurance required in the Schedule or elsewhere in the contract. The Contractor shall maintain a copy of all subcontractors' proofs of required insurance, and shall make copies available to the Contracting Officer upon request.

     (1) The Contractor's request for progress payments shall include the following substantiation:
 
       (i) An itemization of the amounts requested, related to the various elements of work required by the contract covered by the payment requested.

       (v) Additional supporting data in a form and detail required by the Contracting Officer.
 
     (2) In the preparation of estimates, the Contracting Officer may authorize material delivered on the site and preparatory work done to be taken into consideration. Material delivered to the Contractor at locations other than the site also may be taken into consideration if--
 
       (i) Consideration is specifically authorized by this contract; and (ii) The Contractor furnishes satisfactory evidence that it has acquired title to such material and that the material will be used to perform this contract.
 
   (c) Contractor certification. Along with each request for progress payments, the Contractor shall furnish the following certification, or payment shall not be made: (However, if the Contractor elects to delete paragraph (c)(4) from the certification, the certification is still acceptable.)

 (Title)
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 
 (Date)
 
   (d) Refund of unearned amounts.  If the Contractor, after making a certified request for progress payments, discovers that a portion or all of such request constitutes a payment for performance by the Contractor that fails to conform to the specifications, terms, and conditions of this contract (hereinafter referred to as the "unearned amount"), the Contractor shall --
 
     (1) Notify the Contracting Officer of such performance deficiency; and
 
     (2) Be obligated to pay the Government an amount (computed by the Contracting Officer in the manner provided in paragraph (j) of this clause) equal to interest on the unearned amount from the 8th day after the date of receipt of the unearned amount until--
 
       (i) The date the Contractor notifies the Contracting Officer that the performance deficiency has been corrected; or
 
       (ii) The date the Contractor reduces the amount of any subsequent certified request for progress payments by an amount equal to the unearned amount.
 
   (e) Retainage.  If the Contracting Officer finds that satisfactory progress was achieved during any period for which a progress payment is to be made, the Contracting Officer shall authorize payment to be made in full.  However, if satisfactory progress has not been made, the Contracting Officer may retain a maximum of 10 percent of the amount of the payment until satisfactory progress is achieved.  When the work is substantially complete, the Contracting Officer may retain from previously withheld funds and future progress payments that amount the Contracting Officer considers adequate for protection of the Government and shall release to the Contractor all the remaining withheld funds.  Also, on completion and acceptance of each separate building, public work, or other division of the contract, for which the price is stated separately in the contract, payment shall be made for the completed work without retention of a percentage.
 
   (f) Title, liability, and reservation of rights.  All material and work covered by progress payments made shall, at the time of payment, become the sole property of the Government, but this shall not be construed as--
 
     (1) Relieving the Contractor from the sole responsibility for all material and work upon which payments have been made or the restoration of any damaged work; or
 
     (2) Waiving the right of the Government to require the fulfillment of all of the terms of the contract.
 
   (g) Reimbursement for bond premiums.  In making these progress payments, the Government shall, upon request, reimburse the Contractor for the amount of premiums paid for performance and payment bonds (including coinsurance and reinsurance agreements, when applicable) after the Contractor has furnished evidence of full payment to the surety.  The retainage provisions in paragraph (e) of this clause shall not apply to that portion of progress payments attributable to bond premiums.
 
   (h) Final Payment.  The Government shall pay the amount due the Contractor under this contract after--
 
     (1) Completion and acceptance of all work;
 
     (2) Presentation of a properly executed voucher; and
 
     (3) Presentation of release of all claims against the Government arising by virtue of this contract, other than claims, in stated amounts, that the Contractor has specifically excepted from the operation of the release.  A release may also be required of the assignee if the Contractor's claim to amounts payable under this contract has been assigned under the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940 (31 U.S.C. 3727 and 41 U.S.C. 15).
 
   (i) Limitation because of undefinitized work.  Notwithstanding any provision of this contract, progress payments shall not exceed 80 percent on work accomplished on undefinitized contract actions. A "contract action" is any action resulting in a contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, including contract modifications for additional supplies or services, but not including contract modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of the contract, such as contract modifications issued pursuant to the Changes clause, or funding and other administrative changes.

   The Contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses and permits, and for complying with any Federal, State, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations applicable to the performance of the work.

The Contractor shall also be responsible for all materials delivered and work performed until completion and acceptance of the entire work, except for any completed unit of work which may have been accepted under the contract.
 
 
 
52.232-19  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR  (APR 1984)
 
   Funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond September 30, 2008.  The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond September 30, 2008, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
 
 
 
52.236-9  PROTECTION OF EXISTING VEGETATION, STRUCTURES, EQUIPMENT, UTILITIES, AND IMPROVEMENTS  (APR 1984)
 
   (a) The Contractor shall preserve and protect all structures, equipment, and vegetation (such as trees, shrubs, and grass) on or adjacent to the work site, which are not to be removed and which do not unreasonably interfere with the work required under this contract.  The Contractor shall only remove trees when specifically authorized to do so, and shall avoid damaging vegetation that will remain in place.  If any limbs or branches of trees are broken during contract performance, or by the careless operation of equipment, or by workmen, the Contractor shall trim those limbs or branches with a clean cut and paint the cut with a tree-pruning compound as directed by the Contracting Officer.
 
   (b) The Contractor shall protect from damage all existing improvements and utilities (1) at or near the work site and (2) on adjacent property of a third party, the locations of which are made known to or should be known by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall repair any damage to those facilities, including those that are the property of a third party, resulting from failure to comply with the requirements of this contract or failure to exercise reasonable care in performing the work.  If the Contractor fails or refuses to repair the damage promptly, the Contracting Officer may have the necessary work performed and charge the cost to the Contractor.
 
 
 
 
52.236-11  USE AND POSSESSION PRIOR TO COMPLETION  (APR 1984)
 
   (a) The Government shall have the right to take possession of or use any completed or partially completed part of the work.  Before taking possession of or using any work, the Contracting Officer shall furnish the Contractor a list of items of work remaining to be performed or corrected on those portions of the work that the Government intends to take possession of or use.  However, failure of the Contracting Officer to list any item of work shall not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for complying with the terms of the contract.  The Government's possession or use shall not be deemed an acceptance of any work under the contract.
 
   (b) While the Government has such possession or use, the Contractor shall be relieved of the responsibility for the loss of or damage to the work resulting from the Government's possession or use, notwithstanding the terms of the clause in this contract entitled "Permits and Responsibilities." If prior possession or use by the Government delays the progress of the work or causes additional expense to the Contractor, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the contract price or the time of completion, and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.
 
 
52.236-12  CLEANING UP  (APR 1984)
 
   The Contractor shall at all times keep the work area, including storage areas, free from accumulations of waste materials.  Before completing the work, the Contractor shall remove from the work and premises any rubbish, tools, scaffolding, equipment, and materials that are not the property of the Government.

   (b)  For these purposes on contracts for construction or dismantling, demolition, or removal of improvements, the  Contractor shall--
 
     (1)  Provide appropriate safety barricades, signs, and  signal lights;
 
     (2)  Comply with the standards issued by the Secretary of  Labor at 29 CFR Part 1926 and 29 CFR Part 1910; and
 
     (3)  Ensure that any additional measures the Contracting  Officer determines to be reasonably necessary for the purposes are  taken.
 
   (c)  If this contract is for construction or dismantling, demolition or removal of improvements with any Department of  Defense agency or component, the Contractor shall comply with all  pertinent provisions of the latest version of U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual, EM 385-1-1, in  effect on the date of the solicitation.
 
   (d)  Whenever the Contracting Officer becomes aware of any noncompliance with these requirements or any condition which poses  a serious or imminent danger to the health or safety of the public  or Government personnel, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor orally, with written confirmation, and request  immediate initiation of corrective action.  This notice, when  delivered to the Contractor or the Contractor's representative at  the work site, shall be deemed sufficient notice of the  noncompliance and that corrective action is required.  After  receiving the notice, the Contractor shall immediately take  corrective action.  If the Contractor fails or refuses to promptly  take corrective action, the Contracting Officer may issue an order  stopping all or part of the work until satisfactory corrective  action has been taken.  The Contractor shall not be entitled to  any equitable adjustment of the contract price or extension of the  performance schedule on any stop work order issued under this  clause.
 
   (e)  The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (e), with appropriate changes in the designation of the parties, in subcontracts.
 
 
 
52.236-19  ORGANIZATION AND DIRECTION OF THE WORK (APR 1984)
 
    (a)  When this contract is executed, the Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a chart showing the general executive and administrative organization, the personnel to be employed in connection with the work under this contract, and their respective duties.  The Contractor shall keep the data furnished current by supplementing it as additional information becomes available.
 
    (b)  Work performance under this contract shall be under the full-time resident direction of:  (1) the Contractor, if the Contractor is an individual; (2) one or more principal partners, if the Contractor is a partnership; or (3) one or more senior officers, if Contractor is a corporation, association, or similar legal entity. However, if the Contracting Officer approves, the Contracting may be represented in the direction of the work by a specific person or persons holding positions other than those identified in this paragraph.
 
 
 
52.242-14  SUSPENSION OF WORK  (APR 1984)
 
   (a) The Contracting Officer may order the Contractor, in writing, to suspend, delay, or interrupt all or any part of the work of this contract for the period of time that the Contracting Officer determines appropriate for the convenience of the Government.
 
   (b) If the performance of all or any part of the work is, for an unreasonable period of time, suspended, delayed, or interrupted (1) by an act of the Contracting Officer in the administration of this contract, or (2) by the Contracting Officer's failure to act within the time specified in this contract (or within a reasonable time if not specified), an adjustment shall be made for any increase in the cost of performance of this contract (excluding profit) necessarily caused by the unreasonable suspension, delay, or interruption, and the contract modified in writing accordingly.  However, no adjustment shall be made under this clause for any suspension, delay, or interruption to the extent that performance would have been so suspended, delayed, or interrupted by any other cause, including the fault or negligence of the Contractor, or for which an equitable adjustment is provided for or excluded under any other term or condition of this contract.
 
   (c) A claim under this clause shall not be allowed (1) for any costs incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor shall have notified the Contracting Officer in writing of the act or failure to act involved (but this requirement shall not apply as to a claim resulting from a suspension order), and (2) unless the claim, in an amount stated, is asserted in writing as soon as practicable after the termination of the suspension, delay, or interruption, but not later than the date of final payment under the contract.
 
 
 
52.242-15  STOP-WORK ORDER  (AUG 1989)
 
   (a)  The Contracting Officer may, at any time, by written order to the Contractor, require the Contractor to stop all, or any part, of the work called for by this contract for a period of 90 days after the order is delivered to the Contractor, and for any further period to which the parties may agree.  The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued under this clause.  Upon receipt of the order, the Contractor shall immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize the incurrence of costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period of work stoppage.  Within a period of 90 days after a stop-work order is delivered to the Contractor, or within any extension of that period to which the parties shall have agreed, the Contracting Officer shall either -
 
     (1)  Cancel the stop-work order; or
 
     (2)  Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the Government, clause of this contract.
 
   (b)  If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled or the period of the order or any extension thereof expires, the Contractor shall resume work.  The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if-
 
     (1)  The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and
 
     (2)  The Contractor asserts its right to the adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that, if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted at any time before final payment under this contract.
 
   (c)  If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement.
 
   (d)  If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order.
 
 
 
52.246-12  INSPECTION OF CONSTRUCTION (AUG 1996)
 
   (a)  Definition.  "Work" includes, but is not limited to, materials, workmanship, and manufacture and fabrication of components.
 
   (b)  The Contractor shall maintain an adequate inspection system and perform such inspections as will ensure that the work performed under the contract conforms to contract requirements.  The Contractor shall maintain complete inspection records and make them available to the Government.  All work shall be conducted under the general direction of the Contracting Officer and is subject to Government inspection and test at all places and at all reasonable times before acceptance to ensure strict compliance with the terms of the contract.
 
   (c)  Government inspections and tests are for the sole benefit of the Government and do not -
 
     (1)  Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for providing adequate quality control measures;
 
     (2)  Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for damage to or loss of the material before acceptance;
 
     (3)  Constitute or imply acceptance; or
 
     (4)  Affect the continuing rights of the Government after acceptance of the completed work under paragraph (i) below.
 
   (d)  The presence or absence of a Government inspector does not relieve the Contractor from any contract requirement, nor is the inspector authorized to change any term or condition of the specification without the Contracting Officer's written authorization.
 
   (e)  The Contractor shall promptly furnish, at no increase in contract price, all facilities, labor, and material reasonably needed for performing such safe and convenient inspections and tests as may be required by the Contracting Officer.  The Government may charge to the Contractor any additional cost of inspection or test when work is not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, or when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.  The Government shall perform all inspections and tests in a manner that will not unnecessarily delay the work.  Special, full size, and performance tests shall be performed as described in the contract.
 
   (f)  The Contractor shall, without charge, replace or correct work found by the Government not to conform to contract requirements, unless in the public interest the Government consents to accept the work with an appropriate adjustment in contract price.  The Contractor shall promptly segregate and remove rejected material from the premises.
 
   (g)  If the Contractor does not promptly replace or correct rejected work, the Government may (1)  by contract or otherwise, replace or correct the work and charge the cost to the Contractor or (2)  terminate for default the Contractor's right to proceed.
 
   (h)  If, before acceptance of the entire work, the Government decides to examine already completed work by removing it or tearing it out, the Contractor, on request, shall promptly furnish all necessary facilities, labor, and material.  If the work is found to be defective or nonconforming in any material respect due to the fault of the Contractor or its subcontractors, the Contractor shall defray the expenses of the examination and of satisfactory reconstruction.  However, if the work is found to meet contract requirements, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment for the additional services involved in the examination and reconstruction, including, if completion of the work was thereby delayed, an extension of time.
 
   (i)  Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government shall accept, as promptly as practicable after completion and inspection, all work required by the contract or that portion of the work the Contracting Officer determines can be accepted separately.  Acceptance shall be final and conclusive except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or the Government's rights under any warranty or guarantee.

However, the Contractor's liability for the transportation charges shall not exceed an amount equal to the cost of transportation by the usual commercial method of shipment between the place of delivery specified in this contract and the Contractor's plant, and return.
 
     (3) Any supplies or parts thereof, corrected or furnished in replacement under this clause, shall also be subject to the terms of this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered.  The warranty, with respect to supplies or parts thereof, shall be equal in duration to that in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies.

       (ii) Retain such supplies and reduce the contract price by an amount equitable under the circumstances.

         (A) May, for sampling purposes, group any supplies delivered under this contract;
 
         (B) Shall require the size of the sample to be that required by sampling procedures specified in the contract for the quantity of supplies on which warranty action is proposed;
 
         (C) May project warranty sampling results over supplies in the same shipment or other supplies contained in other shipments even though all of such supplies are not present at the point of reinspection; provided, that the supplies remaining are reasonably representative of the quantity on which warranty action is proposed; and
 
         (D) Need not use the same lot size as on original inspection or reconstitute the original inspection lots.
 
       (ii) Within a reasonable time after notice of any breach of the warranties specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may exercise one or more of the following options:
 
         (A) Require an equitable adjustment in the contract price for any group of supplies.

     (4) (i) The Contracting Officer may, by contract or otherwise, correct or replace the nonconforming supplies with similar supplies from another source and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the Government thereby if the Contractor--
 
         (A) Fails to make redelivery of the corrected or replaced supplies within the time established for their return; or
 
         (B) Fails either to accept return of the nonconforming supplies or fails to make progress after their return to correct or replace them so as to endanger performance of the delivery schedule, and in either of these circumstances does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure.
 
       (ii) Instead of correction or replacement by the Government, the Contracting Officer may require an equitable adjustment of the contract price.  In addition, if the Contractor fails to furnish timely disposition instructions, the Contracting Officer may dispose of the nonconforming supplies for the Contractor's account in a reasonable manner.  The Government is entitled to reimbursement from the Contractor, or from the proceeds of such disposal, for the reasonable expenses of the care and disposition of the nonconforming supplies, as well as for excess costs incurred or to be incurred.
 
     (5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of this contract.
 
 
 
52.249-10  DEFAULT (FIXED-PRICE CONSTRUCTION)  (APR 1984)
 
   (a) If the Contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the work or any separable part, with the diligence that will insure its completion within the time specified in this contract including any extension, or fails to complete the work within this time, the Government may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right to proceed with the work (or the separable part of the work) that has been delayed. In this event, the Government may take over the work and complete it by contract or otherwise, and may take possession of and use any materials, appliances, and plant on the work site necessary for completing the work. The Contractor and its sureties shall be liable for any damage to the Government resulting from the Contractor's refusal or failure to complete the work within the specified time, whether or not the Contractor's right to proceed with the work is terminated. This liability includes any increased costs incurred by the Government in completing the work.
 
   (b) The Contractor's right to proceed shall not be terminated nor the Contractor charged with damages under this clause, if--
 
     (1) The delay in completing the work arises from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.  Examples of such causes include--

       (x) Unusually severe weather, or
 
       (xi) Delays of subcontractors or suppliers at any tier arising from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of both the Contractor and the subcontractors or suppliers; and
 
     (2) The Contractor, within 10 days from the beginning of any delay (unless extended by the Contracting Officer), notifies the Contracting Officer in writing of the causes of delay. The Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts and the extent of delay. If, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, the findings of fact warrant such action, the time for completing the work shall be extended. The findings of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive on the parties, but subject to appeal under the Disputes clause.
 
   (c) If, after termination of the Contractor's right to proceed, it is determined that the Contractor was not in default, or that the delay was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties will be the same as if the termination had been issued for the convenience of the Government.
 
   (d) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.

Unfortunately, I will not have this documentation by Friday to submit with our bid package.  

(a)  Question:  With this in mind, can I submit a proposal in response to Solicitation HSFEHQ-08-R-0021 as a certified Kansas Company with the intention of being compliant with the state of Kansas before the potential award date?  
Answer:    Your company must reside in or primarily do business in Kansas.  FAR 52.226-3 contains the test for "residing in" or "primarily doing business in" a particular location.  
 
6.  Question:  In reviewing the Past Performance Questionnaires posted on FBO this morning, it appears that these phone interviews are to be conducted by a Government Employee after the bid is submitted, is this correct?  Answer:  Please provide all points of contact for each evaluation you submit.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to an additional question received in response to the original synopsis solicitation.  There is no change to the original response due date.<BR><BR>The following question and answer is provided:<BR><BR>Question 3:  The solicitation referenced above calls out for two cameras, a SWIR version and a MWIR version.  The SWIR version must have a system spectral response from at least 1 micrometer to at least 2.5 micrometers.  The MWIR version must have a system spectral response from at least 2 micrometers to at least 5 micrometers.  My question is this, does the end user require the cameras to be delivered with cold filters optimized for these spectral ranges?   Or can the FPAs used in each camera cover the entire range (1-5 microns) and the end user will supply the necessary cold filters required to achieve the spectral range of interest after delivery and acceptance?  Answer 3:  The government does not require that the cameras be delivered with cold filters optimized for the 2 spectral ranges. It is perfectly acceptable for the FPA used in each camera to cover the entire spectral range of 1-5 microns.<BR>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOT A SOLICITATION
<p>RFI REFERENCE NUMBER - AFRL07300801</p>
<p>The government is requesting information from companies working on High-Frequency, sky-wave, Over the Horizon Radar (OTHR) Technology. The Government is interested in receiving information from systems vendors as well as key component vendors whose technology is useful in the development of a Next Generation Over-the-Horizon Radar (NGOTHR). The Government wishes to assess the potential for Over-the-Horizon Radar contributions to fill wide area surveillance gaps in North American defense and security.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Persistent, wide-area air and maritime surveillance of the approaches to North America has been a long-standing requirement for North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) defense missions, and also supports Department of Homeland Security missions. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council validated the homeland defense surveillance gaps identified in the NORAD Homeland Air and Cruise Missile Defense Joint Capability Document in November 2005. The USAF Integrated Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment and the Air and Missile Defense Advisory Panel have each cited the potential of exploiting recent advances that could make NGOTHR an essential component of an effective and affordable family of systems to meet the persistent, wide-area surveillance needs. A family of systems approach to addressing wide area surveillance gaps is expected and NGOTHR is a key wide area surveillance cueing system in that approach.</p>
<p>Current generation OTHR needs additional sensitivity and improved suppression of noise and clutter to process the full range of missions in today's threat environment. Expanded 24/7/365 capabilities are also desired to meet operational requirements. Research over the last 20 years indicates that a NGOTHR has potential to mitigate noise and spread-Doppler clutter sensitivity problems by exploiting two-dimensional transmit and receive configurations, advanced digital components, and advanced signal processing techniques.</p>
<p>Prior to embarking on a large scale NGOTHR development in the US, a combination of tests and analysis are planned to support recommendations on the architecture for a NGOTHR system. A Technology Risk Reduction Initiative (TRRI) will bring together the U.S. OTHR community to define risks, develop concepts, and mature technologies. Successful completion of the TRRI will lead to the implementation of an NGOTHR Joint Concept Technology Demonstration (JCTD) or other acquisition-related activity. Key activities and objectives for the TRRI are</p>
<p>1. To develop a roadmap for a robust multi-mission NGOTHR capability for the U.S.</p>
<p>2. Validate performance of key radar hardware and software components expected in a NGOTHR capability.</p>
<p>3. Provide a high-fidelity OTHR modeling and simulation capability</p>
<p>4. Conduct tests, data collections, and analyses to evaluate performance of two-dimensional transmit and receive array configurations, key radar hardware and software components, waveforms and adaptive beam-forming, and other promising signal processing techniques.</p>
<p>5. Collect pertinent cost data for preparing rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates for planning , affordability, and life cycle cost assessments</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NORAD/USNORTHCOM Integrated Priority List (IPL) specified the operational requirements for wide area surveillance. The TRRI team is initiating a roadmap for maturing NGOTHR and for determining the performance capabilities of the new technology against the gaps. The TRRI is planned for FY08 and FY09.</p>
<p>As the government team develops a roadmap for a robust multi-mission NGOTHR capability for the U.S., we are interested in inputs from industry. We are performing a market survey of NGOTHR technology, both system level as well as critical technology elements. This RFI will be used by the TRRI team in the development of the NGOTHR roadmap.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support NGOTHR roadmap development, to assess OTHR architecture tradeoffs, to identify technology risks and maturation strategies, to estimate the level of investment required over the next 5 years, and to determine industries interest in participating in the development of a NGOTHR capability. The potential developers should understand that firm requirements for a NGOTHR system have not been defined at this time. Requirements will evolve and are tied to user needs, technology maturation, concept of operation, and cost as an independent variable. <br /><br />The TRRI team will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to understand the current state of the art in OTHR technology.</p>
<p>The Government is interested in receiving information from companies working on OTHR system technology and from component vendors whose subsystems and critical components are useful in the development of the OTHR system. The Government will accept partial responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>We solicit the interest of vendors, organizations and/or consortia with OTHR expertise in one or more of the following areas:</p>
<p>1. System architectures<br />2. Hardware components<br />3. Software development and maturity<br />4. Radar Propagation and Performance modeling <br />5. HF antenna array design<br />6. Test methods<br />7. Signal processing methods<br />8. Target localization and accuracy improvement including altitude estimation methods</p>
<p>This expertise shall include the ability to prepare ROM cost estimates and implementation schedules for the development, production, and sustainment of any of the above areas that apply.</p>
<p>DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The information package should include the following items that are applicable to the submitter:</p>
<p>1. Statement of interest, either system developer or critical technology elements.<br />2. Description of qualification:<br />Projects<br />Products<br />3 Identify what you feel are the critical gaps in performance of existing capability. Define radar architecture as a function of mission/target types and identify critical technology elements. Describe existing or emerging technologies that will allow filling the capability gaps. Clearly identify the technologies that have been demonstrated and where the results are supported by analysis. Provide Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessments.<br />4 Provide your assessment of the incremental development strategy for the next generation OTHR system.<br />5 Identify radar performance modeling capabilities and provide recommendations on next generation tools and development strategy<br />6 For the critical technology elements, define the method you would employ to advance the TRL to a 5 or 6.<br />7 What recommendations would you make for near term test bed experiments.<br />8 Given the government plans to instrument a test bed and potentially allow access by industry developers, what data would you need to mature your technologies in preparation for a full scale system implementation. <br />9 Provide cost information on hardware, software, and infrastructure elements. Include both nonrecurring and recurring costs of the major components at the "box level" that comprise each element, such as nonrecurring engineering design labor effort, unit hardware production costs, recurring engineering labor effort, setup costs, installation costs, site preparation costs, and maintenance costs.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract for One hundred samples to be analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase PCR) and quantitative cell culture during the pilot phase of the study with an option to analyze an additional 900 samples should the initial analyses be acceptable to The Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) Investigators. Outbreaks of influenza in healthcare facilities have occurred during influenza seasons; the pandemic has the potential to amplify transmission several fold. In order to maintain a functional healthcare system during a pandemic, both patients and healthcare workers must be protected. The experience from SARS outbreaks highlighted the importance of clear and accurate infection control recommendations in order to protect patients and healthcare personnel. Currently, the precision of recommendations is limited by a lack of studies demonstrating specific distances over which respiratory pathogens such as influenza remain infective. The Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) has initiated a study to investigate airborne infectivity of influenza over time and distance (airborne suvivability) and environmental persistence on surfaces. DHQP has a requirement for PCR analysis and quantitative cell culture analysis for influenza of air and surface samples in support of the airborne infectivity and environmental persistence projects. The environmental samples need to be analyzed by DNA methods (i.e., polymerase chain reaction, PCR) to determine the total amount of virus (both infective and non-infective) in each sample and analyzed by quantitative cell culture to determine the total amount of infective (i.e. live) virus in each sample. The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at this site for downloading when issued. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted or entertained. No questions will be questions will be answered via telephone. No hard copy of the solicitation package will be mailed. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration. The associated NAICS codes is 541711. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFQ on the Fedbizopps Website. Offers will be due 8/28/2008 by 2:00 P.M. EST at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Procurements and Grants Office; Attn: Gary Morgan ; 2920 Brandywine Road, M/S K71, Suite 3629 Atlanta, GA 30341. Offers will be accepted by e-mail. All quotes must be clearly marked on the envelope with the following: reference# 53139, Attn: Gary Morgan. All responsible sources that can meet the above requirements may submit a quote, which may be considered by the Agency. For contractual question or to submit a proposal please via e-mail contact Gary Morgan at gmorgan1@cdc.gov</p>

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Molecular Imaging Program (MIP) plans to procure on a sole source basis, the Olympus MVX Macro/Stereo Microscope with Olympus America Inc.; 3500 Corporate Parkway; Center Valley, Pennsylvania 18034. 

The supplies herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The purpose of this requirement is for the NCI laboratory to develop new optical imaging methods and probes in the Molecular Imaging program to achieve the goal of developing early diagnosis methods and cure cancer patients. NCI has found a gap between in vivo imaging and microscopic imaging is currently the biggest obstacle. To fill this gap, the NCI plans to develop a stereoscopic microscopy system equipped with a spectral fluorescence camera. The stereoscopic microscopy is state-of-the-art with the narrowest angle of 2 subjective views merge images taken simultaneously with a color camera and a spectral fluorescence camera and the excellent fluorescence detect ability as well as the exchangeability of parts and image files with current microscopic systems BX51 and IX81, made by Olympus America. NCI plans to purchase a MVX stereoscopic microscope. 

Olympus America is the only source of Olympus MVS stereoscopic microscopes in the Mid-Atlantic region. Olympus is required for cross compatibility with other microscopes, cameras, analysis software and accessories. 

PART II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

1.	Statute: 13.106-1 (b)(1) 

(b) Solicitation from a single source.

(2)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).

No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.

The following salient characteristics apply to the Olympus MVX Macro/Stereo Microscope: 

-The MVX body must be of a single optical axis design (Macro) to double the Numerical Aperture for increased resolution and fluorescence sensitivity. This should be a true Macro microscope not a stereomicroscope with an on-axis objective click stop.

The MVX body must accept the MVX tilting trinocular with the ability to switch from single axis maximum resolution macro viewing to standard stereo viewing.  

 -The MVX body must accept the binocular/trinocular head from the upright BX series of microscopes.

- The MVX body with an integrated iris diaphragm to control depth of field for viewing the egg and Microinjector needle in one focal plane.

- The MVX body must be modular to upgrade to fluorescence without having to purchase a different body.

-Flatness of the viewing field is required therefore the main objective should be a planapochromat 1x objective rather then an achromat objective

-Upgradeable to the two positions revolving nosepiece because of the need to exchange objectives without disturbing experiments in progress.

- The two-position nosepiece and optics must retain parfocality when switching.

-The base must be transmitted light Gimbal mirror system with fiber optic light source to minimize heat transfer to the base and specimen damage.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. ET on August 15, 2008. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Melissa Marino:marinome@mail.nih.gov. It is the vendors responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid, updated registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Please reference NCI-80155-MM on all correspondence.

<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov - Malinda L Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Nutritional Epidemiology Branch plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: Urinary Sugars biomarker in the OPEN study urinary samples with Quotient BioResearch, Newmarket Road, Fordham, Cambridgeshire, CB7 5WW, United Kingdom.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $12M.

The requirement is based on the need to generate data on the urinary sugars biomarker.  The role of dietary sugars in cancer occurrence is largely inconclusive due to unreliability of self- reported intake estimates of sugars.  Sugars are major contributors to energy intake; however, their intake is difficult to measure as foods high in sugars are often underreported.  Recently, a new dietary biomarker has been developed to asses the validity of self-reported sugars intake.  In two metabolic studies under strictly controlled conditions, we found that the amount of sucrose and fructose in 24-hour urine collections was highly correlated to total sugars intake.  Results showed that 200 g of total sugars intake predicted about 100 mg of sucrose and fructose in urine. 
However, these findings were based on a small group of subjects; the next step is to investigate the performance of this biomarker in a larger study with free-living individuals in which dietary assessments have been validated with established biomarkers.

Specific Project: An NCI-based biomarker study, the Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition (OPEN) Study, involved 484 men and women aged 40-69 years from Maryland.  The OPEN study collected dietary information using two self reporting dietary instruments- a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and a 24-hour dietary recall (24HR).  In addition, unbiased biomarkers of energy intake (doubly- labeled water) and protein intakes (24-hour urine nitrogen) were measured. The information on doubly-labeled water measurement is available form 93% of the participants and 77% of the collected 24-hour urines were verified for their completeness and analyzed for nitrogen. We propose to analyze sucrose and fructose in the urine collections and investigate how these relate to self-reported dietary sugars information as well as the doubly-labeled water and 24-hour urinary nitrogen biomarker measurements.  We will also use the regression equation from the metabolic study to estimate true intake based on the measured urinary values for sucrose and fructose. Creatinine in the urine collections will be measured to correct for urine concentration.

The Contractor shall perform the following: (1) nondestructively measure fructose and sucrose in human urine samples using the sequential enzymatic color assay on the Olympus AU640 automated chemistry analyzer. (2) Deliver the data to the NCI Project Officer in a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet.

Period of Performance:  Twelve (12) months from date of award.  Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this solicitation.

Quotient BioResearch is the only source known to the NCI that provides services measuring sucrose and fructose in urine.  They are experienced with handling human samples and measuring various analytes and fulfill the NCI investigators requirements for study quality. The method of analyses, that QBR uses, has been validated against a reliable source Furthermore, Quotient BioResearch uses automated autoanalyser which is characterized by high precision and reproducibility and requires very small sample volume. The OPEN study is a biomarker-based study that provides two 24-hour urinary collections and measurements of two established dietary biomarkers for energy and protein, which are rather expensive and, thus, rarely done in studies with free-living individuals.  This study provides a unique opportunity to investigate the performance of a novel biomarker against the performance of already established biomarkers.

It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Centers (COAC) on behalf of National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) to procure the services from Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Center Drive, San Diego, Ca. 92121 for the following product:

 Human CNV370-Quad DNA Analysis Kits- catalog#wg-311-1401 and wg-311-1403. 

Background:
Protocol Number: 94-AR-0105
Project Entitled: Genetics and Pathophysiology of Familial Mediterranean Fever and Related Disorders,  BEHCETS DISEASE

Summary:
 This study is designed to explore the genetics involved in diseases of intermittent fever, including familial Mediterranean fever, TRAPS, hyper-IgD syndrome, and related diseases. 
The following individuals may be eligible for this study: 1) patients 5 years of age and older with known or suspected familial Mediterranean fever, TRAPS, hyper-IgD syndrome or related disorders; 2) relatives of these patients; 3) healthy, normal volunteers 18 years of age or older; and 4) healthy patients with gout 18 years of age or older who are taking colchicine.
In addition, in order to satisfy the requirements of the Behet's disease protocol and ensure the data generated can be incorporated into an extensive pre-existing database derived using the Human CNV370-Quad DNA Analysis Kits, the proposed project must adhere to the conditions, genomic DNA, the purposed protocol must adhere to the conditions, quality of needed supplies required of integrity of experiment.    The purpose of this requirement is to process the next 800 samples of genomic DNA as a continuation our genome-wide complex genetics analysis of Behcets disease.  Through this process data is combined with data already collected; therefore, the product and platform cannot be changed. Only the Illumina beadstation automated processing robotics and automated sample scanning, for which this product can be used. Changing variable under protocol #94-AR-0105, is not possible.

Researchers are exploring possible genetic, bacterial, and viral causes of Behet's disease as well as improved drug treatment. For example, genetic studies show strong association of the gene HLA-B51 with the disease, but the exact role of this gene in the development of Behet's is uncertain. Researchers hope to identify genes that increase a person's risk for developing Behet's disease. Studies of these genes and how they work may provide new understanding of the disease and possibly new treatments.
a.)Researchers are also investigating factors in the environment, such as bacteria or viruses, which may trigger Behet's disease. They are particularly interested in whether Streptococcus, the bacterium that causes strep throat, is associated with Behet's disease. Many people with Behet's disease have had several strep infections. In addition, researchers suspect that herpes virus type 1, a virus that causes cold sores, may be associated with Behet's disease.

Finally, researchers are identifying other medicines to better treat Behet's disease. TNF inhibitors are a class of drugs that reduce joint inflammation by blocking the action of a substance called tumor necrosis factor. Although serious side effects have been reported for TNF inhibitors, they have shown some promise in treating Behet's disease. Examples of TNF inhibitors include etanercept and infliximab. Also, interferon alpha, a protein that helps fight infection, has shown promise in treating Behet's disease. Thalidomide, which is believed to be a TNF inhibitor, appears effective in treating severe mouth sores, but its use is experimental and side effects are a concern. Thalidomide is not used to treat women of childbearing age because it causes severe birth defects.

<DESC><br><br>1. The amendment states "unforeseen circumstances". Can you clarify what these circumstances<br>are at this time?<br><br>Government answer: The acquisition was under- estimated. Because of lack of resources the<br>government had to reduce our requirements.<br><br><br>2. Attachment 4 Special Provisions for Intellectual Property Rights allows the offeror to<br>state a purchase quantity that would allow the Government to obtain GPLR. Attachment 4 also<br>affects the offeror's GPLR rating for Volume III per the evaluation criteria of the<br>solicitation. Since the maximum quantity has been dramatically reduced, this could affect the<br>timeframe in which the Government would be able to purchase enough XM205s to obtain GPLR, which<br>in turn could negatively affect an offeror's rating under Volume III GPLR:<br><br>   a. Does the Government intend to change its evaluated rating for an offeror under Volume III<br>in relation to the reduced quantity that can be purchased?<br><br>Government answer: Government answer: No<br><br>   b. Or, will the Government change its evaluation criteria under Volume III?<br><br>Government answer: Government answer: No<br><br>   c. If not, will the Government allow an offeror to revise any other portions of its proposal<br>besides the pricing section.<br><br>Government answer: Yes the closing date has been extended to 15 August 2008. Please reference<br>FAR 15.208.<br><br><br>3. Amendment 0004 only allows price changes for the Ordering Period I - V unit prices. Can an<br>offeror revise any other pricing at this time, e.g. TDP, FAT, or base quantity?<br><br>Government answer: Yes the closing date has been extended to 15 August 2008. Please reference<br>FAR 15.208<br><br> <br>4. The original solicitation required the offeror to hold pricing for 60 days which would<br>expire around 12 August. Is the Government asking for another 60 days beginning 15 August?<br><br>Government answer: Yes, the 60 days would restart on 15 August 2008. If your proposal lists a<br>hard date, please revise your proposal.<br><br><br>5. Please note that in Company XYZs proposal it states, "As part of Company XYZ's submission of<br>the attached proposal, it is clearly understood that unless other arrangements are agreed to in<br>writing, the USG shall return the proposal (including hardware, technical data, and video<br>materials) in its entirety to Company XYZ within 60 days of submittal, regardless of whether or<br>not an award has been made." Company XYZ here by requests the Government provide a written<br>notification stating the additional length of time, if any, that Company XYZ's proposal and<br>hardware would be required to continue evaluation purposes.
<br>Government answer: A letter can be sent for an extension if Company XYZ proposal does not change.<br>However, if Company XYZ submits a revised proposal, the 60 days would restart. Note: Company XYZ<br>used in this question is fictitious.<br><br><b>.</b>
