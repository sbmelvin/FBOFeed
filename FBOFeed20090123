<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend contract NNA05AC42C with Integrated Science Solutions,Inc.  on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One ResponsibleSource.  The objective is to extend the performance period for up to nine months,consisting of a six month base and three one-month options.  The principal purpose ofthis contract is to provide a environmental support to NASA Ames Research Center. The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services under theEnvironmental contract for the following areas:  Environmental Compliance, PollutionPrevention and Sustainability, Wildlife and Habitat Conservation and NEPA Compliance,Site Investigation and Restoration, and Environmental Management Systems.  The purpose ofthis contract is to assure continuing compliance with numerous Federal, State, and localenvironmental laws, regulations, and policies in carrying out NASA/ARC's mission criticalprograms, projects, and activities.   The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract NNA05AC42C,for a base period of six months, from March 4, 2009 through September 3, 2009.	Thisextension will also include three one-month options, if extended will cover the period ofSeptember 4, 2009 through December 3, 2009.  The current contractor, Integrated ScienceSolutions, Inc. is considered the only contractor that can meet NASA Ames ResearchCenter's needs given the short period of performance for the extension.  Awarding a sixmonth contract to another source, at the same time recompetition of the follow-on is inprocess, would not allow for sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the seamlesscontinuity of services and cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Center'srequirements.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>COMMERCIAL ITEM: COMPLETE SCOPE AND SPECIFICATIONS WILL BE IN THE SOLICITATION PACKAGE THAT IS SCHEDULED TO BE POSTED DURING THE LAST WEEK OF JANUARY 2009. 
The contractor shall furnish and supply all labor, one fully maintained crawler tractor with operator and personnel, transportation for equipment, all operating supplies and incidentals necessary for machine site preparation for tree planting on the Emmett Ranger District. The Contractor shall furnish a Caterpillar D-5 hi-track crawler tractor (or equivalent) to be used with a government-furnished Salmon blade.  A minimum of 65% and a maximum of 80% of the ground surface will be scarified (worked) with the Salmon blade, exclusive of areas of unrippable rock, areas under live-tree drip lines, or other areas deemed unsuitable by the Forest Service representative.  The term worked is defined as the area over which the tractor has operated with the blade properly contacting the surface of the ground. Scarification is the uprooting of undesirable vegetation, and cultivation of the upper soil layers, resulting from the "tilling" action of the Salmon blade. The teeth of the blade are inserted into the soil to a depth ranging from 4 to 8 inches, measured from the mineral soil surface. The removal of large shrubs and hardwood trees will require tilling at depths greater than 8 inches.  Slopes up to 40% will be worked in a random directional manner. No ripping paths may exceed 40 feet in length.   Scarifying will generally be done working up and down the slope on slopes greater than 40%. Ripping paths on slopes over 40% will not exceed 20 feet in length.  Woody debris and logging slash will be broken down and scattered with the blade during scarification operations.  Slash piles shall be created where heavy concentrations of slash preclude or impede satisfactory scarification and scattering of the material is not practical, as described in the preceding paragraphs. Logs with a small end diameter greater than eight inches shall be scattered randomly throughout the unit.  CONTRACT TIME: Estimated start time is July/01/2009. The completion date will be October 15, 2009.  PROJECT IS LOCATED on the Emmett Ranger District of the Boise National Forest;    NAICS code: 5561730. SIZE STANDARD: $7.0 million. Project is 100 percent Small Business Set-Aside.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Acquisition Management Division (AMD), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, on behalf of the NIST/ Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, with FEI Company, of Hillsboro, Oregon, for an upgrade to NISTs existing FEI Titan 80-300 Transmission Electron Microscope, manufactured by FEI, Inc.

The subject of this acquisition is the purchase and installation of an external scan switch which is a physical upgrade to the FEI Titan 80-300  Transmission Electron Microscope.  The switch will enable the control of the instrument by external, third party data analysis packages, which NIST currently owns.  

Specifically, the upgrade will involve the installation of a new printed circuit board (PCB) to the microscope control hardware and the addition of an external scan switch box that will enable the external hardware to drive the scan coils of the microscope.  

The existing equipment and the additional equipment are commercial items.  FEI has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to that technology.  

The additional equipment must be hardware and software compatible with the existing equipment.  The existing equipment and technology are proprietary to FEI.  FEI has no distributors; therefore, they are the only source who can provide this upgrade.   

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by February 6, 2009, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Ceramics Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with ULVAC Technologies, Inc., Methuen, MA, for the purchase of an Infrared (IR) Optical Tube Furnace with Custom Quartz Tube.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST requires an Infrared (IR) Optical Tube Furnace with custom quartz tube which is a rapid heating, cold wall optical reflector furnace capable of reaching 1,200C peak and 1,000C continuous duty maximum operating temperatures.  This IR Furnace will be used to certify a high temperature Seebeck coefficient Standard Reference Material.  Therefore, the system must have the lowest uncertainty possible.  Without the temperature stability and consistent profile offered by the IR furnace, it will be difficult to stabilize the sample temperature of the samples and the sample holder.  A stable temperature is necessary to accurately measure temperature dependent properties.  In addition, this system will measure small temperature gradients along the sample.  The ULVAC IR furnace will maintain a consistent temperature gradient along the sample, allowing the measurement system to apply and accurately measure small gradients purposely placed on the samples.  Without the stability of the IR furnace, it would be extremely difficult to control and isolate these applied temperature gradients.  As a result, ULVAC Technologies, Inc., is uniquely qualified to provide the required IR Furnace.  ULVAC is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the system.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by February 9, 2009, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The Division of Epidemiology, Statistical, and Prevention Research, within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 - (1) and FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) and HHSAR 306.302-1 (a) (2) (ii), a modification to its current contract with Fisher BioServices, Rockville, Maryland, entitled, The Repository for Storage, Monitoring, and Distribution of NICHD Biological Specimens. A three month extension is necessary in order to avoid a lapse in contract performance and continue services in its operations of the repository. This modification will allow Fisher BioServices to continue uninterrupted services in supporting ongoing NICHD specimen collections until a new competitive contract can be awarded and the services transitioned. This modification is to continue services until approximately June 30, 2009 or until this new competitive contract can be awarded. A contract extension will allow NICHD to continue providing repository support to researchers for irreplaceable study collections and to transition to the selected offeror under the new competitive procurement. There are approximately 2.7 million vials of biological specimens that have been collected under various research protocols. Adequate storage space is required for 1,250,000 vials stored at -20 degrees C; 1,200,000 at -70 degrees C; 215,000 stored in liquid nitrogen (LN). A break in these services of a storage repository for storing, monitoring and distribution would result in disastrous consequences to the specimens. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. If any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit, within 45 days of publication of this notice, three (3) copies (plus an electronic copy to ls59u@nih.gov) to: Mrs. Lynn Salo, Contracting Officer, NICHD CMB, NIH, 6100 Executive Building, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (or overnight courier: 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland 20852). Phone number: 301-435-6962 and FAX number: 301-402-3676. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), HHSAR 306.302-1(a) (2) (ii). No collect calls will be accepted. This requirement is defined as code 541712 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).</p>

This notice of intent isnot a request for competitive quotes and the proposed/contract action is forsupplies or services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only onesource. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respondto the requirement or submit quotes. Quotes received prior to the award datewill be considered by the Government.A determination by the Government not tocompete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solelywithin the discretion of the government. Information received will normally beconsidered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct acompetitive procurement. The design of this part is unstable. Engineering,manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required designobjectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because thepart has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance duringtests or service use. These changes will render the present part obsolete andunusable in its present configuration. Limited acquisition from the presentsource is anticipated pending configuration changes. The subject item requiresGovernment source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flightcritical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate tosupport acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previouslyapproved by the government for this item have been solicited. The time requiredfor approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayedpending approval of a new source.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Government is seeking to lease approximately 4,000 rentable square feet of office and related space, of which approximately 900 RSF is storage and workroom with plumbing and vent.  The current leased space is separated into three spaces, 3,064, 344 and 587 RSF, and this requirement may be either contiguous space or space separated similar to the above.

D. PAST PERFORMANCE: Firm must demonstrate its past performance in accomplishment of similar work. Firm must submit information for current relevant contracts and subcontracts including the name, address, and telephone number of references. (Relevancy is defined in the DOD guide to collection and use of past performance as information that has a logical connection with the matter under consideration and application time span.) Submit information for all relevant contracts and subcontracts started or completed within the past 5 years (measured from the date of this synopsis). Firms may include supporting information in the proposal, such as letters of commendation from clients, on past performance on recent similar contracts. Include information on problems encountered in prior contracts and discuss actions taken to remedy unsatisfactory performance. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry regarding quality, cost control, and timeliness of work will be reviewed. Past DOD performance data available to the Government through the A-E Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) will also be evaluated.  THE FOLLOWING SECONDARY CRITERIA WILL BE USED AS TIEBREAKERS, IF NECESSARY: e. VOLUME OF PAST DOD CONTRACTS AWARDED TO FIRM: Work previously awarded to the firm by DOD will be reviewed with the objective of effecting equitable distribution of contracts among equally qualified firms. F. GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY OF FIRM RELATIVE TO THE WORKSITE: Firms based in or having branch offices in Florida with lower mobilization and demobilization costs will be given preference, provided there is an adequate number of qualified firms for consideration. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement and wishing to be considered must submit one copy of SF 330, Part I, for the proposed combined team (firm or joint venture and all subcontractors), and one separate copy of SF 330, Part II, for the firm or joint venture and each subcontractor. Submittal packages must be received in this office at the address indicated below, no later than 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time on 24 February 2009. Submittals received after this date and time will not be considered. Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective response to this announcement are not desired. The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the CCR before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense. The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered. (The CCR's web site may be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov.) Small and small disadvantaged business firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507. If a large business firm is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract out, the Corps of Engineers floors for subcontracting are 40% to small business concerns; 18% to small disadvantaged business concerns; 5.8% to women-owned small business concerns; 10% for HUBZONE concerns; and 2% to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business. The term floors is used instead of goals as the Corps of Engineers objective is to exceed the percentages rather than merely meet the percentages. Large firms should keep these floors in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor's socio-economic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications. The NAICS code is 541330. The size standard is $4,500,000. Responses to this ad should be in writing only; telephone calls and personal visits are discouraged. The required forms shall be submitted to the following address: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CESAJ-EN-TA, 701 San Marco Boulevard, Jacksonville, FL 32207-8175, or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CESAJ-EN-TA, P.O. Box 4970, Jacksonville, FL 32232-0019. NOTE: If the offeror intends to hand deliver the offer, access to this building is controlled by security personnel. Visitors requiring access must present a drivers license, current passport, or similar positive identification. Facsimile copies are not acceptable. Security personnel are neither Government employees nor Government contractor employees. For purposes of determining whether an offer is late, delivery into the hands of security personnel will not constitute delivery to the Government. In order to ensure delivery to the Government, persons hand-delivering offers should call the contract specialist whose name appears in the procurement and ask the specialist to send someone to the security desk to take possession of the offer. This is not a request for proposal. The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense. The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered. Call 1-888-227-2423 for more information or visit the CCRs website at http://www.ccr.gov. You must be registered in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in order to receive an award from this solicitation.

<DESC><p>OFFADD: AFCA/EAC, 203 W. Losey St, Rm. 1100, Scott AFB IL 62225-5200<br />SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />DESC: This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis. Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. The government is currently conducting a market survey of products that can meet the requirements for senior leader video conferencing (VC).
<p>Senior leaders in the AF require a Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) desktop/office VC solution that supplies an acceptable quality of service/experience. This does not imply High Definition capability nor does it preclude it. In planning on future use cases the equipment needs to be dual capable in that it can operate over Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and can operate over Internet Protocol (IP) without major hardware/software upgrades or hidden costs.</p>
<p>Some required features include the support of bridging, support of MCU with at least a capacity for 15 geographically separated endpoints (Europe, Hawaii, US, etc). One-touch communications and Ad Hoc VC sessions are also desired. The system also needs to possess a centralized control and management capability.</p>
<p>Additionally, the system has to adhere to all applicable instructions and documentation to include DoD Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) 2007 and the soon to be finalized UCR 2008 and be IPv6 capable.</p>
<p>ISDN Specific Requirements:<br />Utilize typical 384Kb circuit to transmit studio quality VTC traffic</p>
<p>Internet Protocol Specific Requirements:<br />Real-time traffic over IP utilizes Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) that rides on top of UDP. The AF views opening all random UPD ports to be a security risk that is unacceptable, therefore the product would need to have some kind of firewall traversal capability.</p>
<p>The AF and DoD are moving towards Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) with a variation that meets DoD mission needs called Assured Services Session Initiation Protocol (AS-SIP). The product does not have a requirement to perform AS-SIP as it is still in its infancy but the government may want to upgrade the product to the specification in the future. However, the product should be both SIP and H.323 capable.</p>
<p>At a minimum, a vendor's RFI submission should fully answer the following questions:<br />1. Is the product Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certified?<br />2. Is the product IPv6 capable today?<br />3. Does the proposed capability/concept rely on any proprietary standards to meet any of the requirements?<br />4. Does the solution meet the vision/requirements "as is" or is specific development required?<br />5. Is the product compliant with Unified Capability Requirements (UCR) 2007 and will it be upgraded to be compliant with UCR 2008 when it is release if need be?<br />6. Does the vendor offer administrative/user support capabilities?<br />7. What are the expected cost breakdowns (e.g., hardware, development, licenses, installation, and "support" desk).<br />8. Does the vendor's solution have any awards and/or relevant success stories/testimonials?<br />9. Does the vendor have any plans to work with the DoD to develop AS-SIP for their product?<br />10. Is the product(s) National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) NIAP certified?<br />11. Does the product interoperate with other vendors? If so, is any functionality lost as a result?<br />12. Are there any requirements that cannot be met and why?</p>
<p>Vendors responding to this RFI who currently can make solutions available to the USAF are requested to provide a description of capabilities NLT 30 days from publication of this notice. Please list Government contracts that apply. Potential vendors may express interest, make comments, and ask questions via electronic mail or fax to the Air Force Communications Agency, Network Services Engineering Branch at afca.enne@us.af.mil or FAX (618) 229-5544. All comments and questions must be in writing and must identify the company source, contact person, e-mail address, and telephone number.<br />EMAILADD: afca.enne@us.af.mil <br />EMAILDESC: Air Force Communications Agency, Services Engineering Branch, Scott AFB IL</p>

<DESC><p>The Technical Support Office of the United States Air Force Band, Bolling AFB, DC is seeking sources for a service agreement. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational and planning purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result of this RFI. The Air Force will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.
<p>This FedBizOps notice is an announcement seeking market information on business capable of providing the services as described herein. Bolling AFB is currently conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.</p>
<p>The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Should a future requirement(s) evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated the period of performance will be a base year with four (4) one-year options pending. For the purpose of this RFI the anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330, Engineering Services and the size standard is $4.5M.</p>
<p>It is anticipated the vendor will provide a service plan based on a pre-determined number of "units."

<p>As an example, the USAF Band might request to contract for 25,000 units. This is either 25,000 hours of time, or parts and materials equal to the cost of that time, or (more likely) a combination of the two. In this example, the vendor would submit a bid that indicates the cost of providing that much time. As an example, if the vendor decided that an hour of time equated to $150, the cost of the contract would be $150 x 25,000 = $3.75M.</p>
<p>The vendor should be able to provide the following services, to be used incrementally in "Units."</p>
<p>I. Maintenance agreement: maintaining, repairing, and replacing recording studio and live sound equipment.<br />a. Equipment lists will be attached at the end of the document<br />b.

<DESC>BACKGROUNDThe Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) Office provides leveraged technology forMission Directorates, Programs and Projects through investments and technologypartnerships with industry, academia, government agencies and national laboratories. Asone of NASAs Mission Support Offices, IPP supports all four Mission Directorates and hasprogram offices at each of the ten NASA Centers. IPP partnership goals include providingfor an increased range of technology solutions, a broadened technology portfolio,improved cost avoidance, accelerated development and maturation of technologies and alarger pool of qualified commercial providers. The Facilitated Access to the Space Environment for Technology Development and Training(FAST) program has been established within the Innovation Incubator program element ofIPP to increase technology infusion by creating more opportunities to advance thematurity of key technologies thereby reducing the risk of adopting those technologies. The FAST program will facilitate technology maturation by providing access tospace-environment testing, which is a key step in moving technologies from a lower tohigher level of readiness.  The FAST program will focus on providing access tomicro-gravity or reduced-gravity environments on commercially available parabolicaircraft flights initially, and later suborbital and orbital flights.  The FAST programalso encourages commercial development and competition by using commercially availablespace-related services when possible such as the Microgravity Flight Services Contractfor parabolic flights and other suborbital and orbital flight services as they emerge.PURPOSE OF NOTICEThis announcement solicits interest from US private industry, individuals, academic orresearch institutions, NASA organizations and other government agencies.  The IPP alsoencourages partnerships between any of those entities.	For the FAST program activitiesthe IPP plans to enter into Agreements for research collaborations under the authority ofthe National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended ("Space Act").  Agreementswith external organizations will be in the form of a Non-reimbursable Space ActAgreements (SAA) where each party funds their own participation in the research effortand there is no exchange of funds.  In the case of internal NASA organizations, aMemorandum of Agreement (MOA) will be established to define the effort. DESCRIPTIONThe FAST program will provide opportunities for emerging technologies to be tested in thespace environment and is targeted toward technologies that: 	Support NASA's missions but are not yet mature enough for adoption into NASAsprograms with acceptable risk; and 	Might not otherwise be tested due to lack of funding such as those developed byprivate companies including SBIR/STTR contractors and other small companies, universitiesor research institutions and NASA projects in early development. The current focus is on testing in micro-gravity, reduced-gravity or variable-gravityconditions on parabolic aircraft flights. The FAST program intends to provide futuresuborbital and orbital flight opportunities for technology testing when those commercialservices are offered and if funding is available. Projects selected under this programmay be considered for additional parabolic, suborbital or orbital flight opportunitieswithout further competition.  Generally, testing on parabolic flights will be required asa precursor to suborbital and orbital flight tests.Implementation of flight tests for selected proposals under this call is subject toavailability of appropriated funds.NASA will purchase commercial reduced-gravity flight weeks and provide space on theseflights for selected projects.	There are typically four flights per flight week witheach flight including 40 to 60 parabolic trajectories.	Each parabola providesapproximately 25 seconds of reduced-gravity time. Microgravity and reduced gravityconditions such as lunar gravity (.16 g) or Mars gravity (.38 g) as well as other partialgravity levels can be provided on parabolic aircraft flights. The aircraft willexperience increased gravity levels (~ 2gs) in between parabolas. NASA flight weeks will generally be conducted out of Ellington Field in Houston, Texasbut other locations (such as Cleveland, Ohio) are possible.  Proposers should providemargin in their travel budgets to account for an unlikely but possible change in flightlocation or postponement of a flight week.  A flight week typically involves a testreadiness review on the first day (Monday) and then one flight per day for four days(Tuesday through Friday).  Project teams can request one, two, three or four flight daysfor their project in their proposal. The aircraft volume will allow for relatively largeequipment and could accommodate several test personnel for each project, if required. However, it is recommended that you request the minimum number of flight days, theminimum aircraft volume and the minimum number of on-board participants required to meetyour objectives.   The FAST program would like to accommodate as many projects aspossible and so the extent of requested flight time, volume, personnel or other specialneeds may be a factor in the selection process. Technologies selected for reduced-gravity environment testing aboard the parabolicaircraft flights must meet equipment design requirements as determined by the NASAReduced Gravity Office.  You should refer to JSC Reduced Gravity Program Users Guideand Experiment Design Requirements and Guidelines which can be found at:http://jsc-aircraft-ops.jsc.nasa.gov/Reduced_Gravity/guides.html A new space experiment support system developed by NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) andSpace Florida may be available to support proposed investigations.  FASTRACK provides arack structure and standard mid-deck locker accommodations with demonstrated interfacecompatibility aboard the reduced gravity aircraft.  Proposers who wish to consider use ofthis capability should contact Alexis Hongamen of the KSC IPP Office at 321-867-3107(email Alexis.Hongamen-1@nasa.gov).It should be noted that all proposals will be treated as proprietary information and allreasonable efforts will be made to protect proprietary information in the course of theflight-testing process.  However, the aircraft will be carrying multiple projects at thesame time and various projects and project personnel will occupy the aircraft cabin andpre-flight preparation areas at the same time.	Aircraft operations personnel mayparticipate in loading, securing and unloading project hardware.  Video recording andphotography of activities may be conducted by NASA, aircraft personnel and other projectteams on-board the aircraft and in preparation areas.  These photographs and videorecordings may be posted on public websites and in other publications.	Project teamsshould take precautions to avoid the inadvertent disclosure of their own proprietaryinformation.  For all selected projects, NASA will publicize the name of the company ororganization involved with a brief description of the subject technology and may usephotographs and video recordings of related flight test activity in public briefings andpublications. DETAILS OF THE OPPORTUNITYEligibilityUnited States private companies, individuals, academic or research institutions, NASAorganizations and other US government agencies or partnerships between any those entitiesmay submit proposals.Type of Projects SoughtThe project must be an effort to accomplish reduced-gravity testing of a technology ofinterest and value to NASAs missions, programs or projects. Criteria for selection areprovided in the next section. A listing of NASA Mission Directorate Technology FocusAreas is provided in Attachment A.  Technologies must be within the Technology ReadinessLevel (TRL) range of 4 to 6 and should be ready for reduced-gravity environment testingat the time of the proposal. A definition of Technology Readiness Levels is provided inAttachment B. There must be a reasonable expectation that the reduced-gravity testingwill significantly contribute to advancing the maturity of the technology.  This programis not intended to support further laboratory development of technologies. FundingThe FAST program will purchase reduced-gravity flight time and provide this at no cost tothe selected projects.	All other project costs are the responsibility of the proposingentity including the preparation of the technology test hardware, compliance with flighttest and aircraft requirements, preparation for and participation in flight readinessreviews, transportation of hardware and travel for project personnel.  Any requiredflight physicals and physiological training for testing participants are also theresponsibility of the proposing entity.  If flights are cancelled due to weather ormechanical problems, every effort will be made to reschedule those flights.  Ifadditional travel or transportation is required for rescheduled flights, those additionalcosts are the responsibility of the project team, not the FAST program.ScheduleJanuary 26, 2009	Call for proposals March 20, 2009	Proposal deadlineMay 1, 2009		Selection Announcement (pending availability of appropriatedfunds)June 1, 2009		Space Act Agreements and MOAs completedMay-July 2009	Project teams prepare for flight-testing and submit required		 		      documentation to the JSC Reduced Gravity OfficeAugust 2009		First parabolic aircraft flights occurSelectionThe IPP Office at NASA Headquarters will evaluate proposals in coordination withrepresentatives from the Mission Directorates, based on the selection criteria identifiedwithin this call.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI), or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" may be used in this RFI, your response will be as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This RFI is issued for the purpose of identifying information on implementing on-line E-Learning format training curricula. 

This announcement is for market research and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). Essentially, it is expected that in the follow-on procurement strategy, the Government will be looking curricula that would offer the "best overall value" to the Government (mission function, ease of integration and operational use, Total Cost of Ownership, etc), not necessarily the lowest procurement cost. However, affordability will be a crucial factor. The following agency needs are provided to assist in conducting this RFI. 

NGA's  James R Clapper School of Leadership and Professional (SLPD) development is seeking to build an internal on-line training program.  In support of moving training to an E-Learning format the SLPD is looking for sources that can supply on-line training curriculum in the following areas:

Emotional Intelligence
Ethics
Customer Relationship Management
Quality Customer Service
Interpersonal Communications
Listening
Writing (Beginning through Advanced)
Microsoft Office Suite (Beginning through Advanced)
Briefing and Presentation Techniques and Strategies (Beginning through Advanced)

In addition to supplying a detailed description of the courses, please provide an approximate degree of how customizable your curriculum is and an approximate cost.

<RESPDATE>022309
<CONTACT>Neil D Wikstrom, Senior Contract Administrator, Phone 303-384-6960, Fax 303-384-6901, Email neil_wikstrom@nrel.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND
Wind speed measurements are critical to validating 100-meter wind resources; developing wind plant power curves for use in integration studies; improving wind power forecasting; validating, calibrating and improving mesoscale models for use in integration studies; and understanding micro-effects in wind plants.  

The high resolution state wind maps produced under the aegis of NREL and others since 1999 have greatly facilitated wind energy development in the United States.  By highlighting the areas most likely to have a good wind resource the wind maps have helped focus wind energy development efforts and inform public policy related to wind energy development.

For historical reasons the wind maps developed to date are referenced at 50 meters above ground level (AGL). Back in the late 1990s 50 meters was a common hub height for utility scale wind turbines.  Thus the maps provided the most accurate information available at the most useful height.  In recent years utility scale wind turbine hub heights have increased to 80-100 meters.  Recent wind resource assessment research indicates that the wind resource at 80-100 meters often differs markedly from what simple extrapolation from 50 meters would indicate.

A new set of wind maps is required that show the wind resource at 80-100 meters to enable continued identification of good wind resource areas.  This is especially important in areas such as the Great Lakes region where the modest wind resource at 50 meters AGL has, until recently, generally precluded large scale wind energy projects.  Wind development in regions such as this can help reduce the new transmission needed to achieve the US Department of Energys 20% Wind Scenario.  These new wind maps in turn require good data at 80 m, 100 m and above.

Both wind power forecasting and meso-scale modeling for integration studies typically rely on single wind speed location to estimate the power output from wind plants that include many turbines.  These wind plant power curves are often terrain dependent and not well understood.  

Through this Sources Sought notice, NREL is seeking organizations with tall tower wind time series data sets for use in validating meso-scale models and validating wind farm power curves.  This notice seeks sources that can provide data sets that focus on wind speed measurements to help validate 100-meter wind maps in the Great Lakes region and the development of wind plant power curves, but wind measurements that may help the mesoscale modeling process and NRELs understanding of micro-effects will also be considered.
Interested companies are encouraged to respond to this announcement as soon as possible with complete response information.  Responses should include:
  Name and address of the company
  Point of contact including name, title, phone and email address
  Description of the data sets that currently meet the requirements (general location, speed sensor height(s), monitoring period.)

QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
The offered wind data sets must have the following characteristics:
1.  The data set must include data taken at a minimum of 70m AGL
2.  The data set must include data for at least 9 months
3.  The data averaging interval must be 10 minutes or less
4.  Minimum sampling interval is 5 seconds (0.2 Hz)
5.  The data must contain the actual measurements.  It may not include interpolated or fill-in data
6.  At a minimum the data must include wind speed, wind speed standard deviation, and wind direction.  Wind direction is required for at least one level.

<CONTACT>Claudia Rivera, Contract Specialist, Phone 212-264-5244, Fax 212-264-0588, Email claudia.rivera@gsa.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND NOTICE OF INTENT.  GSA is considering the award of a sole source contract to SMITHGROUP Inc. in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1, which is entitled Only one responsible source and other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.  The anticipated contract will include requirements for services needed to update a Feasibility Study prepared for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), New York City Archives.  This contract may also include an option for subsequent design services.  Under a contract with NARA SMITHGROUP Inc. prepared the original study.  The following provides the current Scope of Work for this effort: PROJECT DESCRIPTION - The renovation of space in the basement for a Classroom, on the 3rd floor for archival storage, and on the 4th floor for administrative offices and an educational resource center with research rooms with public access computer capacity for 15  20 people.  The areas are indicated in the attached design intent drawings numbered SK-1, SK-2 & SK-3.  While the administrative, classroom and educational resource areas located on the 4th floor and basement levels will require standard office environmental conditions, specific design concepts must be provided for the Archival storage area to be located on the 3rd floor. The specific design concepts shall be in compliance with NARA 1571 Archival Storage Standard.  Providing an appropriate environment for the Archival storage area is a priority concern. All spaces shall comply with GSA PQ100 or NARA 1571 Archival Storage Standard, whichever is more stringent.  GSA Building Preservation Plan (BPP) for the subject property shall be used as a guiding document for preservation treatments.  BACKGROUND - In October of 2004 NARA requested 
a sustentative Preservation Assessment to establish whether the 4th floor space could be brought to meet NARAs guidelines for archival storage.  Feasibility Study Cost Study dated March 11, 2005, Hazardous Material Inspection Report dated January 4, 2005, and Appendix dated March 11, 2005 prepared by SMITHGROUP will be made available upon request. SCOPE OF SERVICES - The A/E shall produce a comprehensive pre-design survey report including design concepts which compliment the attached design-intent drawings.  For each concept furnish cost estimates identifying cost-driven special construction and recommend where cost savings can be achieved.  Furnish separate cost estimates for the Archival storage area.  Provide a cost analysis for providing a Bally Box on the 3rd floor.  Provide a cost analysis of a relaxation of the humidity requirements while maintaining temperatures at 1571 levels for the 3rd floor storage area.  Each design concept shall allow for the assignment of solid cost estimates for the Shell space of the building (GSAs cost) and the Tenant Improvements (NARAs cost) while considering economic solutions. All cost estimates shall be summarized by Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) divisions.  An initial Meeting shall occur with the A/E, the GSA and NARAs program, engineering and preservation staff to confirm that all parties fully understand NARAs requirements and flexibility with this project, at which time IT & Data Capacity needs will be discussed for the basement classroom.  Interim discussions during the study shall occur to allow NARA and GSA the opportunity to review concepts that will be recommended and offer input on acceptable and potential cost savings before the final report is submitted.  The Scope of Services shall include, but not necessarily limited to survey of existing areas as noted in the project description, digital photos to record all items, a visual examination of identified problems, interview of appropriate staff and Building Manager(s), preparing a draft and final report (with digital pictures), documenting findings, obtaining plans and other pertinent information, and establishing contacts. The report shall address the following specific emphasis and/or items of concern: This building is heated and air conditioned with fan coil units.  These units are water-based cooling and heating systems. The system consists of an outdoor 'water chiller connected to a number of indoor fan coil units. The proposed water chiller for the potential archival space could be located on the roof adjacent to the proposed stack area. The fan draws air from the room, blows it over the heated or cooled water-to-air heat exchanger, (coil) and returns it to the room. Each of these units has a number of pipes beside it that move water from one unit to another and ultimately to and from the outdoor water chiller. These pipes run floor to ceiling in the desired space. The rented space above the proposed archival space also has pipes for their fan coil units directly above this space.  The use of fan coil units in the archival stack area should not be considered for the following reasons:  Fan coil units can be problematic when used in archival stack areas. Maintenance needs to be done at the unit level, such as filter changes, and the cleaning of the condensation pipes. Since fan coil units cool the air, they need to have condensation pans, drip traps, and drain lines. Aside from the obvious problems of leaking and clogging, these units have been known to develop microbial growths. The water running between units is pressurized, which not only increases the potential for leaks, it also makes the leak location unpredictable.  It is also hard to predict and questionable whether or not these fan coil units will be able to maintain NARA's set points keeping within the allowable fluctuation levels. Tempered air from the coil fan units is also difficult to humidify; dehumidify, and to filter. There is also some question about the capability to distribute the heat and air conditioning evenly throughout the rooms. GSA has a copy of NARA 1571. They do believe that the HVAC system can be humidified dehumidified, and filtered in the ducts, at the entry to those areas that need to meet those Criteria.  The number of water pipes present in each area due to the use of fan coil units is greater here than it is in other archival facilities. This increases the potential for water problems, especially since these pipes are pressurized. Providing gutters and jacketed pipes will be especially important to prevent water damaged records. In an effort to assess whether this environmental system could be utilized for storing cultural property, we asked the Smithsonian representative about their environmental system. The Smithsonian maintains 70F and 50% Relative Humidity (RH), which is higher than NARA's maximum temperature of 65F and RH set point in the 35-45% RH range. In order to meet their environmental requirements, the Smithsonian built thermo-barrier on their exterior walls that are 12 to 18 thick and installed a new, independent HVAC system. With windows on three sides of the space that would serve as the NARA stack and the lack of insulation in the walls of this 1907 building, the exterior climatic conditions are expected to affect the capability to maintain the appropriate interior environment. A similar thermo-barrier and a dedicated environmental system are likely also necessary for the NARA space. If such thermo-barriers are required, the floor space will be reduced 2-3 feet in both length and width. The sprinkler system will need to be improved to meet NARA standards. There are too few sprinklers and they are spaced too far apart. The ceilings could be lower in order to cover up the existing sprinkler pipes; however, it would be best to minimize the lowering of this ceiling height to allow for higher shelving. There must be an 18 space between the top shelf and the sprinkler heads. There are a large number of windows around all of the rooms where the records will be processed and served. All of the windows where records are being used need to be filtered to remove ultraviolet light. This filtering can be achieved by the use of scrims, which can allow some light in through the windows while removing the deleterious light rays. Records should not be left exposed to light unnecessarily. Displaying original records would require specially precautions and possibly additional light blocking screens at the windows. Assess specific needs for archival storage and identify what is needed to create an appropriate environment, compliant with NARA 1571 Archival Storage Standard, based on the site infrastructure, thermal-barrier walls and independent HVAC- system that will likely be required. Describe the concept for providing Heating/Cooling/Dehumidification on a 24-hour basis including available options to reduce operating costs. Assess options and costs for improving the building envelope including blocking windows, using modular structural insulated panels made with poured-in-place urethane in lieu of increasing insulation and creating vapor barrier for temperature and humidity control, or otherwise protecting records from UV radiation. Assess requirements for emergency preparedness, security, environmental monitoring and maintenance, integrated pest management. Stack and processing areas requiring an independent systems, assess the 3rd floor archive space to determine how NARA. 1571 requirements can be met, at what cost and schedule. Assess measures that could be taken and costs to increase the existing floor load capacity for higher shelving in the archival storage area. Assess the risk to records in locating archival storage space next to electrical and telephone storage closets and provide cost estimates to make the existing walls two-hour fire rated. Include detailed pan protection and/or leak detection concepts. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: - Eighteen (18) copies of a draft report for NARA and GSA comments prior to Eighteen (18) copies of the final report.

Responses to this RFI should be unclassified. Sources responding should indicate their business size in relation to the following NAICS code: 334220. Direct all questions regarding this survey to the attention of Ronald Asan, Telephone number 732-427-2130, Fax number 732-427-4176, Email: Roanld.Asan@us.army.mil. All requests for further information must be via email, telephonic requests for additional information will not be honored.<BR><BR>The Program Manager Sequoyah, under the Product Director, Army Space Program Office (ASPO) of Program Executive Officer (PEO) Intelligence and Electronics Warfare and Sensors (IEW&S) has a mandate to develop and procure automated foreign language translation products for both speech and text translation in a variety of languages and on a variety of platforms. In partial response to this mandate, PM Sequoyah will plan and execute developmental testing and operational testing of such products over the life of the program, beginning in FY09.  The purpose of this market survey is to identify industry best practices for the testing and evaluation of these products. In fulfilling the many requirements for material support tasked to the Sequoyah Program Office different solution sets (configurations, languages, and domains) will be considered.<BR><BR>Interested parties should consider the following information about the products to be evaluated in response to this RFI:<BR>a)	PM Sequoyah is interested in developing software products in the following configurations: Two-Way Speech-to-Speech (2WS2S), Two-Way Text-to-Text (2WT2T), One-Way Text-to-Speech (1WT2S), and One-Way Speech-to-Text (1WS2T) translations systems.  Two-Way products would perform translation from English to target language and target language to English.  1WT2S products would perform translation from English to target language.  1WS2T products would perform translation from target language to English.<BR>b)	Hardware Platforms will include handheld (HH) portable devices and laptop/tablet (PC) mobile devices operating in a stand-alone mode, as well as server platforms operating in a web-enabled mode.  These platforms could be operating with Windows or LINUX operating systems.<BR>c)	Target languages may include, but will not be limited to, Iraqi Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, Pashto, and Dari.<BR>d)	Products will be targeted for use within specified domains.  Examples of such domains include Checkpoint Operations, Base Security, Convoy Operations, Tactical Questioning, Internment and Detention, Combat Life Saving, and Combat Operations focused on Counterinsurgency.<BR><BR>PM Sequoyah will conduct test and evaluation at multiple points in the development and acquisition processes.  During Developmental Testing, testing will be required at the component level of the products, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Machine Translation (MT), and Speech Synthesis (SS) as appropriate to the specific product.  Tests will consider both accuracy/adequacy and speed of operation.  During Operational Testing (and also during Developmental Testing), testing will be required to assess the overall system performance in performing tasks.<BR><BR>Respondents should specify for all of the various kinds of tests their experience and recommendations for procedures, methodologies, facilities, data requirements, and metrics for effective testing and evaluation.  Maturity and demonstrated validity of test procedures should be described.  Criticism of known test metrics, e.g., shortfalls, reliability/consistency of results, complexity/costliness of implementation, etc., may be included.  Recognized industry practices for evaluating quality and accuracy should be noted.  Metrics for system performance, especially, should be recommended that correlate well with human assessments of performance, e.g. Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) ratings.  A unique need for this program is to assess whether a non-linguist user assisted by a Sequoyah product is able to accomplish the same tasks (within a specified domain) as a linguist rated at a particular ILR level.  If such a user is able to accomplish the same tasks as a linguist with an ILR rating of X, then we would say the Sequoyah product performs at ILR level X.  PM Sequoyah is particularly interested in respondents recommendations for metrics and procedures for performing this assessment.  Recommendations of new metrics/methodologies that demonstrate a high degree of correlation to the ILR linguist evaluation scheme are of great interest of the Program Office.  Metrics/test methodologies that correlate well to a quantifiable scale based on a discernable language proficiency are also of interest.

The mission includes, but is not limited to weapon and ammunition innovation and technology maturation, design, development, production, maintenance and life cycle support.  The ability to integrate different models together can dramatically alter the way we do business at ARDEC.  Currently, within ARDEC, each organization uses a subset of modeling tools in order to accomplish their tasks within their competency areas.  In the development of advanced systems, a variety of modeling and simulation competencies and tools are required and collaboration and cooperation amongst organizations and required competencies is crucial.   The ability to streamline some of the interconnections between different applications allows us the opportunity to streamline our business processes, and increase productivity. An architecture to help make this integration seamless and still more powerful is a primary goal.

<DESC>Description.This is not an announcement of a solicitation.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL), has a need for groundwater sampling capsule filters for use in Water Resource Discipline (WRD) water sampling and testing programs.  

This RFI is issued for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals, Request for Quotation, or a commitment by the government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not serve as proposals, bids or offers, which could be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Although information gathered under this RFI may be used to secure funding and initiate a contract, the government does not intend to enter into a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information.  The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary and shall not constitute a fee to the government.  The main purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to determine if suppliers have the capability to manufacture capsule filters with the listed specifications.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee participation in future U.S. Geological Survey activities.

Background.The United States Geological Survey (USGS), WRD, NWQL strives to maintain national consistency in the all of the environmental samples collected by their personnel.  The scientific analytical data from these samples is available and presented for use by other agencies and the public.  For this reason, the National Field Supply Service (NFSS) was established to ensure that all water-quality sample data collection and processing is done using the same, quality-assured (QA) supplies at all data-collection locations.  Many constituents found in the environment are measured at very low concentrations that require the collection and processing of samples be done using stringent, clean protocols, along with supplies of a known quality so as not to compromise the integrity of samples or scientific data.
The supplies that are used by WRD personnel for collecting and processing water-quality samples undergo rigorous QA testing prior to being selected.  QA testing is then routinely performed on each new lot of supply items as they are received from the vendor to assure that quality is being maintained.  

Scope.This RFI seeks to identify suppliers that can manufacture a capsule filter to meet the specifications and quality assurance standards listed below. 
FILTER, GROUNDWATER SAMPLING CAPSULES: 0.45 mSPECIFICATIONS:Filter Media: Supor, Versapor or equivalentFilter Housing: PolypropyleneInlet/Outlet Connections: Stepped Hose Barb accepts " - " ID tubingVent Valve: On inletFiltration Area: at least 600 cmMaximum Operating Pressure: 60 psiMaximum Operating Temperature: 60 C
Remove all labeling from the capsule itself and pad print or affix a label to the casing of the capsule so as not to interfere with the flow path of the water with the following information: "MANUFACTURER'S NAME, LOT#XXXX, PART #XXXX, 0.45um, OUTLET".  This information will be pad printed on the outlet end using black or blue ink and a bold font or affixed to the capsule so that the label will not peel off or be destroyed during or after contact with water.  Information labeling and ink will be waterproof.
Each order must be from all one lot of media and housing material and batch and include a certificate of compliance/analysis with each shipment.  Minimum lot size required is 4,500 filters per media lot.

<a href="mailto:barry.sayer@amedd.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>Description<BR><BR>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), on behalf of the Joint Task Force National Capital Region  Medical (JTF CapMed) and TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to support efforts to analyze the anticipated initial outfitting and transition contract that assists affected NCR medical facilities to relocate as directed by the Defense Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) law.   The anticipated contract would encompass a significant range of performance-based services needed to open a new world class healthcare facility. These efforts include, but are not limited to, hospital transition, planning, provisioning/installing materials, provisioning/installing furniture, provisioning/installing medical equipment, and moving medical equipment to support one newly renovated and one new military medical facility in the NCR.  The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) and a new community hospital to be built at Fort Belvoir, VA are the focal points of these requirements. This RFI is intended to solicit information from industry to assist the Government analysis of this project and provide commercial insight on holistic performance-based solutions, best practices, possible contractual arrangements and potential issues.  <BR><BR>BRAC law requires construction of the two facilities to be completed by September 2011.  Historically, providing the resources required to accomplish the significant range of services was accomplished by assigning additional personnel to a specific project site (Health Facility Project Officers), through interim manpower allocations (internal reassignments of in-house staff), or by hiring temporary employees for specific support (logistics managers).  While these methods were successful in a low volume environment, they will not support the requirements of the JTF.  Therefore, a new holistic approach is being considered to include a variety of tasks under one contractual vehicle. <BR><BR>The Government desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following questions and issues related to the initial outfitting and transition of military medical facilities. When addressing these items respondents should consider the size and scope of the requirements, which will include the outfitting of two large military installation facilities with fluid construction completion dates that may include the provisioning of 85,000 (notional) items of medical and non-medical furniture/equipment/supplies/materials. <BR><BR>(1) Have other similar (size, scope) initial outfitting and transition projects implemented a holistic approach that includes project management, provision of specified medical, non-medical, IT, and furniture/furnishings, relocation of existing equipment, warehousing of new and existing equipment, installation and technical inspection of equipment, training and turnover of equipment? <BR>(2) Is there a template or format that would best identify outfitting requirements?  <BR>(3) Given a list of 85,000 (notional) furniture/equipment/supplies/materials along with standard project management, moving, installation, and training labor costs, what pricing arrangement(s) and method(s) would be best suited for the project? <BR>(4) How would provisioning and installation best be accomplished? Would the company provision and warehouse the items or follow a just-in-time approach to install furniture and equipment with minimal storage time?<BR>(5) What best practices have been implemented for delivery and installation of equipment prior to technical testing and turnover to the customer (i.e., Government)? Does the contractor maintain control of the equipment? How do contractors ensure the security of delivered equipment prior to customer acceptance? Would this security expectation change if the delivery location is a Government installation? <BR>(6) Would a contractor in the initial outfitting and transition competitive space typically provide and install IT equipment to include desktop/laptop computers, printers, scanners, et al, but also provision and install routers, switches, servers? <BR>(7) What tools/methods/capabilities can be implemented to provide web-based tracking access for customers? Is the use of web-based tracking and RFID standard in the industry? If not, would implementing these capabilities be cost prohibitive or otherwise unattainable?<BR>(8) Are there any specialized hazardous material and hazardous transportation issues that need to be addressed for this project considering the provisioning or transportation of medical equipment? Are there any specific insurance or indemnification issues that need to be addressed for this project?<BR>(9) If long-lead-time items are procured under a separate contractual vehicle, would you envision that this contractor (the holistic solution provider) will coordinate and handle the installation and transition of these items? How would this best be accomplished?<BR>(10) What type of acquisition strategy would you recommend for this type of solution? Please include contract type, pricing and incentive strategies in your response. <BR>(11) If your company has provided clinical transition services to support the outfitting of facilities, what was the extent of those services? <BR>(12) In your past experience with the transitioning of official government records/files, to include patient records and other sensitive protected information, what security measures were implemented to ensure the safeguarding of the files and how was the service executed?<BR>(13) In general, what lessons learned would you offer to the Government as they consider planning for the initial outfitting and transition of these large military medical facilities? <BR>(14) What issues and stumbling blocks has your company encountered in the past with medical facility outfitting projects that should be addressed?<BR><BR>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication the JTF CapMed or TRICARE Management Agency will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI.  This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine the scope of industry capabilities and interest.  <BR><BR>Respondents to this RFI should describe their interest and ability to perform the requirements summarized within this notice.

<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Marine Operations Division located in Norfolk, VA on a sole source basis with Pacific Maritime Institute (PMI). The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor will conduct a one (1) day Voyage Planning class and Four (4) days Bridge Resource Management Course for twelve (12) students. Classes to be held Week of FEB 23-26, 2009 at NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer in Seattle, WA. The class will be conducted using simulators which PMI has developed for NOAA. PMI has developed the 12 NOAA simulations in 3 areas of operations: Seymour Narrows, Puget Sound and Columbia River Bar to Astoria in addition to their existing library. The class is both a refresher of the basic classes we have already taken as a foundation, and an introduction to the higher level of awareness and skill we need to navigate in the situations we encounter on our ships.<br />Requirements:<br />1. A simulator with the particulars closely matching the physical characteristics of our ships: OSCAR DYSON, MILLER FREEMAN, RAINIER, FAIRWEATHER, and MCARTHUR II (TAGOs class) to start. In FY 08 the OKEANOS EXPLORER and KA'IMIMOANA and DAVID STARR JORDAN will be available during the winter in port period.</p>
<p>2. Simulations of the areas we frequent: Puget Sound to Admiralty Inlet including the Ballard Locks; Inside Passage including Wrangell and Seymour Narrows; San Francisco Harbor and approaches; and Alaska Ports including Dutch Harbor, Juneau, and Prince William Sound.</p>
<p>3. Location to facilitate minimal travel expenses for our students and a schedule to accommodate our very busy winter in Port Period and Sailing Schedule for FY 08. Cost Competitive.</p>
<p>4. Simulations that utilize our staffing situations: docking/undocking evolutions with 6 on bridge (Conn, CO, helm, engines/thruster, NAV and log); underway with 3 on bridge (lookout, OOD and JOOD); and restricted passage with 4-5 on Bridge (lookout, OOD, possibly JOOD, and CO and/or XO or NAV).</p>
<p>5. 4 simulations per day for a total of 12 over 3 days with debriefings for each (7 transit, 3 docking/undocking, and 2 close quarters)</p>
<p>6. Scenarios that stress key BRM factors including: situational awareness, organizing the bridge team, delegating task and duties, breaking error chains, improving internal and external communications, voyage planning and contingency planning and managing distractions.</p>
<p>7. Training Certificates to be provided to each student</p>
<p>The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract with a period of performance that will start from Feb 23, 2009 and will end Feb 26, 2009. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed attention to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513 or email at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov.

<DESC>The Specialty Center Acquisitions NAVFAC, Code RAQN0 intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) contract to Stateside Inc. for environmental legislative and regulatory monitoring services.  The awarded action is only for a period of 90 days.  The services are being procured on behalf of Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center (NAVFAC ESC), Port Hueneme, California, 93043. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 561499, Engineering Services.  The services that will be procured are available only from Stateside Inc.  The DOD has a need to monitor developing state level legislation and regulations, identify laws and rules that could impact DOD operations and, where appropriate, to articulate DOD needs and concerns to legislative and regulatory bodies.  Jurisdictions of interest include the fifty (50) states and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and intrastate environmental regulatory or rulemaking organizations such as local or regional air pollution control districts, and water quality management districts in states where these exist and have autonomous rulemaking authority.  This procurement is being processed in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1-Other Than Full and Open Competition.  The information is required in formats that include a Microsoft Access database, with a specific data structure.  That contractor provided database serves as a back end for Navy, Air Force, and Army front end databases reliant on the back end structure.   The front end databases serve as part of DOD Regional Environmental Coordinators business process for managing the legislative and regulatory information, and tracking actions and follow-up.  The requirement outlined in this PWS is complimentary to previous tasks completed under a prior contract, N47408-03-D-8411.  This is the second 90 SAP contract that will be issued to provide mission critical requirement to the DoD.  The first 90 day SAP contract was issued with the notion being that it would be a long enough duration to provide services while the GAO protest was being resolved on the preceeding IDIQ contract.  The protest still has not been resolved and as such a second 90 day SAP contract is necessary.  Any other Contractor wishing to perform this requirement would have to develop both the Access database, and an internal data handling system to populate the database, and it would have to populate the database with information about all the ongoing regulatory and legislative proposals currently active in the fifty states and territories that apply to the DOD.  The development of such a database and the time required to retrieve the required information to fill the database would not only be extremely time-consuming (estimate is one month minimum), but it would be prohibitively expensive because the services ordered through this GAP coverage contract are for such a brief period of time.  The Contractor selected for award of this contract will only be providing 3 months worth of services for the DOD.  Three months of service-generated revenue would not be enough for a Contractor to recoup the associated costs of the database development and required information retrieval.  As such, it would not be profitable for Contractors that do not currently have this database structure and the required information already in place to perform the work.  The engineering services being procured will reach back to the environmental issues being tracked for the DOD under the previous contract.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Inquiries regarding this posting should be directed to Aaron Glazier (805) 982-2392.

<RESPDATE>022409
<ARCHDATE>03302009
<CONTACT>Sharon Weber, Email sharon.k.weber@usps.gov
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPROSAL.  The U. S. Postal Service Eastern Facilities Service Office is seeking Qualification Statements from environmental construction contractors wishing to be pre-qualified for an Indefinite Quantity Job Order Contract (IQ JOC) for Asbestos, Lead-Based Paint, and Mold Abatement at postal facilities within the Eastern Facilities Service Office.  Contractors may select one or more geographic areas for pre-qualification.  The geographic areas are listed at the end of this advertisement.
    
PRE-QUALIFICATION:  The pre-qualification package will be made available at no cost.  The pre-qualification statements will be evaluated by qualified Postal Service employees and/or Postal Service contracted professionals.  Primary factors to be considered are company background, indefinite quantity contract experience, financial stability, capacity to perform, timely completion history, references, bonding capacity, and safety.  All contractors will be advised of their pre-qualification status within 60 days after the solicitation closes.  Contractors selected as being qualified will be placed on the IQ JOC Asbestos, Lead-Based Paint, and Mold Abatement Prequalification List for a period of five years, in the geographic area(s) covered under this solicitation only.  Upon completion of the pre-qualification process, the qualified contractors will be given an opportunity to submit multipliers and a management plan.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:  (1) Contractors must have an office located within the geographic area(s) selected for pre-qualification.  (2)  Contractors must be fully licensed for environmental construction work in the geographic area(s) selected for pre-qualification.  (3)  Contractors must have been in the environmental construction business, under the firms present name, for a minimum of five consecutive years, in the geographic area(s) selected for pre-qualification.  (4)  Contractors must provide proof of bonding with a minimum aggregate dollar amount of $2,500,000 or more.  (5)  Contractors must meet minimum computer requirements; i.e., 2.3 GHz, 1,000 megabytes RD RAM or DDRSD RAM, DVD, Windows XP Professional or equal, and high speed internet connection.

PRE-QUALIFICATION MEETING:  A pre-qualification meeting will be held on Wednesday, February 11, 2009, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, in the 2nd floor conference room at the Eastern Facilities Service Office, 7029 Albert Pick Road, Greensboro NC.  The Eastern FSO is located in the Airpark East Office Park near Hwy. 68 and I-40.  Attendance at this meeting is not mandatory but strongly suggested.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The work includes all labor, materials, equipment, and services necessary for and incidental to asbestos, lead-based paint, and mold abatement.  Typical services include, but are not limited to, the removal or repair of floor tile and mastic, damaged pipe, duct and boiler insulation, and the encapsulation of thermal and acoustical insulation.  Removal and repair are required on steam and hot water heating pipes and boilers, hot and cold water lines, heating and air conditioning ductwork, and sprayed-on ceiling insulation.  Services also include removal and repair of lead-based paint by chemical and mechanical methods.  Most of the work will be confined to basement and mechanical room areas with some work occurring in areas occupied by postal personnel.

(e)	Definitions.  The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

		(C)	EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.

(h)	Patent indemnity.  The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.  Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

	(3)	The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).  Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database.  Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.  Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
	(2)	(i)	If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

	(3)	The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).  Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database.  Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
	(4)	Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

Commercial plans are also preferred for subcontractors that provide commercial items under a prime contract, whether or not the prime contractor is supplying a commercial item. 
(h)	Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract.
(i)	The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good faith with (1) the clause of this contract entitled Utilization of Small Business Concerns, or (2) an approved plan required by this clause, shall be a material breach of the contract.

Whenever the Secretary of Labor has found, under paragraph (d) of the clause entitled Davis-Bacon Act, that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program described in section 1(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act, the Contractor shall maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in providing such benefits. Contractors employing apprentices or trainees under approved programs shall maintain written evidence of the registration of apprenticeship programs and certification of trainee programs, the registration of the apprentices and trainees, and the ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable programs.

	(2)	Each payroll submitted shall be accompanied by a Statement of Compliance, signed by the Contractor or subcontractor or his or her agent who pays or supervises the payment of the persons employed under the contract and shall certify 
		(i)	That the payroll for the payroll period contains the information required to be maintained under paragraph (a) of this clause and that such information is correct and complete; 
		(ii)	That each laborer or mechanic (including each helper, apprentice, and trainee) employed on the contract during the payroll period has been paid the full weekly wages earned, without rebate, either directly or indirectly, and that no deductions have been made either directly or indirectly from the full wages earned, other than permissible deductions as set forth in the Regulations, 29 CFR Part 3; and 
		(iii)	That each laborer or mechanic has been paid not less than the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits or cash equivalents for the classification of work performed, as specified in the applicable wage determination incorporated into the contract. 
	(3)	The weekly submission of a properly executed certification set forth on the reverse side of Optional Form WH-347 shall satisfy the requirement for submission of the Statement of Compliance required by paragraph (b)(2) of this clause. 
	(4)	The falsification of any of the certifications in this clause may subject the Contractor or subcontractor to civil or criminal prosecution under Section 1001 of Title 18 and Section 3729 of Title 31 of the United States Code. 
(c)	The Contractor or subcontractor shall make the records required under paragraph (a) of this clause available for inspection, copying, or transcription by the Contracting Officer or authorized representatives of the Contracting Officer or the Department of Labor. The Contractor or subcontractor shall permit the Contracting Officer or representatives of the Contracting Officer or the Department of Labor to interview employees during working hours on the job. If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to submit required records or to make them available, the Contracting Officer may, after written notice to the Contractor, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment. Furthermore, failure to submit the required records upon request or to make such records available may be grounds for debarment action pursuant to 29 CFR 5.12.

		Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs.  Under certain conditions, the law permits a union and an employer to enter into a union-security agreement requiring employees to pay uniform periodic dues and initiation fees.  However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment.
		If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment.  If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments.
		For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its Regional offices or at the following address or toll free number:

The number of installment payments authorized for each unit of a contract line item is equal to the number of months from the date of contract award to the date one month before the first delivery of the first separately priced unit of the contract line item.

(c)	Contractor request for installment payment.

Unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer, all installment payments in any month for which payment is being requested shall be included in a single request, appropriately itemized and totaled. 
(d)	Dates for payment. An installment payment under this clause is a contract financing payment under the Prompt Payment clause of this contract, and except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, approved requests shall be paid within 30 days of submittal of a proper request for payment. 
(e)	Liquidation of installment payments. Installment payments shall be liquidated by deducting from the delivery payment of each item the total unliquidated amount of installment payments made for that separately priced unit of that contract line item. The liquidation amounts for each unit of each line item shall be clearly delineated in each request for delivery payment submitted by the Contractor. 
(f)	Security for installment payment financing. In the event the Contractor fails to provide adequate security as required in this contract, no financing payment shall be made under this contract. Upon receipt of adequate security, financing payments shall be made, including all previous payments to which the Contractor is entitled, in accordance with the terms of the contract. If at any time the Contracting Officer determines that the security provided by the Contractor is insufficient, the Contractor shall promptly provide such additional security as the Contracting Officer determines necessary.

	(2)	The Governments rights and remedies under this clause 
		(i)	Shall not be exclusive, but rather shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or this contract; and 
		(ii)	Shall not be affected by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise preclude or impair any further exercise under this clause or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege of the Government.

(a)	Method of payment. 
	(1)	All payments by the ordering activity under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term EFT refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. 
	(2)	In the event the ordering activity is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either 
		(i)	Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or 
		(ii)	Request the ordering activity to extend payment due dates until such time as the ordering activity makes payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). 
(b)	Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information. 
	(1)	The Contractor is required to provide the ordering activity with the information required to make payment by EFT (see paragraph (j) of this clause). The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the office designated in this contract to receive that information (hereafter: designated office) by *______*.  If not otherwise specified in this contract, the payment office is the designated office for receipt of the Contractors EFT information.  If more than one designated office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the designated office(s). 
	(2)	If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the designated office. However, EFT information supplied to a designated office shall be applicable only to contracts that identify that designated office as the office to receive EFT information for that contract. 
(c)	Mechanisms for EFT payment. The ordering activity may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210. 
(d)	Suspension of payment. 
	(1)	The ordering activity is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
	(2)	If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the ordering activity shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractors request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension. 
(e)	Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 
	(1)	If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the ordering activity used the Contractors EFT information incorrectly, the ordering activity remains responsible for 
		(i)	Making a correct payment; 
		(ii)	Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and 
		(iii)	 Recovering any erroneously directed funds. 
	(2)	If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractors EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of ordering activity release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and 
		(i)	If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the ordering activity is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or 
		(ii)	If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the ordering activity shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply. 
(f)	EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
(g)	EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to the designated office, and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the ordering activity, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. 
(h)	Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The ordering activity is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractors financial agent. 
(i)	Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The ordering activity may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the ordering activity does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the ordering activity. If the ordering activity makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the ordering activity shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract. 
(j)	EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). 
The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause. 
	(1)	The contract number (or other procurement identification number). 
	(2)	The Contractors name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s). 
	(3)	The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this information. 
	(4)	The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractors financial agent. 
	(5)	The Contractors account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox).

	(7)	If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractors financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fedwire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.

(d)	Documentation. Documentation of each charge against the ordering activities account shall be provided to the Contracting Officer upon request.

(f)	Other  payment terms. The other payment terms of this contract shall govern the content and submission of payment requests. If any clause requires information or documents in or with the payment request, that is not provided in the third party agreement referenced in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall obtain instructions from the Contracting Officer before submitting such a payment request.

Because this is a requirements or indefinite quantity contract under which more than one agency may place orders, paragraph (a) of the Assignment of Claims clause (FAR 52.232-23) is inapplicable and the following is substituted therefor:
In order to prevent confusion and delay in making payment, the Contractor shall not assign any claim(s) for amounts due or to become due under this contract.  However, the Contractor is permitted to assign separately to a bank, trust company, or other financial institution, including any Federal lending agency, under the provisions of the Assignment of Claims Act, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3727, 41 U.S.C. 15 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"), all amounts due or to become due under any order amounting to $1,000 or more issued by any Government agency under this contract.

(b)	The Contractor may, within 10 working days of receipt of the notification of the proposed deductions, present to the Contracting Officer specific reasons why any or all of the proposed deductions are not justified.  Reasons must be solidly based and must provide specific facts that justify reconsideration and/or adjustment of the amount to be deducted.  Failure to respond within the 10-day period will be interpreted to mean that the Contractor accepts the deductions proposed. 
(c)	All or a portion of the final payment may be delayed or withheld until the Contracting Officer makes a final decision on the proposed deduction.  If the Contracting Officer determines that any or all of the proposed deductions are warranted, the Contracting Officer shall so notify the Contractor, and adjust payments under the contract accordingly.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
		(C)	The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

Pre-qualification designation notice means a notice in a procurement solicitation or other publication by the Government stating that the technology to be procured either affirmatively or presumptively satisfies the technical criteria necessary to be deemed a qualified anti-terrorism technology. A pre-qualification designation notice authorizes successful offeror(s) to submit streamlined SAFETY Act applications for SAFETY Act designation and receive expedited processing of those applications.
Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology (QATT) means any technology designed, developed, modified, procured, or sold for the purpose of preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism or limiting the harm such acts might otherwise cause, for which a SAFETY Act designation has been issued. For purposes of defining a QATT, technology means any product, equipment, service (including support services), device, or technology (including information technology) or any combination of the foregoing. Design services, consulting services, engineering services, software development services, software integration services, threat assessments, vulnerability studies, and other analyses relevant to homeland security may be deemed a technology.
SAFETY Act certification means a determination by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pursuant to 6 U.S.C. 442, as further delineated in 6 CFR 25.9, that a QATT for which a SAFETY Act designation has been issued is an approved product for homeland security, i.e., it will perform as intended, conforms to the seller's specifications, and is safe for use as intended. "Block certification" refers to a technology class that DHS has determined to be an approved class of approved products for homeland security.
SAFETY Act designation means a determination by DHS pursuant to 6 U.S.C. 443, as further delineated in 6 CFR 25.4, that a particular Anti-Terrorism Technology constitutes a QATT under the SAFETY Act. "Block designation" refers to a technology class that DHS has determined to be a QATT.

It also confers other important benefits. SAFETY Act designation and SAFETY Act certification are designed to support effective technologies aimed at preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism, or limiting the harm that such acts might otherwise cause, and which also meet other prescribed criteria.
(c)	(1)	DHS has issued a SAFETY Act pre-qualification designation notice for the technology to be acquired under this solicitation.
	(2)	This notice is attached to this solicitation and contains essential information, including--
		(i)	A detailed description of and specification for the technology covered by the notice;
		(ii)	A statement that the technology described and specified in the notice satisfies the technical criteria to be deemed a QATT and the offeror's proposed technology either may presumptively or will qualify for the issuance of a designation provided the offeror complies with terms and conditions in the notice and its application is approved;
		(iii)	The period of time within which DHS will take action upon submission of a SAFETY Act application submitted pursuant to the notice;
		(iv)	A listing of those portions of the application that must be completed and submitted by selected awardees and the time periods for such submissions;

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection 
(b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
	(i) warrants;
	(ii) options;
	(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
	(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
	(v) others similar interests.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>NOTE:  Amendment #2 changes the page count from 10 pages to 20 pages.

This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the 55th Contracting Squadron to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing systems engineering and technical services with emphasis on precise Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) technologies and operational support to the Joint Navigational Warfare Center (JNWC).  JNWC is the Department of Defenses focal point for Navwar.   JNWC will operate as a coordinating organization between organizations responsible for operating Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Systems, maximizing the protection of the systems for the warfighter, preventing the use of systems by the enemy, and integrating capability with U.S. Government agencies (e.g. Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation) and coalition/allied partners.  
The mission of the Joint Navigational Warfare Center is to provide operational-level joint warfighter support through planning, integrating and coordinating navigational warfare (Navwar) policy and activities within and across geographic Areas of Responsibility (AOR), functional communities and DoD organizations in coordination with HQ STRATCOM.  The JNWC provides Navwar support to the combatant commanders Navwar operational planning and execution responsibilities, current and timely Navwar information to the warfighter, and participates in Service and joint training and exercise events globally.  Functions include independent Navwar testing, demonstrations, experiments, and assessments.  The JNWC develops, maintains and disseminates standards for Navwar analytical tools and methods, and develops and maintains Navwar modeling and simulation expertise for the DoD.  The JNWC has been designated as the sole repository of Navwar research, development, experimentation and development, and will function as an Information Analysis Center (IAC) to consolidate research, scientific and technical analysis on Navwar topics.  The requirement for this expertise is most notable in the engineering and analysis support provided, where the contractor will assess the performances of military weapon systems in Navwar environment, and then generate reports and studies that may provide advice both on the use of the weapon system, and on future engineering upgrades of the system.   The JNWC customer base includes joint and coalition warfighter, mission planners, tactics developers, system developers and testers.  
HOW TO SUBMIT:  Respondents capable of performing this effort are requested to submit capability packages electronically via e-mail to cynthia.waller@offutt.af.mil.

Offutt AFB has firewalls that prohibit certain attachments.  When sending documents, please indicate the type of the document in the message of the e-mail and rename that attachment by changing the last character of the extension to an underscore.  Example:  capabilities.wpd should be renamed to capabilities.wp_.  All packages should be UNCLASSIFIED material only.  A verification e-mail will be sent upon receipt (as a reply to your e-mail).  If you do not receive verification, contact Ms. Cynthia Waller at (402) 232-8661 for further instructions.

When identifying the business size standard (if a small business) indicate whether the respondent is an 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business.  Respondents should also identify (if applicable) classification as a historically black college or university (HBCU), or minority institution as defined by the clause at DFARS 252.226-7000.  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541330; Small business size standard is $27M.

CAPABILITY PACKAGE AND EVALUATION:  The Government will identify competitive firms by evaluating the capability packages by using the evaluation criteria (80 questions) below.  Each criteria will be rated as pass or fail.  A majority of the criteria must be rated as passing for an offeror capability package to be deemed as competitive.

<DESC><p>Note: An attachment including the details of industry day will be available on 12 Jun 06. The 554 Electronic Systems Wing is pleased to announce an Industry Day Conference for the follow-on Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) contract on 19 Jun 06 at Hanscom AFB MA. GCSS-AF is an Electronic Systems Center initiative to meet total systems integration and operations for Operations Support net-centric infrastructure, although over time that infrastructure will blend or merge with C2ISR infrastructure. The GCSS-AF infrastructure will also support some Joint or other military service operations and over time enterprise services may be eliminated or merged or adopted from other military services or the DoD. Target focus is the continued operations of GCSS-AF infrastructure on the NIPRNET and SIPRNET, evolution of GCSS-AF's Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and continued high velocity delivery of infrastructure, data services, and fused, cross-functional war-fighter capabilities. Work will be accomplished as required at Hanscom AFB, MA; contractor facilities; DoD locations and facilities throughout the Continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii and various facilities overseas. Temporary and extended overseas travel (more than thirty days) may be required.</p>

<SUBJECT>Implementation Support Services for FEMA Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS)
<SOLNBR>IPAWSISS1208
<RESPDATE>022009
<CONTACT>Sandra K. Bucher, Contracting Officer, Phone (540) 542-2303, Fax (540) 542-2632, Email sandra.bucher@dhs.gov
<DESC>1.0	Purpose:  The Federal Emergency Management Agency is seeking information that will help the Agency define its future contracting approach for providing implementation support services for the Integrated Public Alert and Warning Program (IPAWS).   This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.   This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.   Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission, other than acknowledgement of receipt if requested by the submitter.

2.0     Background: Executive Order (E.O.) 13407, Public Alert and Warning System, dated June 26, 2006, directed the Secretary of Homeland Security, to ensure that under all conditions the President of the United States can alert and warn the American people. FEMA is implementing projects to modernize and integrate the existing Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Alert and Warning System (NAWAS) programs to provide a national-level all-hazards warning system. Collectively these systems will constitute the Integrated Public Alert and Warning (IPAWS) Program.  IPAWS will utilize current national-level warning systems, support state, territory, tribal, and local warning needs, and integrate new technologies, standards, partnerships, and policies to improve public warning over all media, to all people, at all times, in all situations. Planned projects to be implemented over the next five years include investments in communications infrastructure across the United States. Efforts to support these activities may require collection and analysis of information on legacy alert and warning systems, engineering and specialized technical services, acquisition of hardware and software, site design and construction, installation, testing, integration, delivery and operations and maintenance support. FEMA will use the information received through this RFI to help define the appropriate contractual mechanism for acquisition of IPAWS implementation services.
3.0   Information Requested:  The following questions are intended to help structure a potential acquisition to provide a flexible, cost effective solution to IPAWS implementation. 
1.	FEMA is contemplating award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for these services.  A draft IPAWS Implementation Support Services Statement of Work (SOW) is provided as an attachment to the RFI for this proposed requirement.  Please submit your comments and recommendations to the proposed SOW.   
2.	A service type contract is anticipated and FEMA is interested in adapting a performance based scope for the contract.  What considerations are important when considering performance based contracts for this type of support services? Do you have any recommendations for specific performance incentives that have achieved the desired results on current or previous commercial or government contracts?  What specific progress reporting (such as ANSI 748) would you recommend?
3.	How should the purchase of any required hardware and software be accomplished (e.g., time and material type approach?)?
4.	What are some lessons learned FEMA should consider from other similar contracts with commercial or Government customers youve supported?   What features limited the effectiveness of these contracts? 
4.0     FEMA is also interested in assessing level of interest within the industry for this future support services acquisition.  Interested firms are invited to submit a statement of capability addressing their interest in serving as either a prime or subcontractor for this potential procurement. Therefore, in your response please provide the following information.

4.1	 Demonstrated experience in the following areas:
1.	Design, deployment, integration, test and delivery of emergency alert and warning or similar type systems.
2.	Design and construction of facilities to support operation of alert and warning or similar type systems. 
3.	Operational support of alert and warning or similar systems.
4.	Ability to carry out the services outlined in 1-3 above in a classified environment.
4.2	Certain aspects of the IPAWS are classified.  How is your company positioned to support classified work under this potential procurement, specifically, available personnel with U.S Secret or U.S Top Secret Clearances and an approved Facilities Security Clearance with a level up to Top Secret? Do you have staff to support this effort with appropriate clearances for access to White House facilities?
4.3 	Please provide information on your companys size and capacity including total annual revenues and number of direct employees.
5.0     All small businesses including Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, Women-Owned and Service Disabled are strongly encouraged to provide timely responses to this RFI. A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist FEMA in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to provide the required services.     In addition, this information will also be used to assist FEMA in establishing a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract/small business participation plan small business goal percentages.

(1) _____ Are, _____ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) _____ Have, _____ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) _____ Are, _____ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) _____ Have, _____ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<DESC>This amendment is posted to respond to questions received for the Fire and Emergency Services RFI.
Question 1.  What is the time for submission?
Answer 1.  Close of Business on Friday, January 23, 2009.
Question 2.  Do contractors have access to the USMC website as indicated in the RFI?
Answer 2.  The HQMC (C4) site has been changed to require CAC log on.Thus, none of the companies will be able to access the site to review thedocumentation we were pointing them towards.  We will have to provide therequired documentation as part of the RFP process.  
Question 3.  Is there a parallel civilian criteria that needs to be met for system requirements regarding the certifications and accreditations?  
Answer 3.  The USMC F&ES Program is unaware of parallel civilian criteria.  For the purposes of this RFI, a response indicating that your company will meet the DoD/DIACAP requirements will suffice.
Question 4.  Will we be able to receive further details or speak with an IT person who understands technical requirements for the RM piece?
Answer 4.  (1) The United States Marine Corps (USMC) Fire Protection and Emergency Services program records management requirements are derived from the requirements of the following policy documents, which should be available in the public domain (a simple internet search should retrieve the documents):
?	Department of Defense Instructions (DoDI) 6055.06 dated 21 December 2006 "DoD Fire and Emergency Services Program".?	Marine Corps Order (MCO) P11000.11B dated 9 January 1997 "Fire Protection and Emergency Services".
A full list of the technical requirements for records management functionality has not been prepared by the USMC F&ES program office yet, but will be developed during the later stages of this procurement process.  Generally speaking, the program is attempting to meet the basic records management requirements of any fire and emergency services department, including but not limited to: personnel training records, fire apparatus fleet inventory and other vehicle information, equipment inventory, budget data, etc.
(2) Department of Defense, Department of Navy (DoN), and the United States Marine Corps publish policy regarding Records Management, which address requirements such as:  how long records must be maintained, information assurance for records, privacy act data collection requirements, etc.  The future Request for Proposals (RFP) associated with this effort will include a listing of applicable Records Management policy documents.  The below list is provided as sample of policy documents that could potentially affect the E-RMRS system procurement.  These policy documents should be available via the source websites (DoD, DoN, USMC, etc.):
?	DoD 5200.1R Information Security Program?	DoD Memo - DoD Privacy Impact Assessment Guidance?	DoD CIO Memo Dtd 18 Aug 2006 "DoD Guidance on Protecting PII"?	SECNAVINST 5211.5E - DON Privacy Program?	MARADMIN 348/06 - Use of Data Protected By The Privacy Act ?	SECNAV Instruction M-5210.1, November 16, 2007, Department of the Navy Records Management manual
