<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer (RFO) for the Addition to Building 1100 on Stennis Space Center Mississippi. The work for this requirement consists of, but is not limited to the following: Provide all labor, equipment, tools and materials to construct a three-story office building addition of approximately 19,500 square feet.	The foundation will consist of auger cast grout piles, concrete grade beams, and slab.  The structure will be steel columns and beams and bar joist.  The exterior will be made of pre-cast concrete panels and blue tinted insulated windows.	The interior work will consist of metal stud partitions with gypsum board, suspended ceilings, and carpet and vinyl flooring.  Supporting systems for the addition will consist of electrical power, lighting, extension of the fire alarm system, fire sprinkler system, heating and air conditioning via chilled water, and hot water.  The roofing will be a modified asphalt membrane.  All work will be performed at the John C. Stennis Space Center located in Hancock County, MS.	 Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government.  BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts).  However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so. The order of magnitude for this procurement is $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, and the effort shall be completed within (365) calendar days after receipt of the notice to proceed.  This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.	As a result, all qualified responsible sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 236210 and $28.5 million, respectively.	The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about February 28, 2003, with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about April 1, 2003. The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.   An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM. Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office: anita.demarco-1@nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet. These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or	URL, for the NASA/SSC Business Opportunities page is http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=64  Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

(b) Quality Monitoring & Control has substantial experience in creating the specific diagnostics software and technologies to adapt our existing codes to work in the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) Engineering Environment.  The Government will maximize investment dollars by taking advantage of Quality Monitoring & Control existing development and expertise.	(c) Quality Monitoring & Control software is currently under license at NASA/MSFC for use in physics and numeric modeling as well as in sensor and equipment fault detection with diagnostics.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on February 24, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>Synopsis for Architect-Engineering (A-E) Services for Design of the Repair or Replacement of the 350 Psig Steam Distribution System in Utility Tunnel No.4.(THIS IS NOT AN RFP) Work includes engineering services for site investigation and preparation of the design, with contract drawings, specifications, and a construction cost estimate for repair or replacement of the 350 Psig Steam Distribution System in Utility Tunnel No.4 at Langley Research Center. The existing 350-psig system was installed in the mid 1960's and was originally designed for a one-direction steam flow of 35,000 pounds per hour from Building 1215 (Langley Steam Plant).  In the mid 1980's, an additional supply source from Building 1288 (Recoup) was added in the middle of the distribution system and depending on which source supplies steam, the system can now have bi-directional steam flow of around 60,000 pounds per hour. The existing steam piping is made up of 8" welded carbon steel pipe with 29 expansion joints and 55 traps.  Included in the system are several pressure reducing stations that reduce the pressure from 350 to125 psig.  This requires two separate condensate return legs, One 60 psig and the other 30 psig.  The major portion of the existing steam distribution system is contained in an underground concrete tunnel with a small portion in a shallow trench and a small portion above ground. This distribution tunnel supplies: (1) Steam and utilities to 13 main center facilities, (2) steam for all the Center's institutional heating and cooling needs during non-peak hours (from the supply source added in the 1980's).  The above ground portion supplies institutional and research steam to 27 test area facilities,The repaired or replacement system needs to be designed for a 75,000 pounds per hour steam flow in either direction. Automated controls and equipment need to be provided to allow either supply source to operate independently or in conjunction as needed.  Estimated cost of the construction project is between $5-10M. Firms, which can meet the requirements described, are invited to submit SF 254 and 255 no later than February 21,2003. The final design is required to be completed by mid June 2004. It is contemplated that a firm fixed price A-E type of contract will be awarded. Firms responding to this synopsis should include the Reference No.AE-4T on their submitted SF 254 and SF255 and their letter of transmittal. The following is a list of Selection Criteria the NASA Architect-Engineering Selection Board will apply (in the order of importance): 1.  Professional Qualifications:  Submit a matrix for proposed design team that contains the following data about the member's assignment: Team member's name, firm name (if subcontractor), office location, proposed team assignment, highest education level/discipline (example: BS, mechanical engineering), states of professional registration, number of years of professional experience, number of years with the firm. For project manager, identify the number of projects managed over the past 5 years. 2.    Specialized Experience:  Provide a description of recent germane steam system projects, with clients, which your firm designed. Work on these projects must have been done in the last 5 years.

These ratings shall be dated 1998 or later and include the following data: client's contact, client's need date, design completion date, and final cost estimate compared to the construction contract award amount (note whether sealed bid or negotiated). 4.	  Location and capacity of the firm to timely accomplish the work:  Demonstrate the ability to complete several multidisciplinary contract orders concurrently (i.e., the impact of this potential workload on the firm's permanent staff, anticipated workload during the contract period, and the firm's history of successfully completed work in compliance with performance schedules). Indicate the firm's present workload and the availability of the proposed team members (including sub consultants) for the specified contract period. Since numerous site visits may be required, provide the location of the office primarily responsible for this work. 5. Quality Control:  A-E firms selected for interviews must submit their Design Quality Assurance Plan (DQAP) at the time of the interview, including an explanation of the management approach, an organizational chart showing inter-relationship of management and design team components, specific quality control processes, a portfolio of design work (both new construction and upgrades to existing facilities), a listing of present business commitments and their required completion schedules, financial and credit references, and performance references. Firms who are ISO 9001 certified only need to provide a copy of their ISO Certification.

The CIAO, under Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63), has the responsibility for coordinating a national awareness and outreach program on critical infrastructure protection, particularly information security, to the private sector.

The purpose of this requirement is to provide the Department of Homeland Security a series of articles on proven leadership practices and tools that could be used by state and local officials to include suggested models of behaviors.  In this regard, the CIAO requires specialized Contractor support in defining, gathering, recording and analyzing data in order to develop the articles.  Accordingly, the CIAO requires assistance from an entity acknowledged in the community as having expertise and a high level of competency to develop a series of articles and other materials on the topic of "Leadership in Turbulent Times".

The tasks include establishing interviews with representatives of target audiences for content input, the development of a mutually agreed upon methodology and reporting format (drawing on existing and established methodologies); interviews from selected industry experts; and the drafting and publishing of the articles.
 
Offerors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response with a demonstrating their expertise and a level of competency in the field.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.

<DESC>Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) has been tasked to lead a test team for testing Navy shipboard sonar-based Swimmer Detection Systems (SDS). Test Location is the Navy ATFP Test Bed located at Naval Air Station, North Island, San Diego, CA. The testing is planned to be conducted in sequential one-week periods (with a one-week break between tests to document and analyze results). To accomplish this, it is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued on or about 28 Feb 2003. The solicitation will include a Statement of Work, Test Performance Criteria, Contract Data Requirements List, DD254, Source Selection Criteria and a test syllabus. The successful offerors must possess a Secret (or higher) Security Clearance. It is anticipated that required test platform information for deployment consideration will be included in the solicitation. A site visit to the testing platform prior to the solicitation’s closing date is currently being considered by the Navy. Source Selection will be divided into two phases. Phase I is selection of applicants that meet the requirements listed below to train Navy personnel and support the actual testing of their SDS. The Government will provide $18,000 for each of these Phase I awards utilizing Cost As and Independent Variable (CAIV). The SDS must be provided at no cost to the Government via a Bailment Agreement. Source selection for Phase I will be based on technical/performance capability and past performance. Technical/performance capability will be based on, but not limited to, the following criteria: The systems must: be Commercial Items (See FAR 2.101 definition); be available for the test window (anticipated date: mid-April through mid-June); provide Automatic detection, classification, and tra cking; demonstrate user-friendly operation display (e.g. no raw data); and exhibit capability for ship deployment from a large deck. Each of the criteria listed above will be further defined in the solicitation. It is anticipated that awards will be made by 4 April 2003 in order for testing to begin 14 April 2003. Phase II will be the award of one IDIQ contract for production systems (a “down-select”) based on the test results and proposed SDS prices. All inquires, comments, concerns and questions must be directed to Mary Ann Wathen through email wathen_m@crane.navy.mil. Failure to follow proper procedures could render a prospective offeror ineligible for consideration. To verify receipt of email, contact Mary Ann Wathen at 812-854-5090.

The overall objective of the LTRC is to enable better management of lung diseases by increasing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases through molecular histopathological studies of human lung tissues with and without disease.  The LTRC will facilitate histopathological research of pulmonary diseases by collecting lung tissues from donors and preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens to researchers within and outside the Consortium. Primary emphases will be on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Collections of specimens will be linked to extensive, individual clinical data appropriate to the particular disease.  Donor subjects will be recruited for specific enrollment groups that are designed to address important research questions.  The consortium will be comprised of CCs; a Tissue Processing and Distribution Center (TC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-09; a Radiology Center (RC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-10; and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-11.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to read the RFPs for all of these components of the LTRC to better understand the overall structure and function of the Consortium.  CCs, will recruit and enroll specimen donors; perform clinical testing of subjects; extract data from the patients? medical records; obtain lung tissues and other specimens and perform initial processing of these specimens and transmit clinical data, computed tomographic (CT) image data, and biological specimens to appropriate centers of the LTRC.  CCs will provide reports of any radiographic or pathological abnormalities noted by the RC and/or TC to the donor subjects? primary care physicians.  In addition, each CC will perform hypothesis-oriented, tissue-based research, using LTRC specimens, that addresses pathogenetic mechanisms of COPD and/or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and work with other LTRC investigators to prepare reports and manuscripts for publication. ******This is not a RFP and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this notice.  It is anticipated that  RFP-NHLBI-HR-04-08, Lung Tissue Research Consortium: Clinical Centers, will be available on or fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice through the NHLBI Website at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and posted on FedBizOpps at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>DESC:  The Material Systems Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH intends to negotiate a contract for the purchase of two copies of Informatica PowerCenter Class II for NT production licenses with one (1) year of maintenance and the option to purchase two additional one year of maintenance for each copy.  These licenses will be used to support the extraction, transformation and loading of the legacy data from Air Force (AF) systems (and other legacy/modernization systems in the future) into Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW).  This requirement must be compatible with current operation systems.  It has been identified that the Informatica software is the only brand that will uniquely satisfy all of the key requirements for the EDW.  Use of another brand would adversely impact the ability to analyze data in the EDW. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(c), the Government is negotiating directly with the developer, Informatica Corporation.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide the capability within twelve (12) calendar days of this publication.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Enzymes are useful for bio-processing at a nanoscale.  However, a serious drawback to their use is that when exposed in a solution, they have very short lifetimes.  Present ways of ameliorating this problem involve immobilizing the protein on a solid support or entrapping them in a support matrix.  To a degree, these methods are successful; however, for many reasons, they do not completely solve the problem and in fact, may cause the enzyme to become inactivated during the immobilization process.  In addressing this problem, researchers at DOE?s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed armored, single-enzyme nanoparticles which dramatically stabilize a protein by surrounding each enzyme with a porous composite organic/inorganic shell of less than a few nanometers thick.  While such armored enzymes show some decrease in efficiency, they are stable for long periods of time and have the same binding constant as free enzyme.  Experimental data suggest the armored shell is porous enough not to interfere with the proteolysis of proteins up to a molecular weight of 66K.  These armored single-enzyme nanoparticles remain soluble in aqueous solutions and can be immobilized onto solid supports or matrices for applications that require that form.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 90 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

The NLSC is an entirely reimbursable cost center. It is funded through Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) or Intra-Agency Agreements with its Customer organizations. Currently, NLSC has six Customers; four are NOAA entities: National Weather Service (NWS), NOAA Finance and Administration (NFA), the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and the National Ocean Service (NOS).

Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Earth (GLOBE) Program under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The release of this draft PWS is the first step to meet the requirements. Prior to DOC/NOAA undertaking the full acquisition process, we intend to determine if our needs can be met as presented below. Firms who believe they can meet our needs are requested to respond to this Request for Comments (RFC). Comments should address the PWS and each functional area. Your response to the PWS should coincide with the numbering identifiable to the paragraph numbering contained below.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole-source basis pursuant authority of 41 USC 253 (c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (b)(2) with ECRI, Plymouth Meeting, PA, a non profit organization, for a nine-month extension of contract N01-LM-9-3507 through December 31, 2003.  An extension is necessary to reduce the backlog of indexed records that accrued while government furnished software (NLM?s new Data Citation Creation and Maintenance System (DCMS)) was placed into service and subsequent system refinements were developed, tested, and implemented.  ECRI has created and maintains the proprietary nomenclature (Universal Medical Device Nomenclsture System (UMDNS) and produces proprietary publications and databases related to health services research.  The nomenclature, databases and publications are not available from any other source.  ECRI also has the requisite expertise to make selections of items for indexing from their own information products and services.  The no-cost extension will permit ECRI time to complete the following data and services: 1) Machine-readable records for health services research and health care technology assessment reports and literature collected, abstracted and indexed by ECRI in its role as a World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Information Transfer on Medical Devices and as publisher of the Healthcare Standards Directory. 2) Expert review of the results of automated mapping between ECRI?s proprietary Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System (UMDNS) and NLM?s own vocabulary products as well as expert mapping of ECRI?s UMDNS with related medical vocabularies available through NLM?s Unified Medical Language System?. No other source can provide ECRI?s proprietary data and services which are required under this contract.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals nor is an RFP available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The scope of this effort is focused on creating a communications plan to be used for the product launch of the Lawson HCM system.  The plan will establish the communications goals, channels, key messages, and other supporting means for reaching the House's diversified stakeholders.  
It is necessary that the plan identify specific initiatives to support HR PayLinks communications needs, and present an implementation plan with reasonable measures for effectiveness.  Implementation of the communications plan will focus on those activities that have highest potential to produce the desired results.
The plan must be cognizant of the dynamics of organizational change related to such implementations, including points of resistance, and incorporate ideas both from, and for, a broad range of House employees.  The total House population is approximately 10,000.  Many primarily work at the House campus in Washington, DC; however, a number of the House employees are assigned to and work in district offices in the states which their House Member of Congress represents.  
Those with a stake in the success of HR PayLinks range from the Committee on House Administration (CHA), the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), and senior Human Resources (HR) management to those involved in the project development and the actual members of the House workforce.
The plan will establish strategic communications goals and the messages to support them.  The plan will identify various stakeholder audiences and describe the most effective means to reach them.   Specifically, the communications plan shall pinpoint and describe the approach envisioned to most effective reach the end-users, power-users, managers, and other stakeholders - and create an awareness and understanding of the need for change.  It is essential the communication plan stimulates interest among these stakeholders that will lead to their involvement, inspire constructive discussion, and result in their input concerning the project.
CAO accepts that change is hard, and inevitably generates resistance.  Consequently, the HR PayLinks communications plan will be a critical element in the change management process used to create effective change within the House.  The communications plan will be instrumental in setting priorities for handling the information needs of the stakeholder groups and ensuring that House members and staff have a common vision of the change and become a part of the change process.

<DESC>The following changes have been made to the combined synopsis/solicitation:  (1)  The expected tow date will be the last week of March 2003 and (2)  NO NDBC or SAIC will be on board for the tow.  They will prep the buoy for towing and meet at MARAD.  
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is NWWG953039999 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC2001-11).  The contract will be a firm-fixed price per day charge purchase order.  Quoted estimates are to be itemized on a per day basis and shall identify estimated transit times, boat rental fees (if applicable), and all other charges necessary to complete the trip.
NDBC is discontinuing a 10-meter buoy station and intends to place the 10-meter buoy in storage.  NDBC is seeking to contract a vessel to tow NDBC buoy 10D06 from the DB Sampson mooring in Santa Barbara, CA to the MARAD storage facility in Suisun Bay, CA.  The buoy to be towed is 10m (33ft) in diameter with a hull depth of 1.98m (6.5ft).  The buoy displaces 62,300 kg (115,00lbs), of which approximately 48 percent is water ballast. The buoy is constructed of low carbon steel, with an aluminum sensor level of 10 m (32.8 ft) above the deck.  The buoy draft is 3.2 feet.  The buoy is expected to be ready for towing on or around the last week of March 2003.
Prior to towing the buoy, NDBC/SAIC contractor personnel will ballast the buoy for deployment.  This is done by transferring the ballast until 38" is from the freeboard to the deck edge.  NDBC personnel will verify the operation of the O&I light, and securing all doors, hatches, scuttles, and tank covers.
A single point tow from the reinforced deck pad eye at the designated bow is recommended.  Note: the only fitting on the buoy capable of sustaining the towing loads are the heavy outboard pad eyes.  To rig a towing bridle from these pad eyes is not recommended, as the resulting bridle angle is too great to be effective.  NDBC discus buoys have been towed at speeds from 6 to 10 knots, with towing hawser lengths of 400 to 1,800 feet.  Depending on weather and sea conditions, the best speeds are attained on longer hawsers.  In adverse weather conditions, speeds must be reduced to keep the buoy deck from becoming awash.
The vessel is responsible for supplying all towing equipment.  In addition the Captain, crew and vessel must be Coast Guard licensed.  Proof of vessel insurance must be provided prior to awarding contract.  There are maximum sea states in which the vessel would be expected to operate.  The decision whether to go or no-go when considering weather conditions will be made by mutual agreement between the NDBC representative and the boat Captain, with the Captain having the final authority to postpone, cancel, or delay a mission.  Due consideration will be given to the safety of the vessel and personnel aboard at all times.  A no-go decision because of weather will not be considered a cancellation of the contract.

<DESC>This is a combined sources sought notice/pre-solicitation notice.  The USDA/ARS intends to award a contract to Li-Cor, Inc. 4308 Progressive Avenue, Lincoln NE 68504 for a used Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, Global IR2 System Upgrade Kit, Saga MX Personal Edition Software and Model 4200 Support Contract on a sole-source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), if no other responsive, responsible sources are found.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The Government intends to use Commercial Item procedures, FAR Part 12.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a compeetitive basis.  A Government-owned ABI 3100 DNA Sequencer is being used at the Genotyping Center for SSR analysis.  Equipment is needed for AFLP analysis for automatic scoring of AFLP, and convert an AFLP developed in ABI 3100 into a simple breeder-friendly PCR-based marker.  Conversion of AFLPs into STSs is a major task of the Genotyping Center.  Li-Cor's AFLP Deluxe System including the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System makes it possible to routinely do AFLP analysis to transfer AFLPs into STSs markers and to directly use PCR-based markers for marker-assisted selection.  Li-Cor is the sole supplier of the Odyssey Infrared Imaging instrumentation and service.  The Odyssey software associated with this instrument is unique to the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and there are current patents in regard to the nature of the IR detection systems.  The software is nontransferable unless agreed upon by Li-Cor.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. Mountain Time on  February 14, 2003.

<SUBJECT>JTRS-M Industry day #3 Notice
<DESC>Commerce Business Daily Notice of Advisory Multi-Step Process and Industry Day for Joint Tactical Radio System - Maritime/Fixed Site (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3 POC:  Mark Lopez, SPAWAR 02-32, Contracting Officer, (e-mail address: mark.lopez@navy.mil or lopezm@spawar.navy.mil); commercial telephone (619) 524-7168. DESCRIPTION:   The objective of the Joint Tactical Radio System-Maritime/Fixed Site (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3 program is to develop a Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) specifically for maritime and fixed site communication requirements. The purpose of the development effort is to create the next generation Maritime and Fixed Site Communication system which shall provide growth capabilities through an open system architecture that enables technology insertion through evolutionary acquisition or preplanned product improvements (P3I). JTRS-M/F shall be a multi-mode, multi-band, software definable radio system. This will result in increased operational flexibility, enhanced interoperability and reduced life cycle cost. JTRS-M/F will be capable of transmitting voice, video, and data while operating in frequency bands from 2 MHz to 2000 MHz. In order to facilitate an orderly and cost-effective migration from legacy systems, the new JTRS-M/F shall maintain backward compatibility with selected legacy systems and provide a seamless technological transition path to support the next generation radio room. The JTRS-M/F will be defined as a complete end-to-end communications system with a combination of hardware elements, supporting software infrastructure, and government furnished waveform applications. This system will include all RF distribution and control equipment to support voice, video, and data communications. The JTRS Program is a series of related but independent joint acquisitions. The Army is the Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) for the joint activities executed by the JTRS Joint Program Office (JPO).  The JPO is responsible for defining, developing, validating, and maintaining the Software Communication Architecture (SCA) and acquiring software waveform applications. The JTRS-M/F (Cluster 3) Program Manager (Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, PMW 179) is responsible for developing JTRS-M/F hardware (with a SCA-compliant operating environment) and porting waveforms obtained from the JTRS JPO waveform repository to field the JTRS-M/F as a final consolidated product in support of the Fleet and other service fixed sites. The key goals of the system are to ensure maximum scalability, modularity, and extensibility across all ship classes and fixed site platforms. The anticipated release date for the official JTRS-M/F Cluster 3Request for Proposal (RFP) is in the summer 2003 timeframe with contract award anticipated 1th Qtr calendar year 2004.  It is estimated that the successful offerors will have approximately thirty (30) months from contract award to provide Engineering Developmental Models (EDM) for testing. This CBD announcement is to invite Prime System Level potential offerors to submit information that allows the government to evaluate and advise the respondents about their potential to be viable competitors IAW FAR 15.202 (i.e. Advisory Multi-Step Process).  The government will not evaluate submitted information if it only concerns a part of the JTRS-M/F System, e.g. only the radio.  Submittals must address the entire JTRS/MF System as detailed in the attached specification.  Offerors shall present their submission to the government team at a Cluster 3 Industry Day 11-13 March 2003 to be held in San Diego at the Booz, Allen, and Hamilton offices located at:1615 Murray Canyon Rd Suite 220 San Diego, California 92108 Phone - (619) 725-6500 Advisory Multi-Step Process (FAR 15.202):  Prime System Level potential offerors are invited to provide to the government a forty  (40) page limit (total) electronic response to this part of the CBD announcement in the following categories: 1) Current JTRS-M/F related products relevant to this solicitation - Provide information on the availability of your current related products and the extent of any modifications required to meet the requirements as outlined in the draft specification relevant to the forthcoming solicitation.  Include your proposed system architecture with detailed block diagrams. 2) Baseline Requirements - Demonstrate your ability via a technical approach or documented past experience to provide the Cluster 3 capabilities (identified in the Specification attached) using either non-developmental or developmental products and discuss the risk to accomplish the baseline requirements and how these risks will be overcome.  Discuss what technical or cost tradeoffs can be made to meet baseline requirements. 3) Legacy equipment - Provide information on how the proposed capabilities will meet or exceed existing legacy equipment including a simplified plan on how the vendor would verify this requirement. 4) Baseband Interface Connectivity - Provide a technical analysis using either current or developed technology demonstrating an ability to interface with current and future Baseband equipment  - address the technical and operational viability of implementing the conceptual Legacy Interface Unit (LIU). 5) RF Interfaces - Address approach to satisfy the automated RF switching requirement (i.e. JTRS-M/F Cluster 3 Objective - Any Radio RF channel to applicable RF Distribution System components).  Proposed design shall include block diagrams and affordability of proposed solution.  Discuss what technical or cost tradeoffs can or must be made to satisfy this objective. Additional information desired (and not subject to page limit) by the government for informational purposes is: 6) Cluster 3 Schedule - Provide an executive type schedule that portrays the efforts planned in order to deliver the Cluster 3.  Identify the level of schedule risk associated with this schedule. 7) ROM cost of Delivered baseline Cluster 3 system - Provide an estimated production price of a Cluster 3 system for DDG-51 class ship with a breakdown of the major equipment/cost areas. 8) Specification Clarification- Address the major clarifications and/or deficiencies associated with the High Level System Specification and associated appendices / annexes. 9)  Additional Information required - Provide detailed non-proprietary questions addressing additional information required of the Government. 10) Address the portability issues and constraints associated with integrating JPO waveforms into the Cluster 3 System.  What are the technical challenges associated with using dissimilar hardware and software architectures with varying hardware and software partitioning? What technical, cost and schedule tradeoffs can or should be made? Responses will be evaluated against the criteria questions 1-5 above. COST/ROM data will be excluded from the evaluation.  Each criteria (questions 1-5 above) is of equal importance. Questions 6-10 are for informational purposes only Responses who demonstrate technically viable solutions against the above grading criteria will receive letters stating that they are considered viable contenders in the forthcoming competition.  Responses who have not demonstrated technically viable solutions will be so advised with rationale on why their response is considered not viable.  Partial system component solutions will not be evaluated.  This evaluation notwithstanding the potential offeror is not precluded from participating in the resultant acquisition.  Nothing submitted in response to this synopsis will be used for evaluation purposes once the final RFP is released.  Responses to the Multi-Step Advisory must be received by 1600 EST on 28 February 2003 in writing and delivered to the following address: Commander, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, 4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127, Attn: Mark Lopez, Code 02-33.  Each Prime System Level offeror should contact Mark Lopez to schedule a one and a half hour block of time to present their submission to the government team between the morning of 11 March to the close of business of 13 March.  This should be accomplished NLT Feb 28th.  Companies with partial system solutions should not request a block of time to present their components or technology.  The afternoon of 10 March will be a general audience brief to include opening remarks by the JTRS-M/F Program Manager, and a JTRS-M/F Program Status Briefing by the Acquisition Program Manager, at which time the government will entertain any additional questions. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, all Prime System Level responsible parties that can provide data to demonstrate that they may successfully propose/bid to produce the JTRS-M/F system in a full and open competition as called out in the Specification are encouraged to attend and actively participate in this Industry Day.

USAID/CAR, Regional Mission for Central Asia intends to purchase the services of a contractor to conduct polls as described in the Statement of Work below.  

SCOPE OF WORK.  

BACKGROUND: Many factors threaten peace and stability in communities throughout the five new nations of Central Asia.  Economic decline is highly correlated with the emergence of civil conflict; yet, the root causes of potential conflict are dynamic in nature, rather than a result of poverty or ethnic differences alone.  Central Asia continues to face historically unprecedented declines in family incomes and employment rates, and deteriorating health and educational conditions at all levels - overall a precipitous loss of socioeconomic security for all but the new elite.  When this precipitous deterioration of living conditions is coupled with an inability to express frustration through peaceful political channels, citizens' alienation and grievances grow and may reach sufficient critical mass for violent conflict.  The USAID/Central Asia Region mission launched in June 2002 a new Community Action Investment Program (CAIP), which is intended to mitigate sources of conflict in targeted communities that are considered to be potential hotspots where violent conflict could erupt.  Under CAIP, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are working with communities to help them identify and solve local issues through community planning, action and projects.  CAIP will encourage broad-based community involvement in small scale, relatively labor intensive community infrastructure projects.  Some examples of community-selected projects are: constructing, refurbishing and re-equipping schools and recreation facilities, youth and community centers, health clinics, or small-scale water supply and sanitation systems. These projects will improve social services, create jobs, and increase participation and direct citizen involvement in decisions that most directly affect their lives. CAIP is active in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.  We do not intend to conduct polling in Turkmenistan.

OBJECTIVE AND TASKS:  In order to assess the impact of our conflict mitigation program in these target communities, USAID/CAR intends to procure the services of a contractor to conduct polls in the regions in which CAIP operates.

THE CONTRACTOR WILL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS:
1. Designate which population groups will comprise the sample and control populations - based on information provided by CAIP implementers regarding (a) target communities that they have chosen and (b) selection criteria that they used to choose target communities.
2. Survey a representative sample of citizens among CAIP communities in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan every 6 months over a 3-year period.  The polling questionnaire will be proposed and approved by USAID/CAR, but the final version will incorporate suggestions from CAIP implementers and the polling firm.  This polling activity will entail 5 complete surveys - 3/03, 9/03, 3/04, 9/04, 3/05.  (Note: the current set of CAIP cooperative agreements will end in May 2005.)
3. Survey the control population from non-CAIP communities in each country, using the same polling instrument as with the sample population from CAIP-target communities.
4. Analyze the results, in particular focusing on how the sample population differs from the control, and how CAIP target communities themselves have developed over time.  The purpose here is to show the extent to which CAIP has had an impact - both in terms of comparison against baseline for each community, and comparison against similar non-CAIP communities.  This will likely mean that a longitudinal study would be used, which requires surveyors to return to the same communities over repeated iterations of the survey.
5. Conduct a series of focus groups in several CAIP communities on an annual basis, as warranted by CAIP implementers or USAID/CAR recommendation.  These could be used to understand why CAIP worked especially well - or not - in some particular targeted communities, so that the entire set of implementers could benefit from lessons learned.

The first poll will be conducted in late March or early April 2003. The information obtained by this contract shall be used to analyze levels of trust, social tensions, and conflict in CAIP communities.  Polling data will also measure community satisfaction with the participatory process, initiated projects, and quality of social services.  Focus group sessions will help USAID understand differences in success rates among communities and countries.

The Contractor is required to supply the USAID/CAR/Program Office with the survey data in a timely manner, including standard cross-tabulations by major demographic variables (see Deliverables). The data collection stipulated in this contract and processing of data obtained shall be completed within 2 weeks of each poll. 

The Contractor shall poll a given number of people in both CAIP and non-CAIP community populations. That number will be negotiated, depending on the budget scenarios proposed.  For more details concerning sampling for budget purposes, see the section titled "Sampling Issues".  USAID/CAR has developed the questionnaire that will be provided upon request to interested offerors.  

SAMPLING ISSUES: Contractor will select a representative sample of CAIP communities from each country (and each region--i.e., Khatlon vs Rasht--in the case of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan).  The Contractor will also work with the CAIP implementers to select a population of similar communities in which they are not working, and this set will serve as the control population.  The control population should obviously share as many characteristics as possible with the CAIP communities, and CAIP implementers provide the Contractor with their sets of criteria for selecting CAIP communities and will help identify the set of communities that fall in this population.  
 
The USAID/Central Asia mission will need to determine whether the two populations of CAIP and non-CAIP target communities are significantly different, in order to be able to make such statements as "We conclude that our community development activities under CAIP are (or are not) having a significant positive impact on the diminishing of intra-community tensions, based on a comparison of communities in which CAIP does work with similar vulnerable communities in which CAIP does not work". The rough average population of CAIP communities is about 1,000. USAID is interested in results with a confidence level of either 90% or 95%, and requires at least two budget scenarios that reflect different levels of confidence and associated costs.  Contractor will describe in the Proposal which probability methods for random sampling from these populations they would use to guarantee maximal level of confidence within realistic budget limits.
 
During the first iteration of the community poll, the number of communities in each country will look like this: Uzbekistan (Ferghana / Namangan / Andijan) - 25; Uzbekistan (Surkhandarya / Kashkadarya) - 60; Kyrgyzstan (Osh / Jalalabad / Batken) - 28; Kazakhstan (South / Almaty / Dzhambul) - 16; Tajikistan (Khatlon) - 19; Tajikistan (Rasht) - 73; Tajikistan (Soghd) - 7.
 
During the second and subsequent iterations, the number of communities in each country (area) will look like this: Uzbekistan (Ferghana / Namangan / Andijan) - 30; Uzbekistan (Surkhandarya / Kashkadarya) - 90; Kyrgyzstan (Osh / Jalalabad / Batken) - 45; Kazakhstan (South / Almaty / Dzhambul) - 24; Tajikistan (Khatlon) - 23; Tajikistan (Rasht) - 79; Tajikistan (Soghd) - 10.

DELIVERABLES: The Contractor shall fulfill each of these Tasks in each of the four target countries. The Contractor shall use the questions put forward by USAID/CAR, but the Contractor may propose alternative wording for these questions in order to improve clarity or cultural sensitivity.  USAID requires that the same set of questions be asked in each country, in order to guarantee that results can be aggregated for the entire sample population.  Questions must be approved by USAID/CAR before implementation of the surveys.  

Whilst analyzing the data, responses shall be broken down according to the following categories: age (disaggregated by 15-25, 26-40, 41-55, over 55); gender; nationality (ethnicity); occupation (student, pensioner, unemployed, housewife, manager, specialist, worker); approximate income; location (town, rayon, oblast, etc.).

USAID/CAR will have the right of final decision whether and when each Task must be implemented.  USAID/CAR shall retain the right to change questions in each Task. In such case, the Contractor will be informed in advance to have enough time to make changes in the polls.  The data obtained in the course of each Task will be the property of USAID/CAR. The Contractor shall disclose no data unless USAID/CAR gives a written approval for such disclosure.

After completion of each poll, 1 report for each country shall be delivered to USAID/CAR. The Contractor shall deliver to USAID/CAR all the data related to the above questions within 2 weeks after completion of each Task. The Report and cross-tabulation tables (as Word and Excel files) shall be delivered as an electronic copy (on diskettes or by e-mail) and as a hard copy both in Russian and English languages. The Contractor shall also retain an electronic copy of raw database and submit it to USAID/CAR, if required.

SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS: The proposal shall be submitted in two separate parts: (a) technical and (b) cost. The technical proposal should be limited, exclusive of resumes and past performance annexes to 20 pages. The past performance references and resumes shall be included as an annex. The technical proposal should, at a minimum, include the following: describe the methodology to conducting work in each country; management plan for executing the contract; staffing plan shall define who will be employed under the contract, for what purposes, full resumes of key personnel must be appended; past performance and experience. The Cost Proposal shall provide a detailed budget and Budget Notes with assumptions in a narrative in sufficient detail to allow a complete analysis of each line item cost. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA: BEST VALUE: The Contracting Officer will use "Best Value" to determine the proposal most advantageous to the U.S. Government. The evaluation factors, and the subfactors thereof, are listed below in their relative order of importance.  Contract award shall be made to the responsive and responsible offeror whose combined technical and cost proposal offer the best value to the U.S. Government.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Proven data collection and analysis expertise: 
a). The organization proposes a methodology that will result in the sort of data that we require for our management purposes; and 
b). The organization's references vouch for their abilities to carry out work such as that proposed in the Scope of Work;

4. Experience in Central Asia.  The organization has carried out polls and survey instruments in Central Asian countries.
5.  Experience with international organizations.  The organization shows familiarity with the standards for data analysis, timeliness, and other administrative issues that international organizations demand.

Therefore the initial offer must contain and meet all the Government requirements. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines discussions are necessary.
