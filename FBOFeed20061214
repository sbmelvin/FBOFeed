<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source bridge contract with Covenant Homeland Security Solution, Ltd, while the follow-on competitive acquisition and transition is completed. The follow-on competitive acquisition began with a Sources Sought Notice (DE-RI01-06SA00001) which was issued on July 25, 2006. This Sources Sought Notice requested capability statements from qualified small businesses for the ‚ÄúOffice of Health, Safety and Security (HSS) Protective Force services in the National Capital Area for DOE‚Äù. A Request for Proposals (RFP) for the follow-on acquisition is scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2007. The proposed bridge contract will provide continued high quality Protective Force services to HSS. This support is currently being performed by Covenant Homeland Security Solution, Ltd under contract number DE-AC01-05SO20222 and will expire on January 31, 2007. HSS is responsible for the development, promulgation, and evaluation of security programs, and the oversight of safeguards and security; cyber security; emergency management; and environment , safety, and health programs throughout the Department.  Within HSS is the Office of Headquarters Security Operations (HS-1.31), which provides protection of the Department‚Äôs facilities in the National Capital Area, the health and safety of assigned personnel, and the classified, sensitive, and unclassified property and matter in those facilities, and ensures the continuity of government (COG) in all circumstances mandated by Presidential Decision Directives.  Protection and physical access control is provided 24 hours a day, 365 days a year at the Forrestal building and satellite facilities in Washington, DC, the Germantown facility and satellite facilities in Germantown, Maryland.  The Performance Work Statement (PWS), Position Qualifications, and estimated level of effort for this Covenant Homeland Security Services, Ltd contract are provided on the Department‚Äôs Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at: http://e-center.doe.gov/. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 USC 2304[c][1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency‚Äôs requirements. Covenant Homeland Security Services has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security clearances, technical skill and training, who are familiar with the program and requirements, and who are available to provide services pending the award of a competitive follow-on contract. In addition, all personnel are required to have DOE ‚ÄúQ‚Äù level security clearances to perform work under this contract. Based on current experience, it takes at least 6 months and possibly as long as a year for the clearance approval process to be completed. There are approximately 200 individuals working on the existing contract. If this bridge contract does not get approved, not only would there be a significant delay due to the time required to conduct a competitive procurement, but there would be additional delays in order for individuals to acquire the appropriate security clearances. Covenant Homeland Security Service staff has the requisite knowledge and experience and required security clearances, and can proceed without interruption. Firms who want to be considered for the short term sole-source requirement must submit an interest letter that demonstrates: 1) the firm's ability to perform the work as described in the current contract Statement of Work provided at the DOE IIPS website referenced above; and 2) the firm‚Äôs ability to provide the requisite personnel with the appropriate DOE ‚ÄúQ‚Äù level security clearances to perform work commencing February 1, 2007. Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered within thirty (30) days of this notice to the DOE IIPS website If a determination is subsequently made by the Government to compete for these services (planned to be provided under this bridge contract by Covenant Homeland Security Service), a competition will be conducted for the three 3-month option periods. It would not be possible to conduct this competition for the initial 6-month period, and as described above, it is unacceptable to have a break in service for this work. Thus, the bridge contract would continue during the entire 6-month initial period while the competition is being held for the available option period(s) needed until the competitive acquisition under DE-RI01-06SA00001 is completed. A determination by the Government not to proceed with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The intent of this award is to provide the required Protective Force services until the award and transition of a competitive follow-on acquisition is completed as described in the first paragraph above. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 561612. The period of performance of this bridge contract is for a total of twelve months, consisting of an initial 6-month period and two 3-month option periods. ***See Numbered Note 22.

<SOLNBR>FA8629-07-R-2384
<RESPDATE>010307
<ARCHDATE>12182007
<CONTACT>Katherine Hamblin, (937) 255-3594
<DESC>1.  The USAF Aeronautical Systems Centerís 356th Aeronautical Systems Group (356 AESG) is soliciting information to analyze alternatives  for the GMS2 Follow-on Production effort.  GMS2 is to replace the current  All Light Level Television (ALLTV) system and provide AC-130U Gunship  operators with improved capability to detect/recognize/identify targets  under all light level conditions without the aid of artificial  illumination sources, to support accurate weapons delivery, and to provide  improved differentiation between friendly and hostile forces.  This  announcement is issued for informational planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation or commit the Government to award a contract  now or in the future.  Submitting information for this announcement is  voluntary, and participants will not be compensated. A multi-spectral 360 degree field-of-regard sensor system is required to  meet current operational requirements.  Information on complete,  production-ready, non-developmental (NDI) systems is desired.  Systems in  the concept or design/development phase are not of interest, i.e., they  must be fully functional and flight tested.  Following a technical review  to determine viable candidates, you may be invited to demonstrate system  capabilities including, but not limited to, MIL-STD-1553 data bus  compatibility and RS-422 communications at the Boeing Systems Integration  Laboratory (SIL).  Contractors selected to conduct this demonstration  shall be required to bring their candidate systems to the government SIL  no later than 10 working days following notification. Key Performance Capabilities:  Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) include  target and ground party identification capability at AFSOC specified slant  ranges.  The sensor capability must enable AC-130U sensor operators to  detect, recognize, and identify potential targets and friendly ground  parties throughout the aircraft operational envelope during AFSOC missions  including the entire range of environmental conditions that may be  encountered.  A capability for detecting USSOCOM near-Infrared pointers,  strobes, beacons, and markers during night operations is required.  The  multi-spectral sensor system should employ imagery enhancement techniques  to improve target detection and identification.  The system shall also  contain integrated eye-safe and tactical laser range finders/designators  and a near-infrared laser pointer.  The system shall provide line-of-sight  pointing information to the aircraft to support accurate weapons delivery. The system must be capable of being fully integrated into the AC-130U fire  control system.  All line replaceable units (LRUs) shall be replaceable at  the organizational level.  The system must be ruggedized for military  operations to include heat, cold, noise, humidity, and vibration, and be  capable of operating in outside air temperatures of -40 to +55 degrees  Celsius.  Climate/environmental/temperature control shall be  self-contained in the sensor turret and not require an external source.  The system must be capable of operating from a MIL-STD-1553 data bus  and/or backup controls.  Loss of a primary sensor (electro-optic or  forward-looking infrared) shall not degrade operation of the remaining  sensors.  The system should be passive and must be able to detect and  identify various targets at various ranges and conditions.  The specific  targets and ranges can be found in a classified appendix to the GMS2  Systems Requirements Document (SRD).. 2.  Further capabilities required are contained in the GMS2 SRD and its  classified appendix.  To review these documents, requestors must possess a  valid site security clearance and an appropriate CAGE code.  The full name  of the company security POC authorized to sign for classified documents  and approved for pick-up of classified materials should be identified.  Potential suppliers may need to assist the Government in completing a DD  Form 254 prior to exchange of any classified information.  Requests to  view the SRD and its classified appendix should be addressed to the  following security point of contact NLT 20 December 2006: 	356 AESG/SF 	ATTN:  Mrs. Denise D. Williams 	1895 Fifth Street, Bldg 46 	Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7200 Telephone 937-255-4713; e-mail: Denise.Quick-Williams@wpafb.af.mil. FAX#:  937-656-5690 3.  Life Cycle Cost.  All elements of development, production, and  sustainment costs are important.  Innovative approaches that minimize  integration cost with the fire control system and sensor controls/displays  are of particularly high interest. 4.  Sensor system delivery and integration schedule should be addressed. 5.  It is desirable that responses be submitted on CD-ROM in an electronic  format that is compatible with Microsoft Windows/Office.

The Navy intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Rentfrow Inc. of Ventura, CA, who is the incumbent contractor.  Technical services are required to develop, design, execute, operate, and sustain existing FIS transactional interfaces. Due to ongoing transformation changes, it is determined to be in the best interest of the government to issue an award to the incumbent contractor, who can meet the current rigid schedule and technical requirements.  Senior level technical services are required for specific enterprise integration tasks. Period of performance is through 30 September 2007.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Center intends to procure services of the Regents of University of California, Office of Research Affairs, 333 California Street, Ste 11 PO 9, San Francisco, CA 94143 with Dr. Dean T. Jamison Senior Editor, Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCPP).  Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd edition (DCP2) reported evidence on the cost-effectiveness of over 300 health interventions. It attempted to ensure coverage of the most important interventions, to be up-to-date in terms of costs and of effectiveness studies, and to undertake all cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) according to a pre-established common methodology. While this methodological goal was realized in part, the diversity of DCP2 authors, and the elapsed time of the undertaking, has resulted in substantial unevenness. New information will, as well, continue to be published and new cost and technical options will become available. To keep the CEA database for DCP2 up-to-date, and to improve it gradually over time, will require an explicit analytic effort, continued management and an institutional home. This proposal suggests that the Fogarty International Center (FIC) of the NIH provide the institutional home and that management of the analytic effort be contracted to the University of California, San Francisco (Global Health Sciences) with Prof. D. T. Jamison serving as Principal Investigator.   During the period from early 2002 through the present, FIC provided the institutional home for the Disease Control Priorities Project (DCPP), which has resulted in a series of publications including two major edited volumes published by Oxford University Press in April 2006: Disease Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd edition (DCP2) and Global Burden of Disease and Risk Factors. One major purpose of DCP2 was to assemble evidence on what works and at what cost for addressing the diseases and risk factors most important in the low ?and middle-income countries. Results from the individual chapters were drawn together in a synthesizing chapter (Chapter 2) of the book and in a major article for the Lancet. The 315 interventions included in the synthesis were categorized in a number of dimensions, including the completeness and adequacy of the CEA undertaken, the purpose of the intervention (primary prevention, cure, etc.) and whether the intervention was addressed to populations or to individuals. The 315 interventions are listed, with some degree of characterization of each one, in what might be labeled the "DCPP Intervention Data Base". It is the purpose of the activity proposed in this document to transform this Data Base from a static summary of what has already been done into a dynamic, web-based data base that will improve and grow with time. An expanded and evolving DCPP Intervention Data Base would form a core around which a possible 3rd edition of DCP could be constructed and it would be a useful and coherent reference independently of any decision about proceeding with a DCP 3. A DCPP Intervention Data Base that is enriched to include the full range of information in the DCPP intervention characterization template.  An identification (with rationale) of priority areas for revising the CEAs in the existing Data Base.  A listing (with rationales) of priorities for new interventions to include in the Data Base.   A cost-effectiveness analysis (or analyses) for treatment of severe malaria with (principal responsibility to lie with DCPPIFIC postdoctoral fellow).   Revised cost-effectiveness analyses for rotavirus and hepatitis B vaccines (subject to availability of funding).   Additional deliverables would be provided if resources become available to undertake specific additional cost-effectiveness analyses.  Dr. Jamison has been the Senior Editor for the project since its inception ahs has led the work on DCPP cost-effectiveness analysis under the auspices of his prior intergovernmental personnel agreement.  He originated the broad framework for full characterization of interventions that is to be used in this effort an is uniquely placed to applying it to actual and potential DCPP interventions.  The academic and scientific areas covered are areas in which Dr. Jamison has published and for which his training in economics (Ph.D., Harvard) prepares him.  To the best of the Governments knowledge the proposed contractor is the only known source that can provide the services that we require.  Interested vendors may identify in writing their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.   This will be for a base year plus one option year.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received, before the closing date of this announcement, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  It is anticipated that the Request for Quotation (RFQ) NIH-NIDDK-07-104 will be available fifteen (15) days after the release of the RFQ.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  The anticipated award date is January 8, 2007.  Request for copies of the RFQ must be in writing to the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 6707 Democracy Blvd., Room 774B, Bethesda, MD 20817 Attention:  V.

The proposed two year effort entails providing labor and services in support of the CERCLA program at JPL, including daily on-site technical and administrative responsibilities.  Contractor staff will work directly with the NASA Remedial Project Manager (RPM) and NASA Public Outreach Manager to address a multitude of issues associated with cleanup activities under CERCLA.  Specific activities include but are not limited to technical reviews, maintaining and updating Administrative Records and the Website, coordinating cleanup efforts/logistics, community outreach support, and organizing/conducting meetings with federal regulatory and local government agencies.	  In addition, the contractor will continue and complete design and construction of the Operable Unit - 3 treatment plant, Operable Unit - 1 construction expansion, and integration with the current operation system.	Contract will manage groundwater monitoring activities to provide additional data to support groundwater modeling efforts presently being conducted, and fulfill regulatory requirements.  The contractor will be responsible for monitoring and optimizing system operations for the length of the contract.  Operations consist of daily monitoring of the purification systems, laboratory analysis of process water, data evaluation and interpretation, progress reporting, system maintenance, and material management. These efforts will also require frequent interaction with the NASA RPM.	Deliverables include various progress reports as well as special reports as requested.	 NASA will accept, for consideration, capability statements submitted by all parties interested in performing the aforementioned effort; however, due to critical scheduling considerations, NASAís intentions at this time is to award the follow-on contract to the current contractor.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. There is no solicitation package available at this time.  Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, operator of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is seeking sources to supply a dedicated Metabolomics 600 LC-NMR Spectrometer System for use at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory.  We are looking for potential sources for this requirement and comments to our draft specifications. Draft specifications may be downloaded from this website.  All interested parties should send company?s capability, descriptive literature, cost estimate and comments to the primary point of contact.  All questions and comments must be in writing, email is acceptable, no telephone calls.  We will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will we compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to us.

This system would be dedicated to the field of metabonomics, a rapidly growing area of research with much user interest, both inside and outside PNNL. System would be a workhorse enabling accurate lineshape deconvolution and analysis of biomarkers in complex mixtures. LC NMR samples of metabolites would be compared with LC Mass Spec results.  This combination approach would make the overall capability more powerful than either NMR or Mass Soec alone.  The cold-probe capability would expand sensitivity of system to enable detection of trace metabolites/compounds.  Two cold probes, one optimized for 1H detection and the other for 13C detection would be a great advantage for metabonomic users.

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is seeking industry feedback on current and future advanced display technologies.  The purpose of the RFI is to gather industry-wide feedback on current and upcoming display technologies that can view flicker-free stereoscopic imagery and exhibit smooth and continuous, blur-free roam capabilities.

2. NOTICE. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties? expense.   Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in a future RFP, if one is issued.

3. BACKGROUND. NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate geospatial-intelligence in support of national security objectives. Geospatial-intelligence is the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the Earth. The NGA mission requires the display of softcopy geospatial data in both monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing modes with high resolution and image quality.  NGA currently utilizes high-resolution Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) monitors to provide continuous blur-free motion roam functionality and view stereoscopic image pairs. Monochrome CRT displays have historically been used for panchromatic imagery exploitation owing to their excellent sharpness and high dynamic range, enabling the observer to distinguish details in the imagery.  Color CRT displays have historically been used for color imagery exploitation and presentation of color text and graphics. Geospatial-intelligence analysts use specialized COTS image viewer applications such as RemoteView, SOCET SET/GXP, ERDAS Imagine, ENVI, and Image Scout while exploiting and analyzing imagery in stereo and in roaming the image.  CRT monitors perform exceptionally well in the area of image roam performance.  CRT roam is a smooth and continuous panning motion directed by the geospatial-intelligence analyst through large-area images.  Blur-free image motion enables the analyst to detect faint target objects of interest while searching through the image.  The addition of an active polarizing filter and passive polarized glasses allows analysts to resolve two images from a stereo pair into a true stereoscopic image.


4. INFORMATION REQUEST. NGA is requesting information on desktop display technologies that can exhibit capabilities of smooth continuous, blur-free motion roam and/or flicker-free stereoscopic image pairs.  NGA is interested in what technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are currently available, what technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are being planned, and the timeframe when technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are planned to be available. Interested parties are requested to submit the following information for each display technology on the provided Display Technology Submission Form, attached to a cover letter with points of contact (POCs).

Single or Multiple screen display
In/Near Production or Prototype
Display Type (IPS or PVA LCD, Plasma, etc.)
Color or Grayscale (color gamut or whitepoint)
Luminance Response
Calibration (Integrated photo sensors, 10-bit look-up tables, user-defined aim, remote access)
Pixel response time (msec)
Pixel density (pixels per inch)
Pixel format (Minimum of 1920 x 1200)
Refresh rate (Minimum 60 Hz per eye for flicker-free stereo)
Roam rate (Minimum 750 pixels/second)
Display Size (Minimum 20 inches diagonal)
Dimensions (W x H x D)
Power consumption (watts)
Lifetime (Minimum 25,000 hours)
Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF)
Projected price per unit ($)
Projected availability (currently available, 1-3 months, etc.)
Available for Demo (yes/no)
	
NGA recognizes that vendors can provide other pertinent information to distinguish their products, and are encouraged to do so. For example, a minimum of 60Hz refresh rate (per image) is considered necessary for Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) to display flicker-free stereoscopic image pairs, though other means may be used in flat panels to achieve the desired result while having a refresh rate less than 60 Hz.

5. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS. Interested parties are requested to complete the display technology information submission form no later than 26 January 2007 to Tracie.L.Flora@nga.mil or fax it to 703-755-5601.  The form will be posted by 15 December 2006 on www.nga.mil under Business Opportunities.

6. POINT OF CONTACT. Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Robert Crain, Robert.C.Crain@nga.mil, and Arthur Cobb, Arthur.L.Cobb@nga.mil.

7. SUMMARY. This RFI is to obtain useful market information concerning desktop flat panel display technology currently in production, in R&D or in future plans.

Wolfe Street, E-6533, Baltimore, MD  21205 for a study entitled ?Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and tobacco use among injection drug users.?  The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5M.  People infected with HIV have an elevated risk of lung cancer.  The excess risk of lung cancer among HIV-infected individuals is partly due to frequent tobacco use, but recent evidence indicates that not all of the excess risk of lung cancer can be explained by smoking.  The purpose of this procurement is to obtain data that will allow a detailed comparison of lung cancer risk factors in a large population of HIV-infected and uninfected drug users.  The specific objectives are to compare detailed smoking history and other lung cancer risk factors among HIV-infected and uninfected drug users, and to compare lung spirometry results in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected drug users.  The contractor shall enroll subjects for the study described in the contract, from a population (cohort) of at least 1000 injection drug users followed longitudinally in a research setting at a single U.S. institution.  The contractor shall have data on this cohort derived through previous research studies, with respect to prevalence of HIV infection, drug abuse patterns, and smoking status.  At least 20% of the cohort will be known to be HIV-infected and at least 20% of the cohort will be known to be HIV-uninfected.  The contractor shall also have a repository of biospecimens on the cohort subjects.  Johns Hopkins School of Public Health is the only source known to the NCI researcher that runs the AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) Study of drug users, which has the required number of subjects and data.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of the synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington,D.C. time) on December 28, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Malinda Holdcraft at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in or to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The 184-N consists of 4 attached structures; the 184 N Power House, the 184 NA Power House annex, the 184-NE compressed gas sheds, and the 184 NF chemical injection pump room.

The 184 N Power House is a 34 m by 29 m by 21 m (112 ft by 96 ft by 70 ft) reinforced-concrete and structural steel building with channeled steel siding on the above-grade portions of the facility.  There is a steel stack 21-m (70-ft) in height from the 17-m (56-ft) roof level.  The facility housed a 15,000 kilowatt turbine generator that was driven by reactor generated steam or by a 575,000 Btu/hr boiler contained in the facility or by associated auxiliary equipment, air compressors, and compressed air receivers.  Chemicals used for water quality control were stored in the facility, and contamination of the facility occurred from pump/equipment leaks.  There is an adjacent facility approximately 15-m (50-ft) to the west.

The 184 NA Power House annex is a 418.5 m2 (4,500 ft2) metal on metal frame building that housed two boilers serving as backups to the main boiler in the 184 N Facility.  The structure shares a common wall with the 184 N Building on the west side.  The boiler steam drums and piping received radioactive contamination from recirculated reactor secondary system water.  East of the 184-NA is an associated steel stack that extends from grade to a height of approximately 24-m (80-ft).  There is an adjacent active power line approximately 13-m (40-ft) east of the stack.

The 184-NE compressed gas sheds consist of two small sheds each approximately 7-m2 (75-ft2) used to store compressed gas cylinders.  Gas piping ran from the gas cylinders inside the sheds into the 184-N Power House.  The sheds share a common wall with the 184 N Power House and are located on the south side of 184-N.  

The 184 NF chemical injection pump is within an approximately 9-m2 (96-ft2) pre engineered, single story steel frame building with metal siding and roofing.  The facility housed the aqueous ammonia injection system that injected ammonia for water quality into the 109 N Facility?s secondary water system.  

SUBCONTRACTOR shall be responsible for building implosion, felling the stacks, fracturing concrete foundations and pedestals, and large component size reduction of the 184-N, to include mobilization, dust and fragment projectile controls, drilling, waste handling (excluding demolition rubble), demobilization, and other work necessary to implode the 184-N, fell the stacks, size reduce specified components, and fracture heavy concrete material into no larger than 0.9m (3ft) in dimension in accordance with this contract. The CONTRACTOR will remove demolition rubble.
:::
Construction drawings for 116-N and 184-N will be provided as part of the subcontract documents.  The primary pay item within the Subcontract will be lump sum. The subcontractor will be expected to provide a full-time on-site site superintendent, a full-time on-site health and safety/IH representative, and a project manager.

<DESC>This is modification 5 to the synopsis entitled Constellation Space Suit System (CSSS) Solicitation No NNJ06161022R which was posted on August 2, 2006. You are notified that the Government is considering requesting the following data from potential offerors. The CSSS procurement team is soliciting Industry comments regarding a contemplated contract strategy. In answering this request for information, assume the requirements, EVA Systems Architecture and Reference Suit System Approach described in the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems Architecture presentation dated 11/1/06, are still valid.  This presentation is posted in the CSSS technical library.  NASA is considering implementing the EVA Systems architecture through a contract structure with a baseline portion and two options.  The contemplated structure is described below and depicted graphically in Figure 1. This can be viewed at:  http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/CSSS/Figure_1_rev_1.ppt   Baseline portion of the contract ñ It is contemplated that this portion of the contract consists of the Design, Development, Test and Evaluation (DDT&E) of the initial suit capabilities, referred to as Configuration 1 in the architecture presentation, through the first operational flight of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).  The baseline portion of the contract would also include DDT&E on the initial surface capabilities, referred to as Configuration 2, through the delta System Requirements Review (SRR) for lunar capabilities, currently scheduled for 2010.  This effort is included in the baseline portion of the contract to promote suit system commonality.  The term of this portion of the contract is envisioned to be approximately 6 years (2008 ñ 2014). Option 1. ñ It is contemplated that this portion of the contract consists of the remaining DDT&E for the completion of initial surface capabilities (Configuration 2) from the delta SRR through the first human flight of Configuration 2.  The term of this portion of the contract is envisioned to be approximately 8 years (2010 ñ 2018).  NASA is considering requesting proposals for this portion of the contract as a not to exceed (NTE) cost.  The negotiated value of Option 1 will not exceed the NTE value proposed for Option 1, unless the Government directs changes as a result of the delta SRR process.   Option 2. ñ It is contemplated that this portion of the contract will be ID/IQ and consist of the production and sustaining engineering of the initial suit capabilities (Configuration 1) through the first human flight of Configuration 2.  The term of this portion of the contract is envisioned to be approximately 5 years (2014 ñ 2018).  NASA is considering requesting proposals for this portion of the contract as NTEs for standard production buys and sustaining engineering rates.  The Government is seeking input on how to best implement the strategies outlined above.  Parties are asked to provide information on: 1.  Suitability of the proposed contract structure for implementing the EVA Systems Architecture. 2.  Ability of Industry to provide NTEs for the proposed options for the performance periods. 3.  Any comments to the EVA Systems Architecture and Reference Suit System Approach described in the 11/1/06 EVA Systems Architecture presentation. The information requested in this modification to the synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is seeking industry feedback on current and future advanced display technologies.  The purpose of the RFI is to gather industry-wide feedback on current and upcoming display technologies that can view flicker-free stereoscopic imagery and exhibit smooth and continuous, blur-free roam capabilities.

2. NOTICE. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties? expense.   Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in a future RFP, if one is issued.

3. BACKGROUND. NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate geospatial-intelligence in support of national security objectives. Geospatial-intelligence is the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the Earth. The NGA mission requires the display of softcopy geospatial data in both monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing modes with high resolution and image quality.  NGA currently utilizes high-resolution Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) monitors to provide continuous blur-free motion roam functionality and view stereoscopic image pairs. Monochrome CRT displays have historically been used for panchromatic imagery exploitation owing to their excellent sharpness and high dynamic range, enabling the observer to distinguish details in the imagery.  Color CRT displays have historically been used for color imagery exploitation and presentation of color text and graphics. Geospatial-intelligence analysts use specialized COTS image viewer applications such as RemoteView, SOCET SET/GXP, ERDAS Imagine, ENVI, and Image Scout while exploiting and analyzing imagery in stereo and in roaming the image.  CRT monitors perform exceptionally well in the area of image roam performance.  CRT roam is a smooth and continuous panning motion directed by the geospatial-intelligence analyst through large-area images.  Blur-free image motion enables the analyst to detect faint target objects of interest while searching through the image.  The addition of an active polarizing filter and passive polarized glasses allows analysts to resolve two images from a stereo pair into a true stereoscopic image.


4. INFORMATION REQUEST. NGA is requesting information on desktop display technologies that can exhibit capabilities of smooth continuous, blur-free motion roam and/or flicker-free stereoscopic image pairs.  NGA is interested in what technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are currently available, what technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are being planned, and the timeframe when technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are planned to be available. Interested parties are requested to submit the following information for each display technology on the provided Display Technology Submission Form, attached to a cover letter with points of contact (POCs).

Single or Multiple screen display
In/Near Production or Prototype
Display Type (IPS or PVA LCD, Plasma, etc.)
Color or Grayscale (color gamut or whitepoint)
Luminance Response
Calibration (Integrated photo sensors, 10-bit look-up tables, user-defined aim, remote access)
Pixel response time (msec)
Pixel density (pixels per inch)
Pixel format (Minimum of 1920 x 1200)
Refresh rate (Minimum 60 Hz per eye for flicker-free stereo)
Roam rate (Minimum 750 pixels/second)
Display Size (Minimum 20 inches diagonal)
Dimensions (W x H x D)
Power consumption (watts)
Lifetime (Minimum 25,000 hours)
Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF)
Projected price per unit ($)
Projected availability (currently available, 1-3 months, etc.)
Available for Demo (yes/no)
	
NGA recognizes that vendors can provide other pertinent information to distinguish their products, and are encouraged to do so. For example, a minimum of 60Hz refresh rate (per image) is considered necessary for Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) to display flicker-free stereoscopic image pairs, though other means may be used in flat panels to achieve the desired result while having a refresh rate less than 60 Hz.

5. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS. Interested parties are requested to complete the display technology information submission form no later than 26 January 2007 to Tracie.L.Flora@nga.mil or fax it to 703-755-5601.  The form will be posted by 15 December 2006 on www.nga.mil under Business Opportunities.

6. POINT OF CONTACT. Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Robert Crain, Robert.C.Crain@nga.mil, and Arthur Cobb, Arthur.L.Cobb@nga.mil.

7. SUMMARY. This RFI is to obtain useful market information concerning desktop flat panel display technology currently in production, in R&D or in future plans.

The Clinical Trials Core (CTC), Vaccine Research Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducts Phase I trials of candidate HIV vaccines and other vaccines developed by the VRC. CTC clinical research staff participate in various activities such as recruitment, screening, interviewing and enrolling vaccine volunteers into trials, follow up visits, and data management. In addition, the Clinical Trials Core participates in community education on HIV prevention, recruitment of healthy adults into clinical trials, study design and analysis, and maintenance of regulatory standards.  
 
The VRC wishes to obtain services provided in a Mobile Clinic to enhance the VRC?s ability to reach its intended audience of potential research study participants in the specific areas of recruitment, enrollment, advertising, provision of services, volunteer retainment, and follow up.   Therefore,  the NIAID Acquisitions and Operations Branch (AMOB) is seeking sources to furnish, outfit, maintain, house, and operate a vehicle for use by the VRC as a Mobile Clinic.  The Mobile Clinic will be used for recruitment, screening, protocol visits, education, counseling, follow-up, and outreach programs for clinical trial volunteers.  The Mobile Clinic will be staffed by VRC personnel.  All maintenance and operation of the vehicle will be provided by the contractor to include a driver, maintenance, housing, parking, licensing, insurance, and other operational requirements.  A list of required equipment is attached to this notice for informational purposes.  It is expected that the vehicle will initially be used 3 days per week for approximately 6 hours per day.  The vehicle will also be used for special events related to the Mobile Clinic?s mission.  The NIAID anticipates a one-year contract with four (4) one-year options.  Interested parties must provide a capability statement which demonstrates that the contractor:  is able to provide an appropriate vehicle; has facilities necessary to house and maintain the vehicle; can provide for the consistent operation of the vehicle based on VRC requirements; and has experience performing requirements of similar nature.  An interested vendors list will be available for all parties responding to this Sources Sought Notice.  Vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to submit their contact information to the email address below, in advance of the deadline, in order to facilitate possible teaming/subcontracting arrangements with contractors who provide operational support.  Capability statements are limited to no more than 10 pages.  Capability statements must address the entire requirement including operation and maintenance support. This is not a request for proposals.  The intention of this announcement is to survey the market for potential offerors.  Capability statements must be submitted via email to Alexander Kramer at kramera@niaid.nih.gov on or before January 8, 2006 at 11:00am.  No hardcopy capability statements will be accepted.

Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System/Tier II Unmanned Aircraft System (STUAS/Tier II) Request for Information (RFI) Questions and Answers
12 December 2006
NAVAIR Public Release 06-0520
Distribution Statement A ? ?Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited?

1.  The NAVAIR Interoperability Profile (NIOP) referenced is Version 11.
  
Q 1a: This version specifies BR 10.71B as the standard return link waveform, but we believe this is being changed to BR 10.71A. Is BR 10.71A acceptable? 
A 1a: A new Joint Interoperability Profile for TCDL Systems will be available soon and will replace the requirement for the NAVAIR Interoperability Profile Version II.  BR-10.71A will be required.

Q 1b: Version 11 also requires a CDL BR 0.2 forward link. Provision of a standard CDL forward link for vehicle command and control is a cost and weight driver, if availability of a secondary radio is assumed. Can a waiver of compliance with the CDL forward link for the air vehicle be obtained? 
A 1b: A secondary radio should not be assumed.  A "standard" uplink data rate of 200Kbps will be required by the new Joint Interoperability Profile for TCDL Systems.

Q 1c: The RFI contains no reference to air traffic control communications. Are ATC comms from the UAV required for this system? 
A 1c: An Air Traffic Control (ATC) communication requirement should not be assumed.  ATC communications will not be required for Increment 0 but may be required for Increment 1.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. RESPONSES TO THIS RFI ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT. THIS RFI IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SOLICITED OR PROVIDED. Contractual questions or comments may be addressed to Mr. Michael McLoughlin at 301-757-5898, email Michael.mcloughlin@navy.mil. Technical questions or comments may be addressed in writing to Mr. Brad Johnson (email Bradley.johnson@navy.mil.)

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is interested in receiving information pertaining to US Banknote denominators for use by the blind and vision impaired community.  This reader must be able to determine the denomination of all United States currency  from series 1996 as well as the newer designs ( $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 denominations) This reader must also read and identify the existing $1 and $2 denominations ( and new $1 and $2 designs if applicable).

A banknote feature exists in series 1996 and newer currency designs that may facilitate a reliable cost-effective method to denominate currency. The Bureau will reveal details of a feature to potential suppliers upon execution of a non-disclosure agreement.

The Bureau welcomes the opportunity to work with colleges, universities, non-profit organizations, public institutions, and private sector organizations.

The bureau is interested in the following information:

?	Design concepts ( i.e. size, weight, usability, etc. )
?	Prototype availability
?	Finished product availability
?	Projected timeframe for prototype availability (if applicable)
?	Projected time for manufacturing (if applicable)
?	Projected purchase price in 1-500 quantities, 501-2500 quantities, and greater than 2500 quantities
?	Potential distribution channels
?	Expected life of unit
?	Replace-ability of power supply

Considerations for a valid banknote denominator design include:

?	Must be firmware updateable when new designs are released (USB port, serial port, etc. to allow for central distribution and download capability)
?	Must be convenient and easy for the blind and vision-impaired community to operate
?	Must be transported in a pocket with a reasonable battery/charge life
?	Preferred size envelope should not exceed 75mm x 75mm x 15mm
?	Must be able to read a banknote and determine its denomination in less than five (5) seconds
?	Must be able to optionally report read results with any sensory output other than visual (i.e. vibratory differentiations of currency denominations, voice module, refreshable Braille, etc )
?	Purchase price should be a low as possible ( less than $50 US )
?	Must be able to read from at least two of the four note presentation orientations, preferably any orientation
?	The misread rate should be no greater than one (1) per thousand (1000) notes read.
?	The misread signal should indicate an ? inconclusive ? result
?	Must allow for upgrades of future currency design
?	If design allows, permit the sensor technology to be OEM?ed into other portable devices such as cell phones.
?	Design should be based on reading current circulating currency in a wide range of physical conditions.

Please supply 2 copies of your written and 1 copy in electronic form. No E-mail submissions will be accepted. Deadline for submissions is 12 Noon EST on February 6, 2007. Requests for BEP Non-Disclosure forms and questions can be E-mailed to donald.baron@bep.treas.gov.

The Bureau will not reimburse anyone for proposal or prototype reader costs. This is a Request for Information.

<DESC>The United States Department of Education intends to make a sole source award to State Net for news, legislative, and regulatory tracking services. This solicitation will be awarded in accordance with the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii) and 13.106-1(b), as the contracting officer deems only one source reasonably available.  State Net is the only provider of news, legislative, and regulatory tracking services offered as a total customized package responding to the specific needs of the Department.  The service has the unique capability to provide on-line reports that are custom-screened and tailored to the Department's time-sensitive outreach and communication requirements.  That unique capability allows the Department to anticipate responses to state-level economic, regulatory, and legislative trends, rather than merely responding to them retroactively.  It also allows the Department to devise informed longitudinal approaches to those developments.  While other vendors researched offered limited services, none were able to meet the overall customized needs of the Department.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the government will consider all proposals received by the closing date of this synopsis.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responsible sources may submit a bid or quotation, which, if received timely, will be considered.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI), which is issued for planning purposes only.  The purpose of this RFI is to open a dialogue with industry to ensure to the maximum extent possible that industry input is given proper and due consideration in the development of a planned  FY07  DECM acquisition program. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in conjunction with the Naval Air Systems Command, is seeking industry participation in a series of hardware-in-the-loop tests of advanced electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems against simulated Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) and Air-to-Air Missiles (AAM) attacks.  The ECM tests will be conducted at one or more facilities using both vendor furnished equipment and Government furnished equipment (GFE).  Demonstrations of advanced Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) defensive electronic countermeasures (DECM) capabilities against coherent radars are desired.  The data generated by the ECM tests will allow the Government to better assess DRFM-based ECM techniques.  The desired DECM improvements will address deficiencies in the Navy and Marine Corps' existing ALQ-126B.  The vendor shall be responsible for providing all vendor furnished hardware and software to the ECM tests at no cost to the Government.  The ECM testing must be completed by 1 May 2007. Participation in the ECM tests requires prior corporate experience with, as a minimum,  (1) defensive electronic countermeasure systems on aircraft; (2) design and systems engineering , design verification, first article and qualification testing experience; (3) planning, coordinating and conducting tests to prove system performance, and; (4) system integration, manufacturing and delivering of hardware.  In addition, the vendor must possess both a valid DOD security clearance to at least the SECRET level and an approved classified storage facility (SECRET level).  Hardware provided by the vendor for the ECM tests must be at a Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL 6).  The recorded electronic responses of the vendor furnished equipment to the simulated threats that are obtained during the capabilities demonstration will be retained by the Government with rights compatible with NRL research and development objectives.  A copy of the recorded responses will be supplied to the participating vendor. 

Interested vendors must submit a request in writing to participate in the capabilities demonstration.  Each request will be evaluated according to the following factors, which are listed in descending order of importance: 

(1) The contractor?s ability to supply appropriate hardware and software as demonstrated by specific accomplishments in the DECM field and by the qualifications of the supporting personnel and related facilities and (2) Degree to which new and creative solutions towards improving DECM on Navy aircraft are addressed and feasibility and the contractor's understanding of the airborne ECM environment. (3) The degree to which technical data are to be generated by the ECM tests for the demonstration and evaluation of improved ECM effectiveness. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR PARTICIPATION ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.   NRL may contact selected vendors for subsequent technical discussions.

Participation in this testing is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, concerning participation in the planned acquisition program, should such a solicitation be issued.  There is no intention to award a contract based on this RFI.  The Government will not compensate any interested party, firm, or individual that may choose to provide a response to this RFI.  The following clause shall apply:

FAR 52.215-3 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997) 

(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. 
(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. 
(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of planning for an FY07 DECM acquisition program

Vendors interested in responding to this RFI may submit information by mail or e-mail in English not later than January 15, 2007.  Information may be submitted to: Naval Research Laboratory, ATTN: Gary Roan, Code 5713, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington, D.C.20375, or e-mail to gary.roan@nrl.navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>10--DTRA WAWF Implementation
<DESC>Defense Threat Reduction Agency --- Implements the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) process for electronic invoicing --- November 1, 2006.  On November 1, 2006, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) began implementing the Department of Defense (DOD) approved electronic invoicing process known as the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).  The WAWF process allows DTRA vendors an electronic means for submitting their payment requests and allows DTRA personnel a means to receive and accept these requests.  WAWF is a secure Web-based system that began as a Paperless Contracting prototype application to eliminate paper from the Receipt/Acceptance and Invoice/Payment process of the Department of Defense (DoD) contracting life cycle and has been operational since FY99.  DTRA is pursuing this in part to comply with language provided during the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to DOD to provide an electronic means to process invoices and vouchers for DOD related acquisitions and to provide a cost and time saving methodology to DTRA over the current paper process. Additionally, Public Law 106-398 requires that all vendors doing business with the Department of Defense (DoD) submit their invoices and supporting documentation electronically.  The Under Secretary of Defense identified Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) as the preferred system for meeting this statutory requirement.  Starting January 1, 2007 all new and any modified DTRA service contracts will contain the local WAWF electronic invoicing clause.  If your contract is awarded or modified after January 1st, 2007 you will need to submit your invoices/vouchers via the WAWF system.  Vendors are encouraged to visit the DTRA public webpage http://www.dtra.mil/be/business_opp/index.cfm for additional WAWF information and links to on-line training.  Vendors may also visit the following DFAS webpage for more detail WAWF information and to gain access to the WAWF Vendor Getting Started Guide available at: http://www.dod.mil/dfas/contractorpay/electroniccommerce/ECToolBox.html.   To take advantage of the benefits of WAWF, Vendors may call the WAWF Help Desk at 1-866-615-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil to establish their CAGE code in WAWF.

<SUBJECT>16--DTRA WAWF Implementation
<DESC>Defense Threat Reduction Agency --- Implements the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) process for electronic invoicing --- November 1, 2006.  On November 1, 2006, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) began implementing the Department of Defense (DOD) approved electronic invoicing process known as the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).  The WAWF process allows DTRA vendors an electronic means for submitting their payment requests and allows DTRA personnel a means to receive and accept these requests.  WAWF is a secure Web-based system that began as a Paperless Contracting prototype application to eliminate paper from the Receipt/Acceptance and Invoice/Payment process of the Department of Defense (DoD) contracting life cycle and has been operational since FY99.  DTRA is pursuing this in part to comply with language provided during the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to DOD to provide an electronic means to process invoices and vouchers for DOD related acquisitions and to provide a cost and time saving methodology to DTRA over the current paper process. Additionally, Public Law 106-398 requires that all vendors doing business with the Department of Defense (DoD) submit their invoices and supporting documentation electronically.  The Under Secretary of Defense identified Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) as the preferred system for meeting this statutory requirement.  Starting January 1, 2007 all new and any modified DTRA service contracts will contain the local WAWF electronic invoicing clause.  If your contract is awarded or modified after January 1st, 2007 you will need to submit your invoices/vouchers via the WAWF system.  Vendors are encouraged to visit the DTRA public webpage http://www.dtra.mil/be/business_opp/index.cfm for additional WAWF information and links to on-line training.  Vendors may also visit the following DFAS webpage for more detail WAWF information and to gain access to the WAWF Vendor Getting Started Guide available at: http://www.dod.mil/dfas/contractorpay/electroniccommerce/ECToolBox.html.   To take advantage of the benefits of WAWF, Vendors may call the WAWF Help Desk at 1-866-615-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil to establish their CAGE code in WAWF.  Vendors may self-register to use the system at:  https://wawf.eb.mil.

<DESC>Defense Threat Reduction Agency --- Implements the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) process for electronic invoicing --- November 1, 2006.  On November 1, 2006, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) began implementing the Department of Defense (DOD) approved electronic invoicing process known as the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).  The WAWF process allows DTRA vendors an electronic means for submitting their payment requests and allows DTRA personnel a means to receive and accept these requests.  WAWF is a secure Web-based system that began as a Paperless Contracting prototype application to eliminate paper from the Receipt/Acceptance and Invoice/Payment process of the Department of Defense (DoD) contracting life cycle and has been operational since FY99.  DTRA is pursuing this in part to comply with language provided during the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to DOD to provide an electronic means to process invoices and vouchers for DOD related acquisitions and to provide a cost and time saving methodology to DTRA over the current paper process. Additionally, Public Law 106-398 requires that all vendors doing business with the Department of Defense (DoD) submit their invoices and supporting documentation electronically.  The Under Secretary of Defense identified Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) as the preferred system for meeting this statutory requirement.  Starting January 1, 2007 all new and any modified DTRA service contracts will contain the local WAWF electronic invoicing clause.  If your contract is awarded or modified after January 1st, 2007 you will need to submit your invoices/vouchers via the WAWF system.

The WAWF process allows DTRA vendors an electronic means for submitting their payment requests and allows DTRA personnel a means to receive and accept these requests.  WAWF is a secure Web-based system that began as a Paperless Contracting prototype application to eliminate paper from the Receipt/Acceptance and Invoice/Payment process of the Department of Defense (DoD) contracting life cycle and has been operational since FY99.  DTRA is pursuing this in part to comply with language provided during the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to DOD to provide an electronic means to process invoices and vouchers for DOD related acquisitions and to provide a cost and time saving methodology to DTRA over the current paper process. Additionally, Public Law 106-398 requires that all vendors doing business with the Department of Defense (DoD) submit their invoices and supporting documentation electronically.  The Under Secretary of Defense identified Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) as the preferred system for meeting this statutory requirement.  Starting January 1, 2007 all new and any modified DTRA service contracts will contain the local WAWF electronic invoicing clause.  If your contract is awarded or modified after January 1st, 2007 you will need to submit your invoices/vouchers via the WAWF system.  Vendors are encouraged to visit the DTRA public webpage http://www.dtra.mil/be/business_opp/index.cfm for additional WAWF information and links to on-line training.  Vendors may also visit the following DFAS webpage for more detail WAWF information and to gain access to the WAWF Vendor Getting Started Guide available at: http://www.dod.mil/dfas/contractorpay/electroniccommerce/ECToolBox.html.   To take advantage of the benefits of WAWF, Vendors may call the WAWF Help Desk at 1-866-615-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil to establish their CAGE code in WAWF.  Vendors may self-register to use the system at:  https://wawf.eb.mil.

<SUBJECT>48--DTRA WAWF Implementation
<DESC>Defense Threat Reduction Agency --- Implements the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) process for electronic invoicing --- November 1, 2006.  On November 1, 2006, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) began implementing the Department of Defense (DOD) approved electronic invoicing process known as the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).  The WAWF process allows DTRA vendors an electronic means for submitting their payment requests and allows DTRA personnel a means to receive and accept these requests.  WAWF is a secure Web-based system that began as a Paperless Contracting prototype application to eliminate paper from the Receipt/Acceptance and Invoice/Payment process of the Department of Defense (DoD) contracting life cycle and has been operational since FY99.  DTRA is pursuing this in part to comply with language provided during the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to DOD to provide an electronic means to process invoices and vouchers for DOD related acquisitions and to provide a cost and time saving methodology to DTRA over the current paper process. Additionally, Public Law 106-398 requires that all vendors doing business with the Department of Defense (DoD) submit their invoices and supporting documentation electronically.  The Under Secretary of Defense identified Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) as the preferred system for meeting this statutory requirement.  Starting January 1, 2007 all new and any modified DTRA service contracts will contain the local WAWF electronic invoicing clause.  If your contract is awarded or modified after January 1st, 2007 you will need to submit your invoices/vouchers via the WAWF system.  Vendors are encouraged to visit the DTRA public webpage http://www.dtra.mil/be/business_opp/index.cfm for additional WAWF information and links to on-line training.  Vendors may also visit the following DFAS webpage for more detail WAWF information and to gain access to the WAWF Vendor Getting Started Guide available at: http://www.dod.mil/dfas/contractorpay/electroniccommerce/ECToolBox.html.

DTRA is pursuing this in part to comply with language provided during the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to DOD to provide an electronic means to process invoices and vouchers for DOD related acquisitions and to provide a cost and time saving methodology to DTRA over the current paper process. Additionally, Public Law 106-398 requires that all vendors doing business with the Department of Defense (DoD) submit their invoices and supporting documentation electronically.  The Under Secretary of Defense identified Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) as the preferred system for meeting this statutory requirement.  Starting January 1, 2007 all new and any modified DTRA service contracts will contain the local WAWF electronic invoicing clause.  If your contract is awarded or modified after January 1st, 2007 you will need to submit your invoices/vouchers via the WAWF system.

<SUBJECT>70--DTRA WAWF Implementation
<DESC>Defense Threat Reduction Agency --- Implements the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) process for electronic invoicing --- November 1, 2006.  On November 1, 2006, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) began implementing the Department of Defense (DOD) approved electronic invoicing process known as the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).  The WAWF process allows DTRA vendors an electronic means for submitting their payment requests and allows DTRA personnel a means to receive and accept these requests.  WAWF is a secure Web-based system that began as a Paperless Contracting prototype application to eliminate paper from the Receipt/Acceptance and Invoice/Payment process of the Department of Defense (DoD) contracting life cycle and has been operational since FY99.  DTRA is pursuing this in part to comply with language provided during the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to DOD to provide an electronic means to process invoices and vouchers for DOD related acquisitions and to provide a cost and time saving methodology to DTRA over the current paper process. Additionally, Public Law 106-398 requires that all vendors doing business with the Department of Defense (DoD) submit their invoices and supporting documentation electronically.  The Under Secretary of Defense identified Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) as the preferred system for meeting this statutory requirement.  Starting January 1, 2007 all new and any modified DTRA service contracts will contain the local WAWF electronic invoicing clause.  If your contract is awarded or modified after January 1st, 2007 you will need to submit your invoices/vouchers via the WAWF system.  Vendors are encouraged to visit the DTRA public webpage http://www.dtra.mil/be/business_opp/index.cfm for additional WAWF information and links to on-line training.  Vendors may also visit the following DFAS webpage for more detail WAWF information and to gain access to the WAWF Vendor Getting Started Guide available at: http://www.dod.mil/dfas/contractorpay/electroniccommerce/ECToolBox.html.   To take advantage of the benefits of WAWF, Vendors may call the WAWF Help Desk at 1-866-615-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil to establish their CAGE code in WAWF.  Vendors may self-register to use the system at:  https://wawf.eb.mil.

<SUBJECT>93--DTRA WAWF Implementation
<DESC>Defense Threat Reduction Agency --- Implements the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) process for electronic invoicing --- November 1, 2006.  On November 1, 2006, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) began implementing the Department of Defense (DOD) approved electronic invoicing process known as the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).  The WAWF process allows DTRA vendors an electronic means for submitting their payment requests and allows DTRA personnel a means to receive and accept these requests.  WAWF is a secure Web-based system that began as a Paperless Contracting prototype application to eliminate paper from the Receipt/Acceptance and Invoice/Payment process of the Department of Defense (DoD) contracting life cycle and has been operational since FY99.  DTRA is pursuing this in part to comply with language provided during the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to DOD to provide an electronic means to process invoices and vouchers for DOD related acquisitions and to provide a cost and time saving methodology to DTRA over the current paper process. Additionally, Public Law 106-398 requires that all vendors doing business with the Department of Defense (DoD) submit their invoices and supporting documentation electronically.  The Under Secretary of Defense identified Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) as the preferred system for meeting this statutory requirement.  Starting January 1, 2007 all new and any modified DTRA service contracts will contain the local WAWF electronic invoicing clause.  If your contract is awarded or modified after January 1st, 2007 you will need to submit your invoices/vouchers via the WAWF system.  Vendors are encouraged to visit the DTRA public webpage http://www.dtra.mil/be/business_opp/index.cfm for additional WAWF information and links to on-line training.  Vendors may also visit the following DFAS webpage for more detail WAWF information and to gain access to the WAWF Vendor Getting Started Guide available at: http://www.dod.mil/dfas/contractorpay/electroniccommerce/ECToolBox.html.   To take advantage of the benefits of WAWF, Vendors may call the WAWF Help Desk at 1-866-615-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil to establish their CAGE code in WAWF.  Vendors may self-register to use the system at:  https://wawf.eb.mil.

<SUBJECT>F--DTRA WAWF Implementation
<DESC>Defense Threat Reduction Agency --- Implements the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) process for electronic invoicing --- November 1, 2006.  On November 1, 2006, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) began implementing the Department of Defense (DOD) approved electronic invoicing process known as the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).  The WAWF process allows DTRA vendors an electronic means for submitting their payment requests and allows DTRA personnel a means to receive and accept these requests.  WAWF is a secure Web-based system that began as a Paperless Contracting prototype application to eliminate paper from the Receipt/Acceptance and Invoice/Payment process of the Department of Defense (DoD) contracting life cycle and has been operational since FY99.  DTRA is pursuing this in part to comply with language provided during the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to DOD to provide an electronic means to process invoices and vouchers for DOD related acquisitions and to provide a cost and time saving methodology to DTRA over the current paper process. Additionally, Public Law 106-398 requires that all vendors doing business with the Department of Defense (DoD) submit their invoices and supporting documentation electronically.  The Under Secretary of Defense identified Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) as the preferred system for meeting this statutory requirement.  Starting January 1, 2007 all new and any modified DTRA service contracts will contain the local WAWF electronic invoicing clause.  If your contract is awarded or modified after January 1st, 2007 you will need to submit your invoices/vouchers via the WAWF system.

On November 1, 2006, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) began implementing the Department of Defense (DOD) approved electronic invoicing process known as the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).  The WAWF process allows DTRA vendors an electronic means for submitting their payment requests and allows DTRA personnel a means to receive and accept these requests.  WAWF is a secure Web-based system that began as a Paperless Contracting prototype application to eliminate paper from the Receipt/Acceptance and Invoice/Payment process of the Department of Defense (DoD) contracting life cycle and has been operational since FY99.  DTRA is pursuing this in part to comply with language provided during the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to DOD to provide an electronic means to process invoices and vouchers for DOD related acquisitions and to provide a cost and time saving methodology to DTRA over the current paper process. Additionally, Public Law 106-398 requires that all vendors doing business with the Department of Defense (DoD) submit their invoices and supporting documentation electronically.  The Under Secretary of Defense identified Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) as the preferred system for meeting this statutory requirement.  Starting January 1, 2007 all new and any modified DTRA service contracts will contain the local WAWF electronic invoicing clause.  If your contract is awarded or modified after January 1st, 2007 you will need to submit your invoices/vouchers via the WAWF system.  Vendors are encouraged to visit the DTRA public webpage http://www.dtra.mil/be/business_opp/index.cfm for additional WAWF information and links to on-line training.  Vendors may also visit the following DFAS webpage for more detail WAWF information and to gain access to the WAWF Vendor Getting Started Guide available at: http://www.dod.mil/dfas/contractorpay/electroniccommerce/ECToolBox.html.   To take advantage of the benefits of WAWF, Vendors may call the WAWF Help Desk at 1-866-615-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil to establish their CAGE code in WAWF.  Vendors may self-register to use the system at:  https://wawf.eb.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- Extention of Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL THERAPIES
<DESC>Extention of Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration

MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL THERAPIES 
FOR PATIENTS WITH WELL CHARACTERIZED GASTROPARESIS

The deadline for submitting capability statements in response to this notice has been extended to February 15, 2007.

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks collaborations with industry to provide novel agents and devices for randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials of novel therapies for the treatment of patients with well-characterized gastroparesis.  

Gastroparesis is a clinical syndrome characterized by multiple symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, and early satiety.  Physiological studies are characterized by delayed emptying of the stomach.  There are multiple etiologies, such as diabetes and surgical injury to the vagus nerve, but the most common etiological category is idiopathic.

INTRODUCTION:  The Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC) will conduct multicenter clinical research studies of patients with gastroparesis using defined clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions and will collect samples that may be useful for ancillary studies of etiology and pathogenesis. 

A prospective Gastroparesis Registry of patients with diabetic, idiopathic, and post-surgical gastroparesis was created by the newly formulated NIDDK-funded Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC) that will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of approximately 1,000 patients for 3 years on average.  In addition to collecting clinical patient data, Registry patients will submit serum and DNA samples.  Thus, ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathophysiology, diagnosis, imaging studies, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, and determinants of progression and severity of gastroparesis also pose collaborative opportunities.

STUDY GOALS:  The GpCRC principal investigators wish to consider potential new diagnostics and therapeutics for patients with gastroparesis.  The overall goal of the GpCRC is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with gastroparesis using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of gastroparesis and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by using the Gastroparesis Registry which includes clinical information as well as serum and DNA samples.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies that are interested in collaborating with GpCRC by providing novel therapeutic agents or devices for randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials of novel therapies, which could include: (1) prokinetic agents such as dopamine D-2 receptor antagonists, motilin receptor agonists, serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT4) receptor agonists, or cholecystokinin receptor antagonists versus placebo; (2) tricyclic antidepressant and related agents such as selective serotonin or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors versus placebo; (3) botulinum toxin injection versus placebo; (4) antiemetic agents such as aprepitant or serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) inhibitors such as palonosetron versus placebo; (5) novel analgesic agents such as pregabalin or gabapentin or derivatives of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) versus placebo; (6) gastric electrical stimulation or other devices versus placebo; and (7) complementary therapies such as herbal medicine, acupressure and electrical acustimulation, or acupuncture versus placebo in patients with well characterized gastroparesis.

The NIDDK is also seeking capability statements from companies for ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathophysiology, diagnosis, imaging studies, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, and determinants of progression and severity of gastroparesis.  Examples of potential ancillary studies include:  1) Exploration of serum markers for gastroparesis and serum markers for disease activity to predict gastric histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical, laboratory, proteomic, and metabolomic variables in the Gastroparesis Registry;  2) Exploration of the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in gastroparesis treatment trials;  3) Development of serum proteomic, metabolomic, and genomic expression arrays that are diagnostic of gastroparesis and that would provide surrogates for symptom severity as well as insights into the pathophysiology of this disease; and 4) Evaluation of the role of noninvasive imaging methods for assessing disease activity in gastroparesis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories.  They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services.  The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator.  Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort.  The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration.  The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.  Examples of the Clinical Trial Agreement and the CRADA can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  The Steering Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Steering Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages of narrative and should address the following selection criteria:  

1.	The proposed preparation must have been tested in Phase I trials in humans.
2.

3.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the laboratory test agents in a timely manner for the duration of the study.  
4.	A description of laboratory tests that are needed including assays and required amount of specimens, to determine specific biomarker levels along with appropriate methods for performing.
5.	A description of other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  
6.	A description of the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.
7.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment and evaluation of gastroparesis, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development.  
8.	If appropriate, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research.
9.	Must agree to have their preparation used in the above-mentioned GpCRC-developed protocols which will be conducted by GpCRC and will have data collection and analysis performed by the GpCRC Data Coordinating Center.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15.  This solicitation is a 100% set-aside for Small Business.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to acquire a Trauma Physiologist to perform research for Resuscitative fluid therapy for combined head injury and hemorrhage at the Walter Reed Institute of Research (WRAIR), Wash ington, D.C.  Contract performance period shall be one year from date of award with 1-one year option period and a second option period of eight months.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format i n Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for proposal (RFP) an d the solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are thus in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 90-46.  The Statement of Work is as follows:  Traumatic brain injury is one of the most prevalent causes of death among combat casualties, and the morbidity and mortality resulting from head injury is greatly exacerbated by accompanying hypotension due to hemorrhage. Rodent preclinical models of fluid  percussion-induced traumatic brain injury and isobaric hemorrhagic hypotension are combined to study pathophysiological mechanisms unique to this large subpopulation of patients and to elvaluate novel resuscitative interventions targeting these mediators.  These experimental evaluations employ acute manipulation and measurements of cardiovascular function and systemic metabolic status, along with longer-term assessments of behavioral and neuropathological outcome. OBJECTIVE An individual with an advanced de gree (e.g. Ph.D.), post-doctoral training in physiology and/or neuroscience, and extensive hands-on experience with rodent surgery and physiological monitoring techniques will conduct experiments with laboratory rats that are designed to gain insights into  the far-forward care of combat casualties with head injury and  hemorrhagic hypotension. Evaluations of outcomnes and associated physiological parameters in these preclinical experiments will serve to identify treatment strategies suited for military medical operations. Experiments will be conducted using fluid percuss ion-induced brain injury and/or isobaric hemorrhagic hypotension. Experiments will address how blood loss worsens the brain's pathophysiological responses to trauma, and will evaluate the possible  role of disrupted systelnic metabolic status in the pathophysiology of these combined injuries. These data will be compiled and analyzed and will provide insights critical to USAMRMC combat casualty care research. SPECIFIC TASKS:  The following tasks shall be performed independent of Government supervision, direction or control: 	Performs and/or oversees duties associated with the surgical preparation, physiological monitoring. and behavioral training and testing of animal subjects.  Surgical tasks will include stereotaxic surgery (craniotomy) and blood vessel cannulation (femoral artery, femoral vein and tail artery). The incumbent must also be capable of handling and caring for laboratory rats, using rodent test equipment, and writi ng and executing laboratory computer, data analysis, and graphic display software. Rodent handling and care, data analysis and transfer, and graphic display of data will be required on a daily basis. Serving as an independent investigator, the incumbent wi ll also be responsible for the routine maintenance and utilization of the instrumentation required for monitoring cardiovascular (e.g. arterial pressure and heart rate), metabolic (e.g. O2 consumption, CO2 production, heat production), and brain injury sta tus (e.g. laser Doppler flowmetry, cerebral oxygen tension) and the execution of experiments using these data collection techniques. Designs and coordinates experiments, provides guidance and assistance to coworkers and  collaborators, and answers questions a bout experimental objectives and techniques to be used to fulfill these objectives. Recommends equipment acquisitions appropriate for experimental procedures and lnaintains a laboratory inventory of chemical reagents and surgical supplies required for thes e tasks. Conducts experiments at an average completion rate of 10 experimental subjects per month. Deviations from this rate due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g. equipment malfunction, animal illnesses) will be immediately brought to the attention of the COR and necessary adjustments will be made. Compiles, analyzes, and interprets data. Prepares or contributes to the summary of experimental findings for presentation at scientific meetings, in reports, and in scientific journals. When each treatment group contains 10 experimental subjects, data will be compiled, statistically analyzed, and summarized. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: Monthly Report. In addition to providing all collected data to the COR, the contractor shall prepare and deliver written monthly progr ess reports and will submit them no later than the 15th of each month. Final Technical Comprehensive Report.

We can fulfill all services except for the geotechnical engineering and hazmat engineering services, which we could provide with sub-consultants, but we would prefer not to have sub-consultants if at all possible so that we are not subject to MBE/WBE/DBE requirements.

<DESC>Item descriptions 1 and 2 are amended to include the following requirements:  WEIGHT OF MESH MATERIAL SHALL BE BETWEEN 6-12 OUNCES PER SQUARE YARD.  VINYL TEX OR EQUAL BACKING. BACKING SHALL BE GRAY OR BLACK COLOR.

REVISED ITEM DESCRIPTION 1:  RB-HS SET OF 3 COVERS (REFERENCE RB-HS DRAWING FOR SIZES) 105 SETS, MESH COVERS, COLOR LIGHT GRAY, MARINE QUALITY POLYESTER OR VINYL MESH WITH FLAME RETARDANT AND UV INHIBITORS, MESH MATERIAL SHALL BE POROUS WITH A THREAD COUNT BETWEEN (9-13) X (12-16) PER SQUARE INCH, WEIGHT SHALL BE BETWEEN 6-12 OUNCES PER SQUARE YARD, AREA BETWEEN STRANDS SHALL BE 40 PERCENT OR GREATER, HALF INCH HEM WITH VINYL TEX OR EQUAL BACKING.

REVISED ITEM DESCRIPTION 2: RB-S SET OF 6 COVERS (REFERENCE RB-S DRAWING FOR SIZES) 400 SETS, MESH COVERS, COLOR LIGHT GRAY, MARINE QUALITY POLYESTER OR VINYL MESH WITH FLAME RETARDANT AND UV INHIBITORS., MESH MATERIAL SHALL BE POROUS WITH A THREAD COUNT BETWEEN (9-13) X (12-16) PER SQUARE INCH, WEIGHT SHALL BE BETWEEN 6-12 OUNCES PER SQUARE YARD, AREA BETWEEN STRANDS SHALL BE 40 PERCENT OR GREATER, HALF INCH HEM WITH VINYL TEX OR EQUAL BACKING.

The following answers are provided in response to questions:

1.  The reference to the 1-1/2 inch vinyl tex backing.  Putting a backing on a cover like this is very common, it reinforces the holding of the snaps.  Normally we use an 1-1/2 inch poly pro webbing.  I called several suppliers and no one was aware of any product called vinyl tex.  Answer:  Poly pro webbing meets the vinyl tex or equal backing requirement per item descriptions 1 and 2.

2.  We would appreciate it if you could clarify the weight of the mesh.  The specifications mention that the mesh needs to have a minimum 8 oz per square yard polyester mesh; however, the specifications later say that the weight of the mesh must be between 6-12 ounces per square yard.  We would appreciate it if you could let us know what the difference in the two different weights is.  What weight specification is required?  Answer:  The weight of the mesh shall be between 6-12 ounces per square yard.  Reference item description changes made in this Amendment.

3.  What specific Flame Retardant standard/certification does the mesh need to meet?  Answer:  There is no specific flame retardant standard/certification requirement.  The level of flame retardant provided shall comply with Industry Standards for the mesh material.  

4.  Regarding item description, it states half inch hem with vinyl tex backing.  I understand this to be for reinforcement purpose and recommend Mil Spec Herculite (vinyl laminated).  Answer:  Mil Spec Herculite meets the vinyl tex or equal backing requirement per item descriptions 1 and 2.  

5.  If I am reading the solicitation correctly then we will send one set each as samples.  For the remaining numbers, I am reading that each set must be individually packaged to facilitate easy shipping from the USCG warehouse. Am I reading this correctly?  Answer:  Yes, that is correct regarding both the samples, and packaging for remaining sets.

6.  What is Vinyl Tex Backing?  Answer:  Provide backing normally used with polyester or vinyl mesh.

7.  Does the Vinyl Tex Backing need to be Flame Retardant?  If so, what specific Flame Retardant specification/standard does it need to meet?  Answer:  No.

8.  What is the required weight of the Vinyl Tex Backing?  Answer:  No required weight but should be suitable for mesh material weight.

9.  What is the required color of the Vinyl Tex Backing?  Answer:  Gray or black.
