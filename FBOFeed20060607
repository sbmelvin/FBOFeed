<SUBJECT>R--Veterinary pathologist - desert tortoises.
<SOLNBR>06WRSS0012
<RESPDATE>062206
<ARCHDATE>06072007
<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Resources Discipline, Western Ecological Research Center, Box Springs Field Station (USGS) has identified a requirement for a qualified veterinary pathologist capable of performing necropsies on desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii). This will be a negotiated acquisition in accordance with (IAW) the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.  Full and open competition will be provided for.  This acquisition is unrestricted, under NAICS code 541940 - Veterinary Services.  The USGS desires a five year contract period, which will likely consist of a base year and four option years. A brief description of the required services follows. General Background Research has been underway since the 1970's to determine causes of illness and death in desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) from the Southwest.  New and emerging diseases appear to be contributors to decline in wild desert tortoise populations.  On April 2, 1990, the federal government of the United States listed desert tortoise populations north and west of the Colorado River as threatened.  Since 1989, the Principal Investigator (PI, U.S. Geological Survey), and scientists at other government institutions, have used a combination of data from clinical observations in the field and necropsies to conduct research on diseases suspected of causing population declines in wild desert tortoises.  Over six dozen tortoises, collected between 1989 and 2005, have been the subject of this ongoing study.  Most tortoises were discovered ill, dying, or recently dead in the field.  In a few cases, the tortoises were apparently healthy, but were killed by vehicles; their organ systems provided baseline information on topics such as concentrations of metals and organic compounds. Diseases that have been identified as the cause of illness or death include but are not limited to: cutaneous dyskeratosis; shell necrosis; cutaneous mycotic infection; malnutrition/dehydration; pneumonia; mycoplasmosis; intracoelomic ectopic egg retention; elevated tissue concentrations of cadmium, lead and iron, and other potentially toxic elements; and trauma and urolithasis. Objectives There is a continuing need to monitor the routine health monitoring of tortoise populations by performing complete necropsies on ill, dying and recently dead tortoises.  These routine necropsies provide valuable baseline data for the various populations.  The data and publications from the necropsied tortoises have contributed to a better understanding of how the desert tortoise responds to a variety of disease conditions.  The overall goal of this project is to determine the actual and potential causes of illness or death by gross and microscopic examination of tissues and by conducting hematological, plasma biochemical, and other laboratory tests. Using FY06 research funds and future funds as they become available, we propose a variety of research objectives which include, but are not limited to: (1)	perform necropsies on ill, dying, and recently dead wild desert tortoises from all parts of the geographic range within the United States, with a focus on California; (2)	establish a reference collection of laboratory data, including histologic studies and photographs of lesions, on relevant organ systems for both healthy and diseases tortoises; (3)	determine actual and potential causes of the illness or death using standardized techniques of research veterinarians, pathologists, and microbiologists, as well as new techniques where appropriate; (4)	continue ongoing research on the cause of shell diseases; (5)	determine the concentrations of heavy metals, other potentially toxic elements, organic compounds, and other potentially toxic substances in tortoise tissues; (6)	provide support for ongoing research on epidemiology of mycoplasmosis by identifying tortoises that are infected with Mycoplasma sp. and/or have lesions of mycoplasmosis, and identifying the species of Mycoplasma isolated from respiratory or genital tract; or other organs; (7)	continue support and research on herpes virus infections by identifying tortoises that are infected with herpes virus and the organ system involved; (8)	visit specific field sites, when requested, to respond to new critical situations; (9)	collaborate with other scientists on the health/disease research project; and  (10)	in collaboration with the PI, USGS, prepare interim and final reports and publications for the peer-reviewed research veterinary medical journals (open literature) that will summarize the methods, results, and general findings of necropsies and on specific subjects.  Such reports and journal articles will be done in collaboration with other scientists on the health/disease research project. The timing and achievement of these objectives are partially dependent on getting adequate numbers of tortoise with different kinds of diseases.  The PI, USGS, will be providing the tortoises and shall manage all the required permits. The objectives and comparative weight of the tasks required to achieve the objectives will be reevaluated on the quarterly basis.  Objectives are aimed at providing valuable information that research workers can utilize and build upon for investigations into the ecological and medical management of desert tortoises, particularly tortoises with different diseases such as herpes virus, mycoplasmosis, and cutaneous dyskeratosis. Complete specifications will be provided with the Request for Proposals, which is anticipated for release on or about 26 June 2006. For further information regarding this announcement, please contact Jeff Caravelli, Contracting Officer, at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov.  Numbered note 26 applies.

<SUBJECT>99--ADS-B NAS Wide Acquisition  - Industry Day Announcement - JRC Approval
<SOLNBR>4854
<RESPDATE>061606
<ARCHDATE>07162006
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676
<DESC>On April 6, 2006, the FAA posted a public announcement advising industry that the FAA intends to develop a NAS wide acquisition program for Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B), and Flight Information Service - Broadcast (FIS-B) services with a goal of an "in-service" decision by 2010. A second announcement was posted on May 16, 2006.  This announcement requested Patent information and stated that an industry day was planned after approval of the program by the FAA Joint Resources Council.  The FAA JRC approved the NAS wide program today, June 7, 2006.   Accordingly, an Industry Day is planned for June 19, 2006 where the overall program will be discussed.  In addition, it is planned to conduct individualized discussions with vendors starting June 20, 2006.  All interested vendors are invited to participate irrespective of prior responses to FAA ADS-B announcements.       The event will be held at FAA Headquarters in the Bessie Coleman Conference Room located on the second floor.  The planned starting time is 8:30 A.M.   The address is: 800 Independence Avenue S.W.  Washington, D.C. 20591 Vendors planning to participate in Industry Day activities should make reservations with:   Ms Amy Durik  Communications Lead  202-385-8394 Desk   E-Mail:  Amy CTR Durik/AWA/CNTR/FAA Individual vendor discussions may be scheduled with Ms. Durik on a 1 Â½ hour basis starting at 8:30 A.M June 20th.   FAA is considering allowing vendors to speak on June 19 with the understanding that FAA is not endorsing or sponsoring any vendor.  Since this stage of the acquisition represents an exchange of information and not a down-select process, a vendor's choice whether to request a presentation and/or to hold an individual discussion will have no bearing on eligibility to submit a proposal and will have no impact on future evaluation determinations.     Vendors interested in providing not to exceed 20 minute presentations should contact Ms. Durik.  Depending on the number of responses, the FAA retains the option to select a subset of vendors for presentations, to limit presentation times, or chose to have no vendor presentations.   Vendors should indicate to Ms. Durik any equipment needs to support presentations.   The FAA has received significant vendor input regarding the structure of the program.  FAA will continue to encourage the maximum exchange of information.   The May 16, 2006 public announcement also requested patent information which would be published to foster industry communications and potential teaming arrangements.    The FAA has not researched the information received and does not substantiate that the information provided is accurate or complete.   The following patent responses were received: ADSI, Inc.  1.  U.

<DESC>In response to an operational need and an aging fleet of light tactical wheeled vehicles, the Joint Services have developed a requirement for a family of new tactical wheeled vehicles.   This vehicle will provide increased force protection, survivability, and improved capacity over the current up-armored High Mobility Multi Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) while balancing mobility and transportability requirements with total ownership costs.  The collection of variants is known as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) Family of Vehicles.  The five (5) Mission Role Vehicles (i.e. common platform(s) configured to perform a particular mission) are defined as follows:  1) Combat Tactical Variant  2) Command and Control Variant 3) Utility Variant 4) Light Infantry Squad Carrier Variant and 5) Reconnaissance Variant and shall also include compatible trailers.  These 5 Mission Role Vehicles track to the 5 task oriented gaps in current joint service light tactical mobility that have been identified through JCIDS analysis:  (1) Move mounted infantry/combat arms forces; (2) Move mounted Combat Service forces; (3) Move mounted Combat Service Support forces; (4) Move Light Infantry (Airborne/Air Assault) and (5) Move reconnaissance forces undetected.

The JLTV and other future military vehicles will be designed with basic organic armor protection (“A” kit) but must also accommodate an add-on armor protection system (“B” kit) that may be installed by the vehicle occupants.  Since these vehicles will be required to accommodate a substantial payload, their Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) can vary substantially from the “A” kit, unloaded condition, to the “B” kit, fully loaded condition.  This can cause undesirable effects on unladen vehicle ride quality and undesirable changes in body height.  Additionally, challenging ship and aircraft transportability interface requirements and the desire to raise the vehicle for blast mitigation may necessitate a variable body height.  Lastly, there is a need to mitigate rollover accidents which may necessitate built-in stability control systems.  

The lack of flexibility in the ride height suspension on military vehicles is a persistent issue with many vehicle types.  The research and development desired is expected to raise the performance levels and adjustability of suspension systems in multiple future vehicle designs.  It is anticipated that much of the technology to be captured from this effort can first be refined through use in the JLTV program.

This vehicle will provide increased force protection, survivability, and improved capacity over the current up-armored High Mobility Multi Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) while balancing mobility and transportability requirements with total ownership costs.  

The collection of mission role variants based on one or more common vehicle platforms is known as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) Family of Vehicles.  The five (5) Mission Role Vehicles (i.e., common platform(s) configured to perform a particular mission) are defined as follows:  1) Combat Tactical Variant  2) Command and Control Variant 3) Utility Variant 4) Light Infantry Squad Carrier Variant and 5) Reconnaissance Variant.

The JLTV and other future military vehicles will be designed with basic organic armor protection (“A” kit) but must also accommodate an add-on armor protection system (“B” kit) that may be installed by the vehicle occupants.  This approach has significant implications for the design of the vehicle.  The propulsion and suspension systems must be capable of providing adequate mobility performance under widely varying vehicle load conditions.  The body structure must be strong and rigid enough to securely attach heavy armor panels & ballistic glass, yet light enough for air transport.    The braking system must be sized for the maximum anticipated Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW), yet still be capable of functioning properly when the vehicle is lightly loaded.  Vehicle dimensions and weight have a very significant effect on transportability aboard ships and aircraft.  The JLTV family of vehicles must be designed to be network enabled and provide capability to organically power all of the on-board electronic components, both with the engine on and in extended silent watch, as well as export power to outside systems.  

Simultaneously satisfying these and other design issues, and making this an affordable family of vehicles, will require innovative and novel technologies and strategies and the judicious use of advanced technology informed by a measured decision-making process.  

These science and technology efforts are not related to a specific program of record or hardware procurement but will be used to advance the state-of-the-art and increase our knowledge base relative to the trades and technologies being developed.  The results from these efforts will be used to support an envisioned phased joint service program and help define a common set of vehicle requirements.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is seeking information from industry relating to technologies and approaches for the automated conversion (to the highest degree practical) of BLS statistical information, represented in XML, to Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested vendors who believe they are able to satisfy the requirements detailed in the description below.  BLS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this request.  This RFI is being issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  The information contained in this RFI is based on the best and most current information available to date, is subject to change, and is not binding on the Government.  Below is background information and description of the requirements for the XML to PDF conversion.

Background
The BLS is the principal fact-finding agency for the Federal Government in the broad field of labor economics and statistics. The BLS is an independent national statistical agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates essential statistical data to the American public, the U.S. Congress, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, business, and labor. 

The BLS provides its data to the public in a variety of formats including digital formats (such as web pages on the Internet, e.g.  http://stats.bls.gov)  and printed formats (e.g. http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf ).  

BLS data, either in print or electronic form, is often presented as tables of statistical data.  Formatting statistical data tables for print is more difficult than formatting them for presentation in, for example, HTML because printed output is constrained by the fixed size of a standard printed page. Currently, BLS requires substantial manual manipulation of tabular data for printed output to ensure that tables, and to a lesser degree, text and graphics are displayed in a sensible and readable fashion.   (See Requirements and Constraints section below for more detail on issues related to displaying statistical tables in print).

Currently, BLS extracts tabular data from a database in the form of an XML dataset, which is transformed into XHTML for display on the Bureau’s web site.  This RFI is for investigation of the feasibility of transforming the XML dataset into PDF for use as a camera-ready output.  The transformation should be accomplished with a minimum of manual intervention.  


Requirements and Constraints
•	The goal is to convert XML data sets to camera ready PDF files for printed distribution.
•	The source XML datasets specify content and structure.  As such they do not, and should not, contain presentation information. 
•	Style sheets containing presentation information do not currently exist.
•	The desired solution will be as highly automated, and will require as little manual intervention, as possible.
•	It is highly desirable that the solution be implemented in Java in order to make it more compatible with the current environment.
•	The camera ready copy (PDF) will be in black and white and contain statistical tables of varying length, text, graphics, header and footer information, footnotes and may contain multiple fonts.
•	The layout of the statistical tables must support multiple levels of nested column headings, spanned across columns, and multiple levels of nested row headings, indicated through indentation.
•	Statistical tables will vary in length, and some will extend over multiple pages. Long tables will need to be broken across page boundaries at appropriate places, with the position of page breaks to be automatically determined by the software.  Column header information and footnotes should be repeated on new pages when tables span multiple pages.   
•	Statistical tables will have a varying number of columns. The default size of each column must be automatically determined by its contents, with the possibility of design-time overrides of the defaults.
•	Columns containing numeric data must be wide enough to display the data and associated footnotes on one line (subject to the constraints of page width.)
•	Columns and headers containing text should be hyphenated as needed to fit within the boundaries of the cell. 
•	Table layouts must support decimal-point alignment when specified for a particular column.


Hardware Platform and operating system Requirements
We seek a solution using Java that can easily be integrated into our current Java/Solaris environment.  Other approaches will be considered if an acceptable Java and Solaris solution can not be identified.   

Other Requirements
The vendors must provide a statement of how the applicable Federal 508 requirements are addressed.

The solution must be capable of running in an IPv6 environment, or documented plans must exist for a timetable for implementation of any necessary enhancements required for proper functionality in an IPv6 environment.

All software (and hardware if applicable) will be evaluated in a simulated BLS computing environment to determine that the solution meets the functional and system requirements set forth in this document as well as BLS security, networking, and usage guidelines applicable to software and hardware permitted to run in the BLS computing environment.   

Respondents are requested to offer comments regarding the requirements as stated above, level of detail, completeness, consistency with industry best practices, suitability for achieving stated objectives, any areas that have been left out and should be considered, potential cost of the system and whether or not the items are available for purchase off the GSA schedule.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  BLS reserves the right to conduct oral capabilities demonstrations/discussions that may be scheduled at a later date.

<DESC>1. The 15 Contracting Squadron/LGCZ has the requirement to obtain support services for the Kenney Headquarters (KHQ)Pacific Air Operations Center (PAOC)Air Mobility Division (AMD). This is a recompetition of the former Air Mobility Operations Control Center (AMOCC) contract.  The Kenney Headquarters Pacific Air Operations Center (PAOC) Air Mobility Division (AMD) is Commander PACAF’s executive agent primarily responsible for Command and Control of PACAF and other (as specified) air mobility aircraft operating within the USPACOM AOR – both in peacetime and in crisis.  The PAOC AMD operates twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, including weekends and holidays. On a steady-state basis, the PAOC AMD oversees a variety of air mobility missions operating within an ever-changing scenario of theater environments, exercises, and day-to-day operations.  Primary AMD functions include planning, tasking, scheduling, coordinating, flight following, dispatching, and recovering PACAF assigned and gained air mobility aircraft.  In a theater crisis, the PAOC AMD continues to support steady-state operations while simultaneously mobilizing select ‘core’ AMD functionalities to focus on the urgency at-hand.  In such instances, the AMD integrates with global air mobility systems to enable a rapid and responsive transition from peacetime to contingency operations to efficiently and effectively accomplish the AMD mission in providing seamless global mobility.   

In addition to a small government contingent consisting of the AMD Chief, AMD Deputy, Senior Directors, Quality Assurance Personnel, Airlift Requirements, the Pacific Military Altitude Reservation Facility (PACMARF), and Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Cell personnel, the PAOC AMD is predominately made up of contract mission managers, dispatchers, airlift and tanker planners, operational support airlift schedulers, DV planners, logisticians, and internal staff support. 

A Statement of Work was posted on FedBizOps earlier. The NAICS code being used is 488190.  The RFP is scheduled to be issued NLT 16 Jun 06 with a closing date of 14 Jul 06.  Oral Presentations are estimated to begin about 19 Jul 06.

<DESC>The Air Force Seek Eagle Office (AFSEO) is planning to contract on a sole source basis with Advanced Electromagnetics, 4516 Stockbridge Ave, NW, Albuquerque, NM, 87120-5406, to procure services that will allow the modification of the GEMACS (General Electromagnetic Model for the Analysis of Complex Systems) and CEM Framework to accommodate their use on large clusters of networked computer systems.  The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office’s (AFSEO) currently uses GEMACS, as one of their primary codes for Computational Electromagnetics (CEM).  Pre- and post-processing of data is done through the use of the proprietary code “CEM Framework”, a computational electromagnetic software environment developed through a Small Business Innovation Research effort.  The Method of Moments (MoM) computational algorithms and the necessary overhead routines in GEMACS have been modified to utilize clusters of computers.  To realize the increased modeling and simulation potential afforded by large numbers of computer processors in parallel and shared memory resources, this effort will require making modifications and upgrades to GEMACS in two areas: 1) modify the algorithms for Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD), Finite Difference Frequency Domain (FDFD), and Eigenvector/Eigenvalue (EV) to use the same parallel processing rules and methods enabling their use on clustered computers using Linux, and; 2) modify the hybrid algorithms of Mom, UTD, FDFD and EV to also operate in parallel modes on those machines.  In addition, modifications to CEM Framework will be necessary for pre- and post-processing data.  Interested parties may submit Statement of Capabilities (SOC) demonstrating their ability to perform the required effort.  All responses to this synopsis will be evaluated in the following areas:  1) Demonstrated technical knowledge of the AFSEO’s electromagnetic certification process; 2) Demonstrated technical knowledge in state of the art computational electromagnet methods; 3) Ability to modify the GEMACS code while maintaining its core capabilities; 4) Ability to modify the CEM Framework software environment while maintaining its core capabilities; 5) Ability to perform acceptance tests of the new capabilities in accordance with Contractor developed and Government approved plans; 6) Ability to maintain the integrity of all software through Government approved software configuration control methods, and avoiding unnecessary redevelopment efforts; and  7) Ability to meet the required delivery schedule.  Responders to this synopsis will not be provided the results of the government evaluation of their qualifying package.  This is a 30-month effort beginning approximately 1 October 2006.  The closing date for submission of qualifications is 25 July 2006.  Interested sources should contact Ms. Jewel Burgess, AAC/PKZ, 205 West D Avenue, Suite 468, Eglin AFB, FL 3254, (850) 882-0171 or Ouida Winters at (850) 882-0166.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE

The United States Government Printing Office (USGPO) will be soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis from qualified vendors, to establish a Government-located, Contractor-owned and operated facility to support the manufacturing, personalization, and issuance of electronically enabled, smart card-based, Government Identification Cards, to be located within a USGPO-owned facility in the Washington, DC area with a continuity of operations capabilities facility located elsewhere.  

As part of the USGPO mission and Strategic Vision to provide safe and secure design, production, distribution, and management of secure documents for the Federal Government, the USGPO will provide a trusted, secure supply chain from procurement and maintenance of electronic components and software through manufacturing, personalization, issuance and management of Federal smart card-based identity documents for the enhancement of the overall security of government identification credentials. The USGPO solution will provide Federal Agencies with an alternative to an in-house Identification Card personalization and issuance or use of a commercial outsource solution to better manage the risk, performance, and cost of implementing and issuing smart card Identification Cards.  The USGPO will enable economies of scale by centrally locating identification card manufacturing, personalization and issuance activities for the government. The USGPO intends to provide smartcard identification cards under Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) as well as smartcards for other Federal initiatives. In addition to the physical smartcard Identification Card, the USGPO also intends to offer other related products and services to Federal Agencies in all three branches of government.  The USGPO plans to provide Identification Cards (1) as the primary sponsor of turnkey solutions to Federal agencies and (2) as a backup source to other Federal agencies, providing additional capacity as well as supporting continuity of operations for agencies with existing card production, personalization, and PKI certification capabilities.  Additionally, the USGPO will provide the ancillary support services for HSPD-12, including Identification Management Systems, Enrollment and Issuance Services and Card Management Services. To achieve a rapid ramp-up of capability and capacity to meet the Federal Government mandated deadlines for the deployment of HSPD-12 smartcard-based identification cards, the USGPO anticipates the initial manufacturing, personalization and issuance of these products and related, ancillary services will be performed by the Contractor from within an existing Contractor-owned and operated facility.   The goal of the USGPO is to minimize this initial phase of operations and to work closely with the Contractor to identify, modify and renovate the final production operations center which will be located within a USGPO-owned facility.

A Draft Request for Proposals will be issued through www.FedBizOpps.gov and www.gpo.gov/bidopps/majoracquisitions.htm  in about 15 calendar days from today.  An estimated date of 30 June 2006 has been established for receipt of comments on the draft.  

Systems must meet the requirements of Federal Information Processing Standard 201-1 (FIPS 201-1), Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors; Special Publication 800-73-1 (SP 800-73-1); Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification; Special Publication 800-76 (SP 800-76), Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification; Special Publication 800-78 (SP 800-78), Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification; and Special Publication 800-79 (SP 800-79), Guidelines for the Certification and Accreditation of PIV Card Issuing Organizations, and be compliant with the principals and intent of  the Privacy Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), E-Government Act, OMB Policy M-03-22, OMB Circular A-130, Clinger-Cohen Act, and OMB Policy M-05-24.

<DESC>Dynamics Measurement Department, Code 6630, of the Carderock division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCCD) has been tasked to provide 94,000 feet of coaxial anti-micro phonic cable. It is required to be on 2000-foot continuous reels. In support of this effort, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to Times Microwave Systems. In previous purchases, cable was procured from other manufacturer but they were found to be inferior to Times Microwave, even though they said they could meet the specifications. Award to any other source would result in a substantial cost because we are currently using many measuring systems and hardware that uses Times cable and to keep future rigs and systems compatible, Time cable should be used. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Gov!  ernment. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 6/22/2006.

Any other company would require significantly more time (estimated at well over 50%) to perform this tasking due to the need to establish the contacts within the DoD and Navy that Sea L.C. already has established. Therefore, no other company is in the position to provide the required support. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity – Panama City, Receiving Officer, building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS CODE is 541611. Size Standard is $6M. PSC is AD20.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for C Image Generator systems for NASA Ames' Tower Simulator, FutureFlight Central (FCC). This procurement is for the delivery, integration and installation of image generation (IG) systems for FFC. The IG solution is based on Future Flight’s existing software, MaxSim by Adacel, Inc. and the Adacel IG visual standard. This standard makes use of commercial off the shelf computers, graphics cards, visual run-time software applications, and Adacel’s interface software, VMAX. The requirements and deliverables for the Future Flight Central Image Generation System are as follows:  Requirements: A.   Provide a 12 channel IG system replacement for FutureFlight Central’s existing SGI system for the Tower plus two additional IG channels for future independent eyepoint views; and a three channel IG system replacement for FutureFlight Central’s existing SGI system used for development;  B.  The IG system must support the existing MaxSim™ 2.8 based simulation, including, at a minimum,  all existing MaxSim 2.8 visual effects; C.  The IG system must be delivered, integrated, and tested at NASA Ames FutureFlight Central; D. The IG system must demonstrate the ability to display 200 moving aircraft models simultaneously in the scene; E. The IG system must sustain a refresh rate of 30 Hz while displaying up to 100,000 polygons of all moving models. Deliverables: A. Fourteen (14) PC based IGs (Dell Precision WS380 3G 800 2G RAM, running XPP and with video card: ASUS N7800GT 512M, or equivalent), to support the primary display system.   Any deviation from the specified equipment must be approved by NASA;  B. One (1) VMAX Display System License for the primary display system; C. Three (3) PC based IGs (Dell Precision WS380 3G 800 2G RAM, running XPP and with video card: ASUS N7800GT 512M, or equivalent), to support the preview display system. Any deviation from the specified equipment must be approved by NASA;.  D. One (1) VMAX Display System License for the preview display system; E. Two days of Adacel technical support training on the new IGs including 1) training and user manuals (3 copies) for airport database and aircraft model creation 2) training and documentation for VegaPrime control functions (e.g. .adf file) 3) database file structure; F.

One (1) year of standard warranty including hardware and software problem resolution, help desk support, software patches, and hardware trouble shooting, parts and labor; I.  3D to 2D conversion tool and documentation; J. Licenses for any third party software required for the integration;	 K.  Interface Control Document (ICD) describing interface between MaxSim 2.8 and PCIG. NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Adacel, Inc. because this is the only company known that is uniquely capable of providing the Image Generation System due to the proprietary interface between the PCIG and the existing MaxSim that operates FFC. An award to any other source would require a complete replacement of all of FFC’s operating software because it functions as an integrated system.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<SUBJECT>R--Dermal Absorption of DEET in Soil
<SOLNBR>RFQ-DC-06-00303
<RESPDATE>062206
<ARCHDATE>07222006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Paul Dawson, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-4473
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order under the procedures in FAR 8.4 to Dr. John Kissel, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 . Applicable NAICS code is 541620.  The effort to be performed is outlined below.  Dr. Kissel has conducted dermal absorptions studies in vivo and in vitro previously and has developed the protocols and procedures required to conduct analyses of DEET for this purchase order.  Few laboratories conduct dermal absorption studies. Of those most have developed procedures in a particular species such as swine at the  North Carolina State University or primates at the University of California at San Francisco. Others use surgically obtained human skin routinely such as the Colorado School of Mines. Most of these laboratories prefer to use in vitro test systems because they are cheaper and easier than dealing  with in vivo test systems. Importantly few of these investigators have sufficient expertise with conducting dermal absorption studies using contaminated soil. Proper soil classification to describe mineral components, particles sizes, organic content and moisture and sample preparation is essential  to prepare soil samples properly for dermal absorption studies. Prior to investigations in NCEA, investigators consistently failed to classify and prepare soil samples correctly which led to considerable errors in reports of their results in the literature. Dr. Kissel is a well know international  expert on dermal absorption from chemically contaminated soil and to our knowledge Dr. Kissel is the only investigator who routine conducts dermal absorption studies of chemically contaminated soil in vivo and in vitro. This makes his procedures unique compared to other investigators in this field.   Additionally Dr. Kissel has conducted work in previous studies under Cooperative Agreement #82963201 entitled AReview and evaluation of models of dermal absorption@.  Under this cooperative research agreement Dr. Kissel has reviewed the dermal absorption literature for chemically contaminated  water and soil. He has evaluated dermal absorption protocols and models used to estimate dermal exposure. Thus, he has completed a substantial component of the work required to conduct dermal absorption analyses of DEET previously.  Because Dr. Kissel has unique knowledge about dermal absorption of  chemically contaminated soil and has investigated the procedures required to conduct analyses of DEET, he is the logical choice to conduct these analyses in DEET.  	STATEMENT OF WORK I.  Background Dermal absorption from chemical contaminants in soil/sediment  A variety of models are in use  today to estimate the dermal absorption of chemicals from soils and water.  The accuracies of these models are widely questioned and the uncertainties/limitations not well understood.  The central reason for this problem is the lack of appropriate experimental data which can be used to develop and  test these models.  The problems with the data currently available include the use of experimental conditions which poorly represent actual exposure conditions and the difficulties in extrapolating in vitro or animal in vivo data to humans.  The purpose of this project is to conduct dermal  absorption studies to support development of these models.  The work will have the double benefit of helping the scientific community understand how to 1) conduct more useful dermal experiments and 2) evaluate/improve current dermal absorption models.   The structure for a soil model has not been  established.  Current research is focused on the release of contaminants from soil to skin. Investigations have been conducted to identify how chemical releases are influenced by contaminant concentrations, soil type, soil conditions, and soil loading amounts/patterns. These experiments identified  the important factors and permit development of a model to predict chemical releases to skin. In vitro methods, using artificial skin surrogates and cadaver skin have been investigated to identify the factors and release rates of contaminants from soil to skin. The purpose of this project is to  conduct in vivo dermal absorption studies using soil contaminated with DEET and to compare these results to dermal absorption studies conducted with in vitro procedures. Ultimately, the results of these studies will be used with information available about chemical release from soils and sediments  to develop a dermal absorption model for chemically contaminated soil.  II. Scope of Work The contractor shall develop a report about in vivo dermal absorption of DEET. The report shall contain:   1.	the protocol used to prepare chemically contaminated soil and test dermal absorption in vivo  using DEET,    2.	the results of the individual analyses with summary statistics, 3.	a comparison of these results with in vitro dermal absorption studies of soil contaminated with DEET to ascertain differences and,  4.	development of a dermal absorption model for chemically contaminated soil.  III. Deliverables and Professional Services Deliverables/Meetings                                                       Anticipated Completion Dates Provide a report that contains the protocol, 			120 days after award procedures, results, analyses and model as described in the Scope of Work.   The Contractor shall report to the NCEA Technical Project Officer (TPO) on a weekly or daily basis as needed.  The Contractor shall not release any of the data collected in this study nor publish any of the results of this work without the written consent of the TPO.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR  QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to US EPA, Attn: Paul Dawson (3803R), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington , DC 20460, or sent by email to dawson.paul@epa.gov. Telephone  requests or inquiries will not be accepted. Responses to this notice must be submitted within fifteen (15) days after this electronic posting. A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing  evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements

<DESC>The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) has a requirement for the provision of telephone conferencing equipment.

Established in 1939, the Administrative Office is the administrative arm of the federal Judiciary devoted to serving the courts in fulfilling the federal judicial system's critical mission, which is providing justice to the citizens of this country. The agency provides service to the federal courts in three essential areas: administrative support, program management, and policy development. It is charged with implementing the policies of the Judicial Conference of the United States and supporting the network of Conference committees. And, it is the focal point for Judiciary communication, information, program leadership, and administrative reform.

REQUIREMENTS

Various Circuit Courts of Appeals desire to replace their mediation telephone conferencing equipment. These courts utilize their conferencing equipment in slightly different manners. Also, the number of mediators in each circuit varies from one to ten, and the mediators may be located in as many as three separate offices within a circuit.  The common essential functions for the desired equipment are as follows:
Conferencing: Each mediator must be able to originate conference calls from his or her individual location with participants on at least six separate lines 
Calling-in: Participants must be able to call in to the conference, as well as be called by the mediator 
Caucusing: Mediators must be able to create separate and simultaneous caucuses in any  number or combination of participants during the course of the conference 
Return to Conference: Participants in separate caucuses must be able to return to the main conference call 
Dropping and adding: Mediators must be able to drop or add individual participants during the course of the conference 
Security: Conferences must be secure against outside eavesdropping, and conversations with and among participants in caucuses must be private from all other participants 
Simplicity: The equipment must be capable of operation by non-technologically- oriented mediators. Preferably a computer monitor will not be necessary 
Latency: If a computer program is utilized, there should be no noticeable latency between on-screen indicators and actual events 
Speaker Identification: A visual cue should show which lines are in use so as to identify who is speaking 
Recording: The equipment must not be capable of recording any conversations 
Sound Quality: All participants must be able to hear each other no matter how many lines are combined or caucused. 
Full Duplexing: Participants must be able to conduct natural, simultaneous, two-way conversations 
Maintenance: Maintenance or repairs of equipment would be performed or arranged for by each separate circuit, and the equipment of one circuit would not be interconnected with that of another circuit 
Interconnection: The equipment must be capable of being connected to various telephone arrangements in the different circuits 
A desirable, but not essential, feature would be the equipment's ability to allow mediators to conduct mediations from remote locations (such as home offices) for teleworking purposes.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Portland State University, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering the characterize effect of flow and sediment varistion in the Lower Columbia River and Estuary during the period July 2006 through June 2007. Variations in river flow, salinity, tidal, and sediment transport regimes of the Columbia River and its estuary have had a profound effect on Columbia River salmonids and their habitat. Human influences include the hydropower system (the largest single factor), irrigation withdrawal, navigational development, diking and filling, and changes in land use throughout the basin. These human alterations interact with each other and are difficult to separate from the influence of climate. Climate processes include a long-term increase in temperature, a decrease (relative to the 19th Century) in flow, and fluctuations in flow related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. Understanding how the river-flow, salinity, tidal, and sediment-supply regimes in the Columbia River system are evolving and how they interact with habitat availability will provide information critical to development of management strategies, including the maintenance and restoration of shallow water habitats used by juvenile salmon.

Task - Climate and human effects on river flow and sediment input.
Attempts to restore salmon habitat in the Columbia River tidal-fluvial regime require that the interaction of basic physical processes (e.g., river flow, tides, and sediment input) with habitat be defined. It is also important to define and model the trajectory of physical changes over recent decades, and determine how this has influenced salmonids, salmonid habitat, and the tidal-fluvial ecosystem and as whole. We will, therefore, use available data, new data analysis methods, and models to determine: 1) how changes in the salinity and tidal regimes affect habitat availability, 2) how river flow and sediment input to the system are related to climate and human alterations, and 3) how the variations between sub-basins of climate and anthropogenic effects affect lower river habitats.

Task - The interaction of tides, river flow, and shallow water habitat area.
This project approaches the above issues from the point of view: a) that data analyses are needed to reveal issues that need attention, and b) that simple models, especially those that are heavily constrained by data yet true to the underlying physics, are an extremely cost-effective means to understand processes and guide management. Thus, this task uses innovative data analysis methods and intelligently targeted models to determine how the tidal regime is affected by changes in flow magnitude and seasonality. River flow controls juvenile salmonid habitat availability directly by altering river stage, and indirectly by influencing tidal range. There is also a daily power peaking cycle that propagates downriver to the vicinity of Beaver, changes the character of the tide above Beaver, and affects the timing of high and low waters. These processees are relevant to salmonids for several reasons. First, it is important that Chum redds immediately below Bonneville Dam remain underwater during certain key periods, and water elevations in this portion of the river are a function of both dam operation and the oceanic tidal influence. Second, tidal range affects juvenile salmonid habitat location and availability during their migration through the lower river and estuary. Alterations of seasonality and strength of the annual river flow cycle and especially the changes in volume and timing of the spring freshet mean that the annual cycle of tidal range has changed since construction of the hydropower system. The net result is that habitat for juvenile salmonids has been displaced in time and space. Habitat availability reaches a maximum earlier in the season than historically and has been relegated to lower elevations (and decreased in extent) by the reduction in river stage in spring. Its character has changed both because of the displacement, and because tidal range during spring has increased.

<SUBJECT>R -- Cataloguing of Northwestern Hawaiian Islands marine invertebrates housed at the Bishop Museum collected from NWHI-RAMP activities
<SOLNBR>WASC-6-0776
<RESPDATE>062206
<ARCHDATE>07072006

<DESC>NOAA's Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve has a requirement for cataloguing of Northwestern Hawaiian Islands marine invertebrates. 
Background  -  The National Marine Sanctuary Program (NMSP), established in 1972 by the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) and administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), protects a network of 13 special marine and freshwater areas.  The goal of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act is to set aside and manage areas for resource protection, research, enhanced public education, and compatible public and private uses.  Management activities for each sanctuary are detailed in site-specific management plans which outline regulatory goals, describe boundaries, identify staffing and budget needs, and set priorities and performance measures for resource protection, research, and education programs. 
The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve (Reserve) was established by Executive Order 13176 on December 4, 2000 to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and lasting protection of the coral reef ecosystem and related marine resources and species of the region. These waters contain a large portion of all coral reefs found in the United States’ jurisdiction and support more than 7,000 marine species, of which one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands chain.  The 1200-mile stretch of remote islands, atolls and reefs, is also the most remote archipelago in the world.

In 2001, NOAA initiated a process to consider designating the waters surrounding the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) as a National Marine Sanctuary.  The sanctuary designation process, combined with NOAA’s goal to manage the use of coastal and ocean resources through ecosystem approaches to management, requires an integrated approach to resource management that does not focus on a single species or activity, but considers the ecosystem as a whole.

In October of 2002 the NOAA vessel Townsend Cromwell and the chartered vessel Rapture provided logistical support for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Rapid Assessment and Monitoring Program (NOW-RAMP). The focus of the expedition was to assess the condition and health of the remote coral reef ecosystems of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). A total of 57 days were spent collecting data from 11 islands, shoals, and banks encompassing 1200 miles. A total of 204 rapid ecological assessments were conducted by three teams throughout the expedition, with hundreds of marine invertebrate specimens being collected. Field notes were recorded from the wealth of habitats present in the NWHI and specimens (with associated field observations) were obtained for all specific collection localities. This expedition represents the largest to date to collect marine invertebrate specimens from the NWHI. This material and smaller scale collections from following years is currently housed at the Bishop Museum.

The identification of this material began in 2004 with focused funding by the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve (NWHICRER). The goal was to create an inventory of marine invertebrate fauna associated with the NWHI, of which mollusks, echinoderms, and bryozoans have been completed. This inventory process will continue under other contractual agreements that are in place but an integral step is the cataloging of all material, both identified and unidentified. A rough estimation of the number of lots is 3500, with an estimated 6000 individual specimens.

The goal of this project is to provide an archival database for all material in this collection.

Develop and standardize a collection database for the purpose of cataloging all identified and unidentified material.  The period of performance is 12 months from the start of the contract (projected to be September 1, 2006 through September 1, 2007. All responsible sources may submit a bid for consideration. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing to the attention: melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

<DESC>--This notice has been modified due to a date change.--

The Government Printing Office (GPO) intends to issue a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB).  The GPO is seeking a contractor to assist FRTIB staff in conducting (development, delivery, and analysis of) a survey of Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) participants.  The GPO is requesting a bid for services on a single survey only; however, this initial survey will serve as the basis for a longitudinal survey process, with additional surveys to be conducted at regular intervals in the future.  In consultation with the FRTIB, the contractor must be able to perform the following tasks: determine appropriate survey methodology, identify appropriate sample populations, develop survey questions, pretest and conduct the survey, tabulate the survey results, analyze the statistical data, produce a written report of survey results and provide raw data to the Agency in an electronic format.  The contractor should have extensive experience conducting surveys of participants in employee benefit plans.

It is contemplated that a fixed-price contract will be awarded for this effort.  Estimated release date for the solicitation is on or about June 13, 2006.  GPO seeks to have the survey process completed and final report delivered no later October 31, 2006.  

Electronic copies of the RFP and any other documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Requests for paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted.

<DESC>This project will be a comprehensive evaluation of each program allocation formula, to include analysis and findings on each formula’s consistency with the new NRCS strategic plan; consistency with program statutory authorities and regulatory requirements, and program goals and objectives; technical and analytical defensibility of the formula (parameter and variable selection, formula functional form) and data sources; the efficiency and effectiveness of allocation outcomes as a result of formula.  The evaluation also should examine the impact of Regional Equity on program allocations to states, including its impact nationwide on the efficiency and effectiveness of affected programs.  The deliverable will be used to provide guidance for improvement in allocation formulas, as evidence to support NRCS’s allocation formulas to interested external parties, to provide a template for which to evaluate future allocation formulas, and finally as a means to assess how allocation formulas relate to programmatic efficiency and annual/long-term performance measures.

This two (2) day Industry Day meeting will be held at The Aerospace Corporation, Bldg A-8 basement auditorium(to be scheduled), 2350 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. 

A 1st Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for TSAT Space is scheduled to be released in Sep 06, a 2nd DRFP in 1QFY07, and a final RFP in 3QFY07.  This will be followed by a full and open competition for the D&P phase with proposals due in 3QFY07, a selection of a single contractor in 1QFY08, and a first launch in FY14.  The Government expects three more industry days before the final RFP release, after the 1st and 2nd draft RFP releases and following Systems Design Review (SDR), Sep 06, Dec 06 and Mar 07, respectively.


To help meet TSAT Block 1 and 2 deployment schedules, the TSAT Program Office is soliciting 1) acquisition approaches and potential award fee incentives to reduce risk and increase confidence in systems performance and in the program cost and schedule; 2) lessons learned and best practices; 3) system integration initiatives; and 4) feedback on the program risks, candidate structure for the evaluation, statement of objectives, compliance document list, contract data deliverables list, Technical Requirements Documents (TRD) and work breakdown structure (WBS).

All interested parties are invited to attend Day 1 when the government team will present program overview and objectives, the acquisition strategy, system and segment requirements, and required interaction with the other segments.  The TSAT Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) segment will brief on the system requirements and TSAT Mission Operations System (TMOS) segment will brief the status of TMOS acquisition.  Day 2 will be used to meet individually with potential prime contractors who formally request a one-on-one session with the Government.  These potential prime contractors are required to submit the above mentioned white paper along with a separate list of discussions questions for the one-on-one session, along with a statement of capability requirements.   The Government will only provide information during these sessions that is equally available to all interested parties.

The following is the information that was published on 26 Apr 2006 for the Digital Video Laboratory (DVL):

	The Air Armament Center (AAC), 46th Test Wing/TSS (Investment Programs Office), is contemplating awarding a five year Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) follow-on effort for the Digital Video Laboratory (DVL).  The joint aircraft/stores certification community has a need to implement digital video technology for end-to-end test processes, as well as apply video software tools to Satellite, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Range Test and Evaluation (T&E) imagery.  The capabilities are being provided using a Spiral Development approach, which defines requirements based on feedback from previous deliveries.  Prospective offerors may submit Statement of Capabilities (SOC) that will provide substantiated evidence that they possess the detailed knowledge and capabilities to perform the required effort.  All responses to this synopsis will be evaluated in the following areas:  1) Ability to provide enhancements to the DVL delivered Digital Multimedia Management System (DMMS) and Video Analysis tools.  Enhancements include as a minimum: a) sharing of data between customer databases and the DMMS, b) advance search techniques, and c) integration to quantitative analysis tools.  2) Organic knowledge of the full spectrum of technologies associated with development and applications of digital video systems, including sensors, compression, transmission, processing, exploitation, storage, retrieval, and presentation.  This includes, but is not limited to:  a) digital video imaging sensors and systems; b) digital video compression in multiple formats, frame rates, and with techniques that utilize full resolution of all components at dynamic ranges equal to, or exceeding, that of MPEG-2; c) perceptual quality measurement techniques for video quality metering; d) digital video stabilization algorithms that can be implemented in both real-time and non real-time scenarios; e) digital video archive and retrieval systems; f) digital studio procedures that allow users to access data in a variety of formats from a variety of sources; g) video compositing and mosaicing methods that provide extended resolution and expanded context beyond a traditional field of view; h) moving target indication algorithms to locate and track the paths of several objects within a field of view; i) compressed domain-processing techniques, which allow for some analysis of video without the need to decompress; j) visualization techniques that provide novel and innovative ways to display a range of data within video; and k) real-time Video Database Ingestion.  3)  Firm connections and understanding of the commercial digital video market including commercial research and development laboratories; and 4) Demonstrated knowledge and experience with process oriented integration of digital video into military and other government agency applications.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  Responders to this synopsis will not be provided the results of the government evaluation of their SOC.  The NAICs code for this effort is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  The total estimated value of this effort is $49M.  In responding, reference RFP FA9200-06-R-0262.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When required, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or Program Manager identified above.  For any other concerns, interested parties may call the AAC Ombudsman, Colonel Joseph Lannie, and AAC/CV at (850) 882-0662.  Numbered notes 25 and 26 applies.

<DESC>The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) is seeking a contractor to perform investment and recordkeeping tasks in support of the Court Registry Investment System (CRIS).  The Court Registry Investment System (CRIS) is a cash management system for court registry funds developed and tested by the Clerk, hereinafter called “CRIS Fund Manager”, of the United States District Court of the Southern District of Texas (TX-S), which is located in Houston.  The system began operations in 1988.  Currently there are twenty-three participating courts around the country.  As of June 30, 2005, the registry fund total for all federal courts was approximately $3.3 billion of which $1.8 billion was invested in CRIS.  

Securities purchased are normally held until maturity.  Safety of principal and liquidity of investments without sacrificing principal are among the more important objectives of the CRIS.  The Clerk of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Texas, known as the CRIS Fund Manager, seeks a contractor to assist in developing portfolio strategies to accomplish the objectives of CRIS, to advise on the selection of specific investments, to execute directed securities transactions, and to maintain case-by-case accounting records.

In brief, each week the CRIS Fund Manager is advised of new deposits and planned withdrawals.  The contractor will advise what security transactions, consistent with the CRIS objectives, are appropriate in these instances.  The CRIS Fund Manager will then direct the contractor to buy or sell specific securities.  Securities purchased by the contractor will be transferred to the CRIS account in the Securities Handling Resource-sharing Endeavour (SHARE) system maintained by the Federal Reserve.  Once confirmation of the transfer has been received from the Federal Reserve Bank an immediate payment (deposit) will be recorded in the contractor’s reserve account at the Federal Reserve Bank.  In those rare instances when securities must be sold prior to maturity, funds must be deposited in Treasury’s General Account at the Federal Reserve Bank prior to the securities being transferred from the CRIS account in SHARE.  Because monies remain on deposit with the Treasury and are never in possession of the contractor, there are no collateral requirements.  The contractor will next update individual case records by adding new deposits, subtracting withdrawals and allocating portfolio earnings.  A case investment report will then be mailed to each court member.  Other portfolio information and statistics will be provided to the CRIS Fund Manager on a regular basis.  The solicitation is scheduled to be released on or about June 30, 2006.  The point of contact for this solicitation is Michelle Hupp, Contracting Officer, (202) 502-1574.

<DESC>The US Army ARDEC-Picatinny is conducting a Market Survey to identify  potential sources for supplying the U.S. Army with the establishment of the  Center for Integrated Security Logistics. The requirement for this award is to  establish a Center for Integrated Security Logistics and begin the process of  developing four components that will dramatically improve the Office of  Homeland Defense ability to respond to emergency events via a more secure  logistics supply chain as well as have application to similar problems  encountered by the Army's ammunition distribution mission.  The four systems  are: a) HSMS, a low-cost, high reliability health and status monitoring system  (HSMS) as a safeguard against specific environmental degradations; b) IAS, an  Intelligent Asset system (IAS) for real-time inventory of assets; c) AAC, a  real-time AIT concept to enable total Asset Accountability/Consumption (AAC)  down to the emergency response system.  Enables on location visibility of  shipped assets; and d) AAL, an Anticipatory (Sense and Respond) Asset Logistics  Portal (AALP) for responsive end-to-end supply chain. All of these proposed  systems will be demonstrated at Homeland Defense exercises planned for the next  FY. This approach will also be tailored to support similar visibility and  accountability problems with the Army's ammunition supply chain and  demonstrated at various ammunition supply point nodes.  Delivery is planned for  the first quarter of the fiscal year 2007.  The Government intends to award on  sole source basis, a contract to University of Maryland, Center for Public  Policy and Private Enterprise, School of Public Affairs. Respondents should  have sufficient capability to furnish these requirements to the U.S. Army.   Interested firms, who feel they are capable, are invited to indicate their  interest by providing to the U.S. Army a brief summary of their companyâ€™s  capabilities including brief description of facilities, personnel, and past  experience. A follow-up detailed questionnaire may be provided to survey  respondents and on-site visits may be performed as a result of further  analysis. Also, interested firms should provide the name, address, point-of- contact with telephone number and e-mail address, size of business  (small/large) and where the facility is located. The information must be  submitted within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication to: U.S.  Army TACOM-ARDEC/ATTN: AMSTA-AQ-APJ, Ms. Rachael Houle/Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07850/e-mail: rachael.houle@us.army.mil.  If there are any technical questions,  please contact Mr. Alan Santucci @ (973) 724-4737. This Market Survey is for  planning purposes only and should not be construed as a request for proposal or  as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government does  not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Market Survey or otherwise  pay for information solicited. The information you provide will only be used by  the U.S. Army in developing its acquisition approach for future warhead  research and development requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  This is not a notice of RFP issuance.  All sources capable of providing the required services are being sought.  The C-5 systems group is conducting market research to seek qualified sources capable of production and installation of the Large Aircraft Infrared countermeasure (LAIRCM) on C-5 aircraft.  A production and installation contract will be awarded in April 2007 for the purpose of fielding 5 systems in FY08.  The government does not own the data rights or drawings for the system; therefore, to avoid duplication costs, a prospective company must possesses all C-5 source data required to accomplish this effort.  The estimated period of performance will be for a 48 month period.     

The contractor must ensure that the LAIRCM system integrates with all systems, subsystems, and components of the C-5 aircraft.  LAIRCM must be installed in the aircraft without any degradation of performance of the aircraft.  Both the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) and Reliability Enhancement and Re-Engineering Program (RERP) must be considered for installation of the LAIRCM system.  Additionally Air Mobility Command (AMC) has directed 5 C-5B aircraft containing LAIRCM hardware must be completed not later than FY08 to fulfill mission requirements. 

The government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this request.  Interested businesses are required to submit their statement of interest and capabilities to LaToya Brown.  All responses are required not later than 20 June 2006 and may be mailed to Aeronautical Systems Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, ATTN: LaToya Brown, 2590 Loop Road West, Building 558, Room 210, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7142, faxed to 937-656-5020, or emailed to latoya.brown@wpafb.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>55--Intent to extend the Y-12 Protective Forces Security Contract
<SOLNBR>DE-AC05-02OR22928
<RESPDATE>061906
<ARCHDATE>12192006
<CONTACT>Carol Elliott, Contracting Officer, 865-574-3233, elliottcr@y12.doe.gov;Carol Elliott, Contract Specialist, 865-574-3233, elliottcr@y12.doe.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Y-12 Site Office (YSO) intends to contract by means other than full and open under the provisions of 41 U.S.C. Â§253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  YSO intends to negotiate an short-term extension to the current contract, DE-AC05-02OR22928, with Wackenhut Services, Inc., for the physical protection of Government assets at the Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12 NSC) through its paramilitary protective force.  This action is to extend for up to three months a contract which has been in place since July 2002 and is scheduled to expire June 30, 2006.  The extension will be for one month with two consecutive one-month options.  The estimated value of this contract extension, including options, is $22,000,000. A full and open competitive solicitation for award of a contract to provide Protective Force (ProForce) Security Services was issued in November 2005. A new contract award is anticipated in the summer of 2006, but there is not sufficient time to award the new Pro Force contract and complete transition activities before the current contract expires. The scope of work for this contract extension includes Protective Force Operations, including a paramilitary force; Information Security; Technical Surveillance Countermeasures; Personnel Security Clearances; Human Reliability Program; and Technical Support.  The contractor will provide fully armed and unarmed paramilitary protective force services at the Y-12 NSC and the Central Training Facility. These services include protection of special nuclear material, personnel, classified and unclassified documents, Government property and facilities, and the staffing of 24-hour central alarm stations (CAS) and secondary alarm stations (SAS). The contract includes providing canine support, trained and qualified in explosives, narcotics and human presence detection; security movement of special nuclear material; and performance testing.   The contract includes managing and operating the Central Training Facility and providing a certified training program to meet training requirements for both new personnel and required annual training. The use of other than full and open competition for the proposed actions is authorized by 41 USC Â§253(c)(1).  This section provides that when the supplies and services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, a contract may be awarded without full and open competition. Because of the short term nature of this bridge contract, only the incumbent contractor may provide the require services.  The time required to receive the necessary security clearances; hire the over 500 ProForce personnel; accept and/or re-negotiate the Collective Bargaining Agreement; and establish a comparable benefits program that includes a defined pension benefit would exceed the period of performance of the bridge contract. Firms that want to challenge the sole-source nature of this action must submit a letter and other information that demonstrates your firmâ€™s ability to provide an equivalent service and rationale as to why your firm should be considered. All interested firms must respond by 2:00 PM (EST), June 19, 2006, to Carol Elliott, National Nuclear Security Administration, Y-12 Site Office, P.O. Box 2050, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 or E-Mail at elliottcr@yso.doe.gov.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract extension is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No reimbursement for any costs connected with providing capability information will be provided by NNSA.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Boulder CO proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Coherent Laser Group, 612 Race Street, Denver, CO 80206 for a 10 W solid state, single-frequency laser. The laser serves two purposes: 1) as the pump source for an existing Titanium Sapphire laser oscillator required for coherent manipulation and trapping of ultra cold atomic samples; 2) for coherent manipulation and trapping of ultra cold atomic samples. Both applications require >10 W, single frequency, very low noise operation (both intensity noise and frequency noise), with good long-term stability. Specifications for the required solid state, sealed, single-frequency laser are: 
1) Power >10 W wavelength 532 nm; noise ,0.03% rms; noise bandwidth 10 Hz to 1 GHz linewidth <5 MHz, single longitudinal mode; Power stability +/-1% over 2 hours after 15 minute warmup; pointing stability <5 microradians per degree Celsius; 
2) The laser must deliver non-mode-hop, single-longitudinal-mode output; ie, linewidth must be under 5 MHz. Systems based on a multi-axial design (MAD or QMAD) are not acceptable because of the wide linewidth and mode-beating noise inherent in this design.
3) The laser must have a noise performance of lower than 0.03% rms from 10 Hz to 1 GHz. Systems that specify noise in smaller bandwidths are not acceptable because they under-measure the total noise output. This low-noise performance is required for coherent manipulation and trapping of ultracold atomic.
4) To ensure maximum pump diode lifetime, the laser system must automatically and continuously optimize the pump diode wavelength to maximize optical conversions efficiency. Systems that use an assumed pre-programmed decay rate are unacceptable. 
5) When replacing the pump laser diode modules, the laser head position and beam propagation path must not change, nor shall the laser cavity require any realignment or exposure to the laboratory environment. Therefore, the pump diode module and the delivery fiber must detach from each other; the delivery fiber must not detach at the laser head when replacing the laser pump diode module.
6) The pump diode delivery fiber must be single-core multimode. Multiple fiber bundles are not acceptable because of the reduced pumping efficiency and lifetime.
7) All specifications must be clearly stated in published vendor brochures and/or data sheets.
Through market research it was determined that Coherent Verdi is the only product fulfilling all specifications including the single longitudinal mode. This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether on not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government’s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or e-mail before June 22, 2006. Anticipated award date is June 23, 2006.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI):  For Wireless Power Transmission over Very Short Distances. Pursuant to FAR 15.2, this notice is being issued as a Research and Development Information Sought. Contract POC: Ms. Ruth Woodham, US Army Aviation and Missile Command, AMSAM-AC-RD-AY, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898. This is a pre-solicitation REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is currently conducting market research only. No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the G overnment intend to pay for information received. Responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. AMRDEC is interested in receiving information on Wireless Power Transmission over Very  Short Distances concerning technologies that are already in existence that can be utilized to implement mateless or virtual connection technology between electronic hardwares in an automated environment. Information from diverse technology fields includin g both non-military and military sources are sought. The objective of the US Army is to determine the means to implement mateless or virtual connection technology between electronic hardwares in an automated environment. This method will prevent the constraint of precision mating/demating of hardwired connec tors. Electrical contacts are subject to environment, degradation, and high maintenance, so that a simple non precision mating of electrical contacts is not permitted.  While various touchless methods are available for communication requirements, the technologies available to transmit power are very limited, especially for this range of interest.  This RFI is soliciting potential technologies, ideas, and information relev ant to the transmission of power (10s to 100s of watts electrical) in atmospheric air medium over short distances (less than 1 inch) with Pout/Pin efficiencies of at least 70 percent. Efforts presently being pursued are based on transformer coupling, but other ideas in this area are welcome as well.  Optical, RF, and acoustic methods have been examined in the past, but were not tailored to this application.  Six general requirements are  as follows: (1) Average Power. The technology should be capable of continuous power transmission on the order of 10 to 100 watts for a significant duration, with 1 to 2 minutes as a starting point.  Approximately 100 watts is anticipated for use in a demonstration pro gram.  Later versions may operate for hours. (2) Peak Power. It is desirable for the technology to be capable of 25 to 50 percent additional power for a few milliseconds duration. (3) Transmission Medium. The intended applications are not sealed, so that a tmospheric air is present between transmitter and receiver.  Uses requiring stored gases or liquids for propagation are discouraged. (4) Distance. The propagation distances anticipated are expected to be on the order of zero (mechanical contact permitted a s long as precision mating not required) to 0.125 inches.  Propagation up to 1 inch is of interest. (5) Efficiency. High efficiencies are desired, with a minimum of approximately 70 percent.  Efficiency is taken as Pout/Pin. (6) Durability. The transducers  or active elements on both sides of the transmission system will be individually sealed in practice to protect them from the environment.  Preferred technologies can be environmentally sealed. Responses to this RFI should only include technologies that are in a lab-prototype stage or those that have been successfully demonstrated for the application for which they were developed. The response should include a white paper of no more than 15 pages , whether hardcopy or electronic; unclassified electronic submission attachments on e-mail transmittals must be readable with Microsoft Office software (recommended less than 5 Megabyte).  Whitepapers submitted in response to this solicita tion shall be single spaced, have Times New Roman size 11 font with one inch margins, and be titled, Wireless Power Transmission Over Very Short Distances.  Submissions shall include the technology and results-to-date, as well as points of contact for Gove rnment sponsors, where applicable.  A rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimate to implement or initially test the technology at the contractors facility or at AMRDEC facilities is requested. RFI responses are to be received within 21 calendar days of t he date of this notice, or no later than 1700 hours (CST), 30 June, 2006. All information must be in writing or via e-mail; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward responses to US Army, AMCOM, AMSAM-AC-RD-RB, Reds tone Arsenal, AL, 35898-5000, ATTN: Ms. Ruth Woodham or via the following e-mail address: ruth.a.woodham@redstone.army.mil; Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued if request for return receipt is included with response. All information submitted will be  treated as confidential and will not be released outside the Government. All submissions must be clearly marked with the following caption:  Releasable to Government Agencies for Evaluation Purposes Only. The Government reserves the right to request furth er clarification or request presentations to enhance the Governments understanding of the respondents submittal.  RFI responses will be accepted from United States companies and organizations only.  All respondents will be notified of the disposition of th eir whitepaper.  Whitepapers that fail to comply with the above instructions, or present ideas not pertinent to subject, may not be reviewed.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations paragraph 15.201 (e.), responses to this notice are not offers  and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No award is intended as a result of this RFI.  Information submitted in response to this RFI is submitted at no cost to the Government.

Statement of Work

The Biopharmaceutical Development Program (BDP) located at the National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Maryland is attempting to identify qualified vendors with experience in humanization of monoclonal antibodies.  The overall goal of this work is for the vendor to receive a murine hybridoma that expresses a mAb and provide at least two cell lines that express a “humanized” or “fully human” version of the antibody with similar epitope binding characteristics.  This antibody will ultimately be used in pre-clinical and clinical studies.  The proposal may be either fixed price or cost reimbursable and may be performed under non-GLP, GLP, or cGMP compliant conditions.  The use of non-BSE components throughout the process is preferred.  

The deliverables include:

1. 	Sequencing and/or cloning of the appropriate murine heavy and light chain sequences from the hybridoma provided by the BDP.

2.  	Cloning of humanized vectors and release of confirmatory DNA sequence information to the BDP.  

3.  	Generate at least 2 stable cell lines that produce the humanized antibody.  The antibody must maintain epitope binding characteristics that are similar to the parental mAb.  Expression levels should be adequate for multi-gram productions.  

4.	Provide a reference lot (~ 1 L) of supernatant from each cell line to the BDP for use strictly in a small scale mAb purification process followed by limited characterization to assess the quality of the expressed mAb.

5.	Upon approval, transfer of the appropriate cell line or lines to the BDP.  The cell line(s) may be provided in an accession bank or cGMP compliant master cell bank format.  

6. 	All GMP work will be performed under the SAIC Frederick, Inc. Quality Agreement or a mutually agreed upon Quality Agreement.


THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY SAIC-FREDERICK, INC. OR THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

<DESC>Description: The purpose of this announcement is to request proposals for a one (1) week demonstration effort at the specified government test site to detect and classify moving and stationary vehicles using high resolution SAR and GMTI capable radar.  Proposals should  be submitted against the I2WD BAA Solicitation No., W15P7T-04-R-P008, ISR Subtopic 2  Radar Applications, for a 4QFY06 award.  The Government has total of $480K for contracts, and is planning to award up to three contracts.  Award is not guaranteed and t he Government does not intend to pay for information received.   The specific intent of this effort is to demonstrate the capabilities of the existing lightweight SAR/GMTI radars and assess current technology maturity level.  Assessment will utilize Draft SAR/GMTI Requirements Document for mini-SAR/GMTI in Shadow UAS as  the basis for requirements.  The government will provide demonstration plan/procedures, test site, test targets and office space needed at site for this demonstration.  The government does not intend to pay for the development of radar, integration of rad ar onto aircraft, and equipment needed for recording and reduction of the collected data.  The demonstration will be scheduled to be conducted in October 2006 at Ft. Huachuca, AZ.  The vendor should plan for one week demonstration consisting of one day set up, three days of data collection (up to 4 hours of flight time each day), and one day to pack-up after demonstration.  The following is a synopsis of the proposed Shadow SAR/GMTI requirements.  The demonstration systems are not required to meet all of the  following, but selection of participants will be partly based on stated maturity levels.   1)  The total radar payload weight should be less than 65 lbs.  Radars with minimal weight are preferable. 2)  The radar should be capable of operating in SAR and GMTI modes. 3)  The GMTI mode will detect vehicles, standard military target 5.15m x 1.75m x 1.86m (L x H x W), moving at the speed of 10-70kph to a range of 7km at 8000ft AGL altitude.   The GMTI sensor will be capable of revisiting 345 degrees once every 30 seconds and will be capable of selectable sector scans. 4)  The SAR mode will have a wide area search mode of 1.0m resolution and a spot mode of 0.3m resolution to a range of 7km at 8000 ft AGL altitude.   5)  The SAR sensor system will have a Target Location Error (TLE) which supports the air vehicles Target Location Accuracy (TLA) of less than 25m while at 7km standoff range.   6)  The SAR/GMTI sensor system will maintain an operational availability (Ao) of 80%.   7)  The SAR/GMTI sensor system will provide near real-time imagery to the controlling station.   The lightweight SAR/GMTI radar integrated on the contractor aircraft, and on board data recorders will be capable of data collection according to government demonstration plan.  The demonstration plan will be provided shortly after contract award.  Governm ent will consider feedback on the demonstration plan from contractors.  The reduced/processed data will be provided to the government according to the STANAG 4607 and NITF 2.1 or equivalent formats on CD and/or DVD media.  The analysis and report for this demonstration will be written by the government.   Vendors without having the required lightweight SAR/GMTI radar integrated on the contractors platform ready for demonstration will not be considered.   Responses are to be received by 10:00 EST, 30 JUNE 2006.  All information must be in writing or via e-mail.  You may forward responses to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN:  AMSRD-CER-IW-BA (Mr. Gunol) or the followin g e-mail address: Eldar.Gunol@us.army.mil.

The Army Contracting Agency Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE) on behalf of the US Department of the Army, (DA), Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff G-4, (ODCS, G-4), Pentagon, is conducting a Sources Sought/Market  Research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.001 to determine the extent of small business capabilities in performing the requirement for procuring services for Adaptive Logistics in Support of Sense and Respond Logistics (S&RL) .   The Logistics Transformation Agency (LTA) has been tasked by the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff (ODCS) G4, to provide the Armys input to Sense and Respond Logistics (S&RL).  S&RL is a principle tenet of Focused Logistics and is a critical enabler  to transformation.  The concept of S&RL relies upon highly adaptive, self-synchronizing, and dynamic physical and functional processes, employing and enhancing operational cognitive decision support.  The S&RL concept predicts, anticipates and coordinates  actions that provide warfighting advantages spanning the full range of military operations across the strategic, operational and tactical levels of war.  It requires a network-centric enterprise and disciplined collaboration within and across Communities of Interest (COI).  Synchronizing the logisticians decision cycle to that of the warfighter enables a logistics system that is focused on the effect a given action in the logistics domain will have on the warfighters planned or executing intent.  The end state is for logisticians to operate within the construct of a global, end-to-end distribution based enterprise that synchronizes and integrates all elements of the logistics system to ensure consistent, reliable, and predictable support to the Joint Force  Commanders concept of operations.  All responsible small business sources are invited, at no cost to the Government, to provide technical information for a capability evaluation.  This Sources Sought/Market Research shall not be construed as a Request fo r Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a contract from the results of this Sources Sought Notice.

<SUBJECT>--Use of Brand Name King-Fisher and Johnson Control's Metasys products in Solicitation W91ZLK-06-R-0018
<DESC>Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) has a need when issuing individual task orders under proposed Solicitation W91ZLK-06-R-0018 to specify standardized fire alarm control equipment and direct digital heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) control  equipment on a sole source basis.   Since 1986, the APG fire department standardized its fire alarm monitoring system using King-Fisher fire alarm control equipment.  These products will be used to monitor approximately 1100 buildings to ensure the safety  of all building occupants.  APG also standardized its HVAC control equipment in 1990 using Johnson Controls Metasys Direct Digital HVAC control equipment.  Task order scopes of work will specify brand name King-Fisher and Johnson Controls Metasys produc ts when needed.  The Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1).

<DESC>PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.    This solicitation is being issued as a small business set-aside under Request for Quotation No. 2006-Q-08633.   The NAICS is 335999 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-9. 
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Spokane, WA has a requirement for a proximity warning system.  

Project Identification and Purpose. Background and Need Construction workers are at risk of fatal and serious nonfatal injuries when working on foot near construction vehicles (e.g., dump trucks) and equipment (e.g., graders, wheeled loaders, and excavators). Between 1992 and 1998, excluding collisions between vehicles and single-vehicle crashes, 818 construction workers were killed in incidents involving construction equipment and trucks. Of these, 703 deaths were due to a worker on foot being struck by the vehicle (437 deaths), or to being caught between vehicles or caught in or pinned by a vehicle (266 deaths). The types of vehicles and equipment most often involved in these incidents were dump trucks (176), semi-trucks (86), backhoes (71), pickup trucks (61), loaders (58), and graders, levelers, planers, and scrapers (34). NIOSH recently published an analysis of fatal injuries in the highway and street construction industry (Pratt et al. 2001). From 1992-1998, approximately 150 workers were killed when struck by construction vehicles or equipment while working within the confines of a roadway work zone. Trucks were the predominant source of injury in these fatalities, accounting for 61%, with machinery accounting for another 30%. The primary type of truck involved was dump trucks (45% of trucks). Road grading and surfacing machines were the primary types of equipment involved, followed by excavating machinery and loaders. Proximity warning systems and visibility aids can provide an equipment operator with information about obstacles in the blind areas of the equipment. Tests of existing proximity warning systems have shown a need for a new system that addresses the specific requirements of equipment in construction work zones. Existing systems based on radar, ultrasonic, and infrared sensors have one or more of the following limitations: 1) high false and nuisance alarm rates; 2) inadequate detection zones; 3) no warning provided to a worker on foot. 4) Oversized packaging that is too large for the available mounting locations; or 5) unreliable operation in the harsh environmental conditions found on construction sites. A new system is needed that addresses the specific needs of construction equipment and of construction workers. The system must be applicable to dump trucks and other types of equipment, such as small to medium-sized earth moving machinery, e.g. road graders, wheeled loaders. REQUIREMENTS
 The following will be required: 1. The system shall only generate alarms at the PAD and at the cab alarm display when the vehicle is in reverse. An input terminal or common connector must be available on the cab display box to connect a 12Vdc signal (provided by the vehicle) that is on when in reverse and off when in any other gear. 2. Audible alarms at the PAD must be modified so they are distinguishable from other alarms on a construction site. They must be heard above background noise typical of construction sites (other vehicle backup alarms, engine noise, etc.). A vibrating alarm similar to a cellular phone vibrator is to be added internally with the ability to turn this option off. 3. The PAD alarm zones must provide graded alarms in the following manner (distances are approximate): • 0-8ft from vehicle: continuous tone and vibration (if selected) at PAD, and continuous tone at cab alarm. • 8-15ft from vehicle: pulsed tone and no vibration at PAD, and pulsed tone at cab alarm. (A periodic series of three fast pulses for both the PAD and cab alarm would be distinguishable from other noises.) 4. The cab alarm display must be modified as follows: • Provide one small green LED to indicate that the system is on (preferably in the upper left corner of the display box). • Change visual alarms to one large red LED and one large yellow LED that indicate the detection of a PAD in the following manner: Yellow LED lit when PAD is within 8-15ft, and red LED lit when PAD is within 0-8ft. • If multiple PADs are detected the audible and visual cab alarm display must present information on the closest PAD. • An internal volume control is to be added for the audible alarm. • The size of the cab alarm box should be as small as possible – it will be mounted on the dash to the left of the steering wheel if possible. Alternatively, a small remote alarm box containing the LEDs could be connected by wire to a larger control box. 5. A 12V output signal must be available at the cab display box that is activated when a PAD is detected in any detection zone (0-15ft). This signal will be used to trigger a VCR when an alarm is activated in the cab. Connection can be made either on an external terminal strip or using a common plug-type connector. 6. The PAD and battery must be packaged in a single enclosure. The battery must provide power to operate the PAD for 10 hours. The enclosure must be made as small as possible, no larger than 1.5 x 3.5 x 5 inches (it will be attached to a worker’s belt or put in a vest pocket). The battery must be rechargeable (maximum charge time 12 hours). There is no IS or XP requirement for this application. 7. The PAD must have some visible indication that is it working. A green or blue LED when powered on is acceptable. Low battery power should be indicated by a periodic double beep. 8. After the modifications are made, two systems and two PADs will be sent to the Spokane Research Laboratory for preliminary tests. After NIOSH engineers review and approve the modifications, seven (7) complete proximity warning systems will be delivered as follows: • Proximity warning system for vehicles consisting of cabling, field generator, cab alarm display - Quantity 7 each. • Personnel tags or PADs, with batteries – Quantity 20 each. • Charging system for 20 PADs – Quantity depends on battery capacity. (specify quantity required). A field engineer from the vendor will be required to help install systems and troubleshoot at the construction test site for at least a portion of the test period. Two travel days and four work days will be required. The estimate can be based on travel to Spokane, WA as the test site will likely be near that location. Exact date will be determined later. Deliverables and Schedule 1. Two complete systems and two PADs for preliminary acceptance test – due 65 days after contract award (NIOSH engineers will test within 2 days). 2. Delivery of final proximity warning systems, PADs, and charging systems – due 80 days after contract award. 3. Field test support at construction site – date to be determined, but will occur between system delivery date and December of 2006. Deliverables will be sent to: NIOSH/CDC Spokane Research Laboratory 315 East Montgomery Avenue Spokane, WA 9920.
Period of Performance The contract period shall extend 80 days from the contract award date (approximately June 17, 2006 to September 1, 2006).

<DESC>Arcata Associates, Inc. (Arcata), in support of the Research Facilities and Engineering Support Services contract at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, intends to acquire two (2) S-Band and Lower and Upper L-Band Flight Qualified Transmitter and Receivers.   Required features of the transmitter are: •	PCM/FM Modulation - Legacy waveform for maximum compatibility with existing range ground equipment.  Premod filtering is built in, eliminating external filters.  •	SOQPSK-TG Modulation - Advanced Range Telemetry (ARTM) Tier I waveform delivers twice the spectral efficiency of PCM/FM.  SOQPSK-TG is fully interchangeable with FQPSK, but SOQPSK requires no intellectual property license.  •	Multi-h CPM Modulation - ARTM Tier II waveform delivers 2.5 times the spectral efficiency of PCM/FM.  •	Direct Digital Synthesis - Exceptional spectral purity, without spurious spectral lines due to I-Q modulator imbalances.  •	Automatic Data Rate Tracking - Accepts input clock at any rate from 1 Mbps to 20 Mbps, with no programming or configuration.  •	VCO-free Design - Immunity to shock and vibration, allowing application on platforms with severe dynamics.  •	Integral Randomizer - 15-stage LFSR, per IRIG 106.  Selectable for bypass or enable.  •	Integrated Programmable Clock Generator - Programmable clock with RS-422 output, for clocking external data device.  •	Common control interface for all three bands.  •	6 cubic inches, 2.00” (W) x 3.00” (L) x 1.00” (H)  •	10 watts RF output  •	Tuning ranges: 1435.5 MHz to 1534.5 MHz, 2200.5 MHz to 2389.5 MHz, 1755.0 MHz to 1850.0 MHz  •	Carrier frequency accuracy: ± 2.5 ppm over temperature Required features of the receivers: •	Complete Receiver – RF in to clock and data out, a single-box solution which accepts RF signals, and delivers baseband clock and data.  No external add-ons required.  •	Tuning ranges: 1435.5 MHz to 1534.5 MHz, 2200.5 MHz to 2389.5 MHz, 1755.0 MHz to 1850.0 MHz  •	True Trellis Demodulation in all ARTM Modes - Optimal performance for ARTM Tier 0, I and II is achieved only by trellis detection. Quasonix offers the only demodulator in the market which provides true trellis detection in all three modes.    •	3.5 dB Improvement in PCM/FM Performance - Second-generation multi-symbol demodulator improves BER performance by 3.5 dB over the best single-symbol demodulators, to within 0.2 dB of the theoretical limit.  •	Modulation Index Tracking for PCM/FM - Unlike first-generation multi-symbol demodulators, Quasonix’ design maintains its superior BER performance even if the received signal’s modulation index changes by up to ±15% (patent pending).  •	21 cubic inch package  •	Integrated Bit Synchronizer  •	Integrated De-Randomizer - Standard IRIG-106 fifteen-stage de-randomizer, selectable for bypass or enable.  •	Modulation types: ARTM Tier 0 (PCM/FM), ARTM Tier I (SOQPSK-TG), ARTM Tier II (ARTM CPM)  •	8 IF bandwidths: 250 kHz, 500 kHz, 1 MHz, 2 MHz, 4 MHz, 10 MHz, 20 MHz, 40 MHz.  Automatic selection based on modulation type and data rate, with manual override  •	Rapid Synchronization - Synchronizes up to 100 times faster – and maintains sync at lower signal-to-noise ratios – than other ARTM demodulators in the market.  •	Synchronization time, average - Tier 0:    250 bits @ 0 dB Eb/N0, Tier I:    385 bits @ 2 dB Eb/N0, Tier II:    2,800 bits @ 2 dB Eb/N0  •	Acquisition threshold	 Tier 0: -2 dB Eb/N0, Tier I: 0 dB Eb/N0, Tier II: 2 dB Eb/N0 Arcata intends to negotiate only, on a sole source basis, with Quasonix, LLC of West Chester, Ohio to acquire two (2) S-band, and Lower and Upper L-band flight qualified transmitters and receivers.  Quasonix has designed a complete airborne receiver with built-in demodulator and requires no external add-on in a very small package that easily used in the required platform.	Additionally, Quasonix's commercial product meets NASA's specifications without significant modification and cost so that availability will not impact mission schedule.  Any other product that will take more than 180 days to design, test, and deliver will impact the project schedule. Arcata intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  This solicitation is for supplies and services for which Arcata intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 6.302.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation by 4:00 PM PDT on June 21, 2006 which shall be considered by Arcata.  A determination by Arcata to not compete this solicitation is solely within the discretion of Arcata.   Responses received after this date will not be considered.  It is the interested firm’s responsibility to monitor this Internet site for the release of any amendments, and clarifying questions and answers.     No hard copy will be provided by this office. Oral communications are not acceptable in this response to this notice.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor’s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 22 June 2006, 5:00 P.M.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


STATEMENT OF WORK
ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST 
DAY USE

1.  INTRODUCTION/SCOPE

     A.  Background.  The Commander, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP), Portsmouth, VA, is responsible for providing the spiritual and religious care of patients and staff. BUMED provides chaplain billets to support this requirement. The Chaplain Corps provides chaplains to fill these billets at NMCP. 
     
     B.  Discussion.  The nature of pastoral care to Roman Catholics is sacramental. The celebration and administration of sacraments requires the presence of a Catholic priest. Therefore, it is essential that Catholic priests are available to provide pastoral care and sacraments to Roman Catholic patients and staff at NMCP. Traditionally, the Navy Chaplain Corps has been able to provide an adequate number of Catholic priests to fill billet requirements and care for the Roman Catholic population within the naval sea services. In recent years, a shortage of Catholic priests in the civilian community has developed. This shortage is now reflected in the decreased availability of Catholic chaplains in every branch of the military. It has been determined that only the two Regional Medical Centers in San Diego, Portsmouth, and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda will be detailed active duty Catholic priests.  Because of this shortage, gapping of the billets occur.  And, even when the Catholic billet is filled, it is essential to have a back-up priest available.  The priests assigned to the Tidewater Area are either with deploying units or are at large base chapels; they have not routinely been able to provide emergency coverage and will not be released, even temporarily, from their units to provide continuous pastoral care to our command.  Therefore, we need to implement new strategies to meet the spiritual and religious needs of Roman Catholics. This requires us to use Roman Catholic assets outside of the military.
 
     C.  Scope.  As a result of the above issues, a requirement exists to contract for the non-personal services of a Roman Catholic civilian priest to provide for the pastoral and sacramental needs of Roman Catholics at NMCP.

The NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office (NCBO) requires mapping and analytical support in relation to fisheries, habitat, oyster restoration, and marine debris project.  NCBO needs external support to develop a number of reports and products from those projects, as they are not currently represented by our current staff.  This support includes Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping and development, IT and networking support and guidance, database development, web programming and a thorough knowledge of Chesapeake Bay ecosystems and living resources.  The ability to integrate understanding of ecosystem processes with technical application is necessary.
NCBO utilizes a full suite of ESRI GIS mapping software, including Arc Map, Arc View, Geostatistical analysis.  Products must be developed using ESRI software, or complaint alternative.  NCBO needs to develop several web viewers to allow users access to data on various resources and projects, with the option to download data, as well as query the background databases.  These resources must address complex ecological issues and provide value-added analysis and products to the end-users.  For example, the oyster restoration project relies upon more than six long-term data sets.  NCBO needs all relevant oyster restoration and restoration monitoring data to be pulled into one database.  This will require significant interaction with data providers and NCBO staff.  Recommendation for consistent data collection and reporting formats should be developed for data providers, so that future data collection and analysis will be less difficult.  Subsequent to data collection and manipulation, an online viewer with several query options should be developed.  Options should include download, custom map creation, user queries on disease parameters at each site, and restoration effort by tributary and partner.  NCBO requires IT and networking guidance to maximize data transfer and daily operations among its four locations: Annapolis, Norfolk, Oxford, and Gloucester Point.  Supervisors for this contract are Gloucester Point, Virginia.  Currently, the offices have less than optimum inter-connectivity.  Network tests and research should be conducted to recommend the optimal solution between all offices.  This testing can take up to 6 months.  Options may include T1 installation, point-to-point VPN, or other configuration.  Network resources and bandwith concerns for all locations will be considered.  NCBO recently revised its entire website.  As we move our website from an independent server to a NOAA (.gov) server, there are several standardization and compliancy policies that need to be followed as we develop new tools and products for our website.  All products developed must meet current NOAA standards and follow all established internet policies.  All data must be accompanied by metadata and transferred, in entirely, to NCBO staff on a quarterly basis.  Additionally, applicants must be able to provide routine mapping support for NCBO staff, including custom maps for presentations, technical guidance on database development and management, database queries, and GIS support.  Deliverables:  1) Database management structure on NCBO server to include consistently developed Access databases for each major project (fisheries, habitat, oyster restoration, and marine debris), 2) Consistent reporting procedures and spatial and other data providers and grantees, 3) Recommendations to maximize efficiency of data transfer and access between the NCBO at VIMS office and other NCBO office locations, 4) Online web mapping interfaces and database query tools for fisheries, habitat, oyster restoration and marine debris project, 5) Online web interfaces will include data download tools, to include associated metadata and contact information for original data providers, 6) Online mapping tools must be developed with standard NCBO design guidelines, and be viewable among a variety of web viewers (Netscape, MS Internet Explorer, etc) and on various platforms (PC, Mac, etc), 7) Tools must be developed in collaboration with NCBO staff contact for each project, 8) Projects must also be developed in collaboration with our partner office, the Chesapeake Bay Office, and allow their web developers and spatial analyst to utilize the same databases used in our tools.  This will require implementation and maintenance of SDE with NCBO, 9) Stock map files for each of these projects with NCBO-standard design format.  These should be developed as easily accessed and printable maps for all NCBO staff at poster size (27x40) and page size (8.5 x 11).  Each file should be created with appropriate NCBO staff contact to provide background text, status, and other project specific information, 10) Connectivity recommendations for NCBO offices to maximize operations, and technical assistance in the implementation of these recommendations.  Period of Performance: October 1, 2006 – September 30, 2007 with possibility of extension for 2 subsequent years afterwards.  The resulting purchase order shall be negotiated on a firm fixed price.  The award shall be made on a best value basis using simplified acquisition procedures and commercial acquisition procedures.  Offers will be evaluated based upon approach, past performance, and price.  The solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Number 2005-08.

<DESC>Included in this amendment is the Performance Work Statement provided below.  Please review.  A copy of the Request for Quote (RFQ)is available in PDF form.  If interested in the RFQ please email Ms. Cassandra Caputo at cassandra.caputo@kirtland.af.mil with your contact infomation.

Open Innovation Support Services Performance Work Statement

Open Innovation is an emerging concept that taps into and utilizes the nation’s knowledge and technology to solve problems. In this model, problems are posed (by the Requestor, in this case the Air Force Research Laboratory or AFRL) to a network of experts (potential Sources) that can offer solutions. When a solution is provided, the Source is provided compensation by the Requestor for the solution.  Efficient methods to access these Sources of knowledge and solutions are a key to effectively implementing Open Innovation and realizing the benefits of this new paradigm. The current solicitation is for services to support the application of an Open Innovation framework for Air Force Research Laboratory, and the utilization of this framework for solving four (4) research problems. These problems will be focused and unambiguous problems that require specific research or technology solutions. Under CLIN 0001, the contractor will provide access to the infrastructure and services that provide the capability to tap into applicable knowledge and solutions, provide training and support for the development of four (4) appropriate problem statements and solution criteria suitable for use with that system, and act as an intermediary and screener between AFRL and those sources of knowledge/solutions that are submitted in response to problems. The contractor will present candidate Source’s knowledge/solutions to AFRL, and those that are deemed by AFRL to satisfactorily solve the problem will be considered a deliverable (see CLINs 0002-0005 below). These solutions are not proposals to develop the solutions, but actualizable hardware, software, data or plans that meet the intent and requirements of solving the problem statement. The contractor will provide support for allocation of intellectual property rights between AFRL and Sources, and will support the development of binding confidentiality agreements, if appropriate, or other arrangements to maintain the anonymity of either the Source and/or AFRL, if desired. 

The basic effort (CLIN 0001) covers all labor, training, travel, and fees for the management of the open innovation solution process as described above and will be for a duration of one year. The problem statements will be developed with support from contractor within 60 days of award, and will be posed to a network of Sources for the remaining duration of the contract, or until a period of time less than 1 year specified by AFRL has passed, or until successful solutions are obtained. Contractor shall provide monthly updates on the status (including number of responses and inquiries) of problem statements, and shall submit screened solution offers from Sources within 14 days of receipt. An overall final analysis report of total findings shall be provided to the Government after technical period of performance.

The four research problems will be determined after contract award, and will be associated with CLINs 0002-0005. These CLINs will be fixed price instruments for which payment will be provided upon successful delivery of a solution to one of these research problems.

TSA answer - TSA requires its contractors to take a number of courses that are offered over the internet via the TSA On-line Learning Center.  These courses cover a number of security related issues for TSA systems and well as TSA protected information.  Once a winning contractor is selected, the management team and the field chemists will provide information to TSA for vetting of their security clearance.  Once cleared, accounts for each person will be setup on the OLC.  Contractors are expected to logon to the OLC via the internet and complete the assigned course load.  The anticipated training should consume 40 hours annually, per person..

Also see 13 above.    

15.	C.3.1.1.1.d, page 7  During each performance period, when does the contractor receive the list of locations for the compliance assistance visits?

price proposal it will follow Section L instructions for preparation.  This would be included
under CLIN 00002 in a price proposal.   

23.	 Will TSA be defining specific ODCs to allow consistency in all bids?	

TSA answer - CLIN 00006 and its associated option year CLINs do define ODC’s.  

24.	With the airports being divided up by regions, are there specific area/region managers to coordinate Pick-ups? Or is the contractor  always in communication with the 350 Environmental Management Coordinators responsible for the 450+ airports?  

TSA answer - The contractor will be communicating with the Environmental Management Coordinators at the airport for pickups.   

25.	Is it possible to coordinate a site visit for selected contractors, who are invited back for oral's and pricing?  

TSA answer - Each airport is different: Category; operations; facility layout; volumes of materials abandoned and in need of management and disposal; number of personnel allotted to manage VAP; logistics for the pick-up process; and regulatory requirements.  TSA will not coordinate a site visit(s) prior to contract award.

26.	General: Section C.6 is not noted in the SIR; may we assume that  this section is not missing but that the section should be renumbered from C.1 through C.6 instead of through C.7

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted.

The due date for quotations, Friday, June 9, 2006, at 3:30 PM local time, remains unchanged.

QUESTION 1:  We generally use RMS for our measurements of noise, but the solicitation does not specifically state whether this criterion of 1nm (Requirement #3) is RMS or peak-to-peak.

RESPONSE #1: RMS is acceptable.

QUESTION #2:  In order to assess the need for heat sinking in the nanopositioning system (to draw heat away from the piezo actuator in a vacuum environment), it would be helpful to understand the intended duty cycle and the general operating frequencies to be used in that duty cycle.  

RESPONSE #2:  The intended use is quasi-static. The primary use of the actuator will be to perform step and hold motions. For instance, traversing a total distance of 2 microns by ramping 200 nm's at a time, where each ramp is followed by a hold of several seconds. Continuous cycling of the actuator through the full range of motion is not expected.  We may have applications where we employ dither signals of up to 100 Hz with an amplitude of a few nanometers.

QUESTION #3:  What communication protocol does the end user want to use to send the target position to the controller?  If they are going to use an analog-in line, we need to know the voltage range of that input signal.  We also need to know if the end user would prefer a GUI on a PC that can be used to set scan
parameters.

RESPONSE #3:  We are willing to work with vendors standard protocols. We can provide an analog signal of plus or minus 10 Volts. We can also work with GPIB.

QUESTION #4:  A point of clarification regarding first natural frequency ... We assume that the requirement is intended to mean that the first translational natural frequency on the output shall be at least 2000 Hz, i.e. the transfer function of the actuator will have a first resonance greater than 2000 Hz.  Is this a correct understanding of the requirement?

RESPONSE #4: That is correct.

QUESTION #5:  Regarding the requirement for vacuum compatibility ... Please explain the intended requirements for cleaning and packaging of the system prior to delivery.  We ask this because it has often been our experience that despite our efforts to provide a "clean" system, the end user will frequently handle the components in a non-clean fashion prior
to inserting the stage into the vacuum chamber.  Our standard process for vacuum-compatible stage systems is to completely wipe down the components with iso-propyl alcohol to remove most contaminants that would outgas in vacuum.  However, the final bake-in to burn off organic contaminants prior to use in vacuum has always been (in past systems we have delivered) the responsibility of the end user.  Please define the expectations in this regard.

RESPONSE #5:  We expect to receive a clean stage (all surfaces: an alcohol rub down is not usually sufficient to clean tapped holes) manufactured using materials compatible with operation in an environment of 1 micro Torr. The stage should arrive in a sealed bag to prevent contamination.

Baking of components is not necessary at this level of vacuum. Thorough cleaning using ultrasonic techniques and a combination of organic and inorganic solvents is sufficient.
