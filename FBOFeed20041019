<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration has a need to contract for legal advisory services for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Pursuant to the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA), Title I, Subtitle E, Chapter 1 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), Public Law 105-178 (23 U.S.C. 181-189), the Department of Transportation (DOT) is authorized to provide credit assistance to major surface transportation projects  including secured (direct) loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit to borrowers for major surface transportation projects and for up to 33% of eligible project costs.  Projects may include highway, transit, passenger rail and intermodal facilities.  Generally, under current law, project costs must equal or exceed $100 million. 

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on behalf of DOT, seeks to award several legal counsel advisory task order contracts to law firms with municipal bond and private lender expertise, including project finance experience, (with renewal options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the DOT) to provide advice and assistance to the TIFIA Joint Program Office (JPO) and Departmental operating agency counsel in reviewing, drafting, negotiating and modifying credit instruments including:  term sheets, as well as secured (direct) loan agreements, guaranteed loan agreements, line of credit agreements, and related documents including, lease agreements, pledge documents,  bond indentures, hedge agreements and swap termination documents as well as intercreditor agreements to be entered into between the DOT and selected TIFIA borrowers and third parties as appropriate.  Counsel may also review, draft, and modify amendments or amended and restated agreements. The contract will be for an initial two-year period with three (3) one-year renewal options.

 The firms selected will: provide advice and counsel to the DOT in analyzing the legal aspects of the financing for the project; review and modify as appropriate opinion letters of borrowers’ counsel; and ensure that credit agreement terms, conditions, covenants, and remedies provide adequate security to the DOT, are appropriate for the particular transaction, and are consistent with the statutory criteria and the regulations implementing the TIFIA program. The firm will also review all loan closing documentation and be responsible for or represent as appropriate the TIFIA JPO at financial close (generally held simultaneously with senior creditors) and may from time to time be required to furnish legal memoranda which would be incorporated into a briefing memoranda making recommendations with regard to the execution of the TIFIA credit agreement by the Department.

The firm must be able to attend working conferences and meetings at DOT headquarters in Washington, D.C. on short notice as well as participate in telephone conference calls on short notice.

It is anticipated that each law firm will be assigned one to three projects (task orders) annually, depending upon the number of TIFIA applications.  For each project/task order, the DOT will select one firm from among the multiple firms it retains to advise it on each transaction.


Extensive information on the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) can be accessed through the website http://www.tifia.fhwa.dot.gov/

The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC, Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), has a requirement for services for management, operation, and maintenance of aircraft located at GSFC/WFF. NASA/GSFC/WFF intends to issue a Request for Proposal on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) - "Only One Responsible Source", to Dyncorp Technical Services, 6500 W Freeway, Fort Worth, TX  76116 for a 2-month extension, December 1, 2004 through January 31, 2005, with four 1-month option periods through May 31, 2005, under Contract NAS5-00026. The proposed aviation support is necessary for continued aviation support services at GSFC/WFF.  The current aviation services contract is scheduled to expire on November 30, 2004.  The proposed extension will allow for completion of the solicitation and award of the new WFF Aircraft Support Services Contract.  Competition of this contract extension is not practicable due to the short duration of the services period.  The award of this extension to other than the incumbent would likely result in the disruption of services since this contract requires the contractor to supply services such as certified air traffic control tower operators that require 30 days to certify and other technically specific activities of required maintenance actions on the B-200 aircraft. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 3, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Request for Information submission date has been extended from October 22, 2004 to October 29, 2004.  

Request for Information

Crime in the United States Data Driven Website

This synopsis is issued for informational and planning purposes only!  The GPO/FBI seeks a proposal for the creation of dynamic database driven web site based on the data from Crime in the United States publication.  The goal of this web site is to allow the user to search the data and to create custom tables.  Alternative displays of data such as graphs and color-coded maps might also be helpful to the user. Each table in Crime in the United States is focused on a different type of data and each would need a custom search.  (Note: because of the way data is recorded, comparisons across tables is not possible)

Background

Crime in the United States, a publication of the FBI, Uniform Crime Reporting program, is an annual comprehensive statistical publication produced from data from over 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States.  It is a compiles volume and rate of crime offenses for the nation, the states, and individual agencies. This report also includes arrest, clearance, and law enforcement employee data. Historically this data has been published as a printed book and recently the data has been available on the internet as PDF, HTML, and Microsoft excel format.  HTML web edition of the 2002 Crime in the United States is http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_02/html/web/index.html.

Examples

The following are websites that already have taken some crime data and created a data driven website.  

Bureau of Justice Statistics
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/

Easy Access to FBI Arrest Statistics
http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/ojstatbb/ezaucr/

Easy Access to the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports
http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/ojstatbb/ezashr/


Website requirements

•	US Section 508 compliant
•	Website can be viewed across platforms not requiring a specialized plugin
•	All pages would have a printer friendly format
•	Data can be updated from year to year by different vendors or FBI
•	Data can be exported into XML or other future friendly format
•	Search system is modular and may be updated by different vendors
•	Administrator can easily log in and change numbers when needed through a web interface


Data from previous years

HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Excel files from Crime in the United States, 2002:
http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/02cius.htm

Materials to be furnished by contractor to GPO/FBI

•	Information on how to complete this project:

Description
Sample Screenshots (Very Basic Layout)
Database technologies to be used

•	Estimate of cost
•	Samples of web work
•	General information about company

Interested firms are hereby requested to submit a capability statement (10 pages or less and no marketing material) that addresses their ability to perform the services described above and identifies the company’s point of contact.  Interested parties should respond by October 29, 2004.  Send responses to John Tobiason, United States Government Printing Office, 732 north Capitol Street, NW, Washington DC 20401, Stop: CSCS, Room C-846.  E-mail your questions to John Tobiason at jtobiason@gpo.gov


The following are responses to questions submitted to the Government:

When submitting a capability statement, can we email it to you or does it need to be mailed?

All submissions to Program950s2004 should be mailed to John Tobiason, United States Government Printing Office, 732 North Capitol Street, NW, Washington DC, 20401, Stop: CSCS, Room C-846. Interested parties should respond by October 29, 2004.     


Does the 10 page limit include everything, technical discussion, cost estimate, and samples?

The 10 page or less limit is only for the capability statement. All supporting pages including screen shots, technical information, and cost estimates can be contained on additional pages.


Are we expected to provide resumes of key proposed staff, and if so, will they be excluded from the page limitation?

There is no expectation to provide resumes, but if included they can be considered supporting material.


Should the maps be able to drill through the underlying source data?

Any technology that would expand the meaning of the data will be taken into consideration.


One of the 'Website Requirements' is: 'Website can be viewed across platforms not requiring a specialized plug-in.' Do the contract officers consider ArcReader (map display freeware) a specialized plug-in?

Any suggestions of plugin technology would be helpful and information on what the website would gain and limitations because the plugin would also be helpful.


Will maps be needed for all possible tables or just for a subset of tables?

Any creative/interactive display of the data such as maps and graphs would be a helpful recommendation as well as the technology that one would use to create it and display it.


Does the Government plan on hosting this application internally, externally, or are you looking for suggestions?

The Government is looking for suggestions on hosting options.


Is there a database structure already in place for some of this data and if so, what platform (SQL Server, Oracle, etc.)?

The data is only available from excel files.


The cost estimate that the govt. is looking for - is it for a Time & Materiel effort OR a fixed-price effort?

We are currently looking for a fixed-price effort estimate.


I would like to find out if the GPO has a web development technology the prefer such that our proposal fits into the overall IT direction of the GPO?

This job is for the FBi being administered by the GPO, neither party has a preference and is looking for suggestions/best options.

Does the GPO only want a capability statement or do they want a proposal as well? (the synopsis seems to imply both)

The GPO/FBI is looking for information on how to complete the project.

In what form will the data (spreadsheet, XML document, tabbed-delimited text file, etc.) be provided to us to insert into the database?

All data is in excel/spreadsheet file format.


Will we be able to utilize the raw data as reported by the 17,000 law enforcement agencies in generating website content?

No, the data will be provided by FBI in excel spreadsheet format.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 712190   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-05-00015, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through  Federal Acquisition Circular 01-25.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 712190, which has a size standard of $6.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the  award of this  solicitation. This procurement is for the contractor to perform detailed fish vouchering services to verify and validate the taxonomic identification of aquatic vertebrates from samples collected in U.S. western streams and rivers and preserve portions of the samples as permanent archival records  for future reference and use in a scientific/fish museum.  The period of performance will be from the date of award through September 30, 2005. EMAP has collected aquatic vertebrate (fish and amphibian) voucher samples from ca. 1200 stream and river sites in the 12 western states over the period  2000-2003. These vouchers have been identified and archived at the Smithsonian Institution. Although originally envisioned as a four-year sampling effort, EMAP's western pilot will require a fifth field season in the summer of 2004.  During the fall of 2004, the contractor receiving this award  will accept shipment of preserved voucher specimens of aquatic vertebrates from the Southwest, Northwest and Plains stream and river sites. Samples will be provided to the contractor by EPA's Western Ecology Division (WED). WED will provide a computer file of site locations and other pertinent  information to the contractor to facilitate developing a permanent catalog record of the voucher specimens submitted for archival. Requirement: Southwest - Preserved voucher specimens of aquatic vertebrates from approximately 60 stream and river sites in the states of Arizona, Nevada, California,  and Utah will be provided.  EPA anticipates generating approximately 5 voucher samples (multiple individuals/sample) for each of the ca. 60 sites sampled in 2004,  for a  total of ca. 300 vouchers (or samples) requiring identification and archiving. Northwest - Preserved voucher specimens of  aquatic vertebrates from approximately 60 stream and river sites in the states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho will be provided.  EPA anticipates generating approximately 5 voucher samples (multiple individuals/sample) for each of the ca. 60 sites sampled in 2004, for a  total of ca. 300 vouchers  (or samples) requiring identification and archiving. Plains - Preserved voucher specimens of aquatic vertebrates from approximately 80 stream and river sites in the states of Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota and Colorado will be provided.  EPA anticipates generating approximately 5  voucher samples (multiple individuals/sample) for each of the ca. 80 sites sampled in 2004, for a  total  of ca. 400 vouchers (or samples) requiring identification and archiving. TASKS:  Task 1: Identify voucher specimens to species for all adults and juveniles. Where large numbers of small,  difficult to identify (or hybridized) individuals are collected, subsampling and reporting percentage species composition is acceptable.  Prepare and deliver summary reports (as described in Deliverables) to WED within 3 months of receipt of the voucher specimens. Catalog and archive the voucher  specimens in the permanent collection. Task 2: Examine photographs of large specimens to verify species identification.  Typically, easy-to identify game fish will not be included in voucher collections, but will be photographed and returned to the stream alive.  Prepare and deliver summary reports  (as described in Deliverables) to WED  within 4 months of receipt of the photographs. Specimens will be preserved in the field in 10% borate-buffered formalin. Two types of aquatic vertebrate samples may be collected.  Voucher samples contain selected specimens of individuals identified and  counted in the field; they provide a record of what was collected in the field and released   Unknown samples contain specimens that could not be confidently identified in the field.  The contractor shall transfer specimens to alcohol for permanent storage.  In general, both voucher and unknown  specimens will be limited to small fish (juveniles, small adults) and amphibians, so as not to be a space burden.  The contractor may request to WED in advance that additional specimens be preserved.  Each putative species will be placed in a separate mesh bag with a numbered tag by the field  crews.  The species identified by the contractor from the bag must be linked back to that specific tag number for each site so that WED can link each voucher species with a unique tag number.  This number, in turn, can be linked to species identified on field sheets, whether or not they were  correctly field-identified, and whether or not the bag contained more than one species.  In addition, these species identifications can be used to infer proportional abundances of released fish species in the field collections.  It is critical that this chain of identification be maintained.   Following standard museum practices, the contractor shall archive the specimens in their permanent collection.  After seven years, the contractor may dispose of large specimens after notifying and receiving approval from WED. The contractor's collection  must be located in a climate controlled  environment in order to ensure sample integrity. The contractor must have a permanent computerized catalog database, with daily backups in order to assure long-term sample tracking and data retrieval. Samples must be stored in sealed jars in 70-75% ethanol OR isopropanol on shelves. Jars should  contain permanent museum labels (preferably printed on waterproof paper with indelible printer ink.  Hand written labels are acceptable.) Disposal of any hazardous waste (e.g., formalin, ethanol or isoproponal) is the responsibility of the contractor. The contractor shall submit a reference list of  taxonomic keys to be used in the identification of aquatic vertebrates from this project for approval by EPA.  If supplemental references are required, it is the responsibility of the  contractor to acquire them.  When the contractor staff encounters a specimen with which it has little experience,  it is expected that the curatorial staff will seek expert opinion on verification of the identification. Deliverables: The following reports shall be submitted: 1. The contractor shall provide an electronic (any common database is acceptable) and hardcopy report on species identifications and  counts by sample type (voucher vs. unknowns) for each stream sampling event (stream-date combination) and tag number.  Where subsampling techniques are used, counts of the group from which the subsample is drawn and counts of the identified subsample shall be reported by sample type, sampling event  and tag number.  Hybrids shall be identified to the lowest taxonomic level reasonable, and probable crosses identified. Both  electronic and hardcopy files shall be provided to WED within 3 months of receipt of voucher specimens or photographs.  Final reporting of difficult specimens and hybrids  may be delayed to allow for specimens to be exchanged with taxonomic experts at other locations. 2. The collection data shall be entered into the contractor's catalog/data system.  One set of hard copies of these data shall be sent to WED for review with Deliverable #1. The following FAR provisions  apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items.

<DESC>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION - Direct questions or concerns to Edith Butler(202) 619-0422.
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for General Aviation Turboprop Aircraft With Six Or More Passenger Seats.
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for General Aviation Turboprop Aircraft With Six Or More Passenger Seats. The basis for waivers is that no small business manufacturers are supplying these classes of products to the Federal government.  The effect of a waiver would be to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and sources must be submitted on or before November 5, 2004.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 481-1788; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act, (Act)15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product.  
This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.406 (b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR 121.1204, in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding systems.  The first coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The second is the Product and Service Code established by the Federal Procurement Data System. 
     The SBA received a request on September 7, 2004 to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for General Aviation Turboprop Aircraft With Six Or More Passenger Seats.  In response, SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for General Aviation Turboprop Aircraft With Six Or More Passenger Seats, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 336411.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule for this NAICS code. 
AUTHORITY:  15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as required delivery dates, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal, who meets the government’s required delivery dates, will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

<DESC>****Reason for this modification to FEDBIZOPPS notice is as follows: 
Delete:  “Communication and interfacing: The instrument should provide reliable, low-cost, low-power, real-time full-duplex ASCII data transmission via an inductive modem compatible with the Seabird Electronics, Inc.” 

Add:  “Communication and interfacing: The instrument should provide reliable, low-cost, low-power, real-time half-duplex  ASCII data transmission via an inductive modem compatible with the Seabird Electronics, Inc.” 

NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) requires ATLAS 3rd Generation Sensors, to replace existing instrumentation on PMEL’S NX ATLAS moorings. PMEL desires five configurations, four of which, TM, TPM, TCM and TVM, will require First Article Testing. The new subsurface instrumentation shall be small, self-contained data loggers that sample and store data at pre-determined intervals independent of other sensors or the buoy electronics. The instruments are high-accuracy temperature modules (TM) with non-volatile memory and built-in inductive modem. These modules would also have optional configurations to measure water pressure (TPM) or high-accuracy conductivity (TCM, for the computation of salinity), and a stand-alone inductive modem (SM) with external serial RS-232 interface for in-situ direct cable interconnection with other instrumentation. Additionally a high-accuracy temperature current meter (TVM) with non-volatile memory and built-in inductive modem is desired.  Overall lifecycle cost is a strong consideration, since these instruments will be used in arrays of moorings in remote locations.  The instruments shall be: (1) TM – temperature, inductive modem; (2)TPM – temperature, pressure, inductive modem; (3) TCM – temperature, conductivity, inductive modem; (4)TVM – temperature, current meter, inductive modem (5) SM – External RS-232 serial interface, inductive modem. Communication and interfacing: The instrument should provide reliable, low-cost, low-power, real-time full-duplex ASCII data transmission via an inductive modem compatible with the Seabird Electronics, Inc., DPSK (differential-phase-shift-keyed) protocol, using a single, plastic-coated, mooring cable or insulated wire. The modem and inductive coil are to be integral to the instrument. User-selectable (on pre-deployment) operating modes include:  Polled: On command, the modules takes one or more samples and transmits the data along with a time stamp; Autonomous: The modules sample data at pre-programmed intervals, storing the data in FLASH memory; Combo: Data at pre-programmed intervals is stored in FLASH memory and the SIM can request the last stored data with time stamp; Averaging (Continuous or Burst): Data at pre-programmed intervals is stored in FLASH memory. The SIM can periodically request the average (with time stamp) of the individual data stored since its last request. The period of performance will begin on date of contract award for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract type and will continue for five years. A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation may be available on or about November 16, 2004, through this website.  The approx. closing date may be 30 days after issuance of the RFP.

<DESC>After review of the proposals received in response to the subject RFP, we have determined that we must cancel the solicitation and reissue it with modifications. We failed to receive an adequate number of qualified offers to make the number of multiple awards the program requires to work properly. Our analysis of the responses received, and comments from potential offerors have led us to the conclusion that many qualified firms decided not to participate because of some of the proposed contract terms, and others who did propose would have to be disqualified unnecessarily.

We will reconsider our requirements, redraft and reissue the RFP shortly. As is required, we will post the announcement and the RFP on the FedBizOpps website.

We regret having to take this action, and very much appreciate the interest in working with us on this program shown by a number of firms.

The General Services Administration (GSA) is in the process of requesting Proposals (RFP) for renovations to the Federal Building / Post Office  located at 657 Second Avenue North, Fargo, North Dakota.  GSA is soliciting contractors to participate in the “Best Value Source Selection” process for this project.  This process has been set aside for procurement under the Small Business Administration’s 8(a) Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Step One requires the offeror and major subcontractors (Electrical only) to submit a technical proposal, without pricing.  Each Offeror must be a general contractor, and each offeror must submit between two (2) and four (4) major subcontractors. Following evaluation of the Technical Proposals, the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) shall make a Competitive Range determination that will include all offerors considered to have a reasonable probability of being selected for award.  All  offerors will be allowed to continue in the Source Selection process, however, those that fall outside of the competitive range will be notified that the SSEB has determined that they do not have a reasonable probability of award.  Step Two of this procedure will require the submission of priced proposals and management plans.  Following a final evaluation of the Price and management proposals, the SSEB shall determine which offeror to award the contract to based upon its Best Value analysis.

The following is a brief description of the construction.  This project consists of all labor, equipment, material, transportation, and supervision necessary to complete this renovation.  The building was constructed in Fargo in 1969 and contains 4 stories, a basement, and a penthouse and provides a gross area of 24,121 square meters (259,635 square feet) to house approximately 404 employees.  There are 31 structured parking spaces within the building and 115 surface parking spaces in a lot adjacent to the building.  The major tenant in this building is the U.S. Postal Service, occupying 45% of the building.  Other tenants include the Internal Revenue Service, Small Business Administration, Social Security Administration, Congressional Offices, and GSA operations.  The General Construction Contractor shall be professionally licensed in the State of North Dakota.  The project will generally consist of the following scope of work: major upgrade of the electrical system, repair and replace elevators, replace and re-grade paving, complete window replacement, fire protection upgrade, handicapped accessibility upgrades, security enhancements, interior alterations, exterior façade repairs, and improvements to the postal dock.  Warranties/guarantees, finishes and related management requirements will be included.  Portions of the work, especially in occupied tenant spaces, will have to be performed during non-working hours.  Total project construction costs, including all designated Government allowances, are estimated to be in the range of $5 Million to $6 Million.  The design was prepared by the architectural firm of ACLP Architecture of Denver, Colorado.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is publicizing Amendment 0001 to sources sought synopsis N00178-04-Q-3048 posted on 13 August 2004.   This amendment hereby amends the sources sought synopsis to a competitive small business set-aside acquisition to determine prospective small businesses capable of providing Scientific and Engineering Support for Directed Energy Technology Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) for NSWCDD Code B20.  This Amendment hereby extends the date for submission of capabilities statements by qualified small businesses to 1 November 2004.  Capable small businesses shall also identify if they are currently a team member under any multiple award contract vehicles such as a GSA Multiple Award Schedule contract, NAVSEA’s Seaport E contract, etc.  All other requirements of the synopsis remain the same and are hereby restated in their entirety. This synopsis amendment is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. Overview:  NSWCDD directed energy support encompassed within this sources sought is focused on high power microwave (HPM) / radio frequency (RF) and high energy laser (HEL) technologies with the objective to improve the Navy’s near- and far-term airborne, surface, subsurface, and space warfare capabilities through the utilization of this transformational technology.  With advances in reliant technologies and Navy interest in the all-electric ship concept, directed energy technologies are beginning to be considered for an increased role to satisfy Navy mission requirements in both blue water and littoral environments.  The application of advanced directed energy technologies will be tested with hardware based upon foundational research and development characterized by “hands-on” prototyping made possible through theoretical calculations, laboratory experimentation, and computerized modeling and simulation.  The technologies will then be assessed with static and dynamic labora! tory and field tests to demonstrate potential feasibility.  To be considered a potential source, the contractor must be able to provide scientific and engineering support for the design, test, and performance evaluation of HPM / RF systems and subsystems, and HEL lethality design, test, and performance evaluation to support blue water and littoral missions for the Navy.  Labor Requirements:  The current labor support required as part of this sources sought can be categorized as 80% HPM / RF-related and 20% HEL related.  This percentage is expected to remain equivalent for the near-term.  Specific contractor personnel support should include, but not be limited to, the following full-time equivalent areas of expertise (manning levels to be used for initial planning purposes only are annotated in parenthesis): senior HPM / RF / pulse power engineer (1); senior HPM / RF / pulse power electronics technician (2); mid-level HPM / RF / pulse power engineer (2); mid-level HPM / RF / ! pulse power electronics technician (3); mid-level senior electromagnetic modeling and simulation physicist / engineer (2); senior electro-optics / laser engineer (1); mid-level electro-optics / laser technician (2); mid-level mechanical engineer (1); mid-level network and computing engineer (1).  Task Requirements:  The contractor tasks shall provide support to NSWCDD technicians, scientists, and engineers in various task areas to include threat analysis, system analysis, RF / HEL systems design and development, RF / HEL system test and evaluation, automated data collection and analysis, physics-based computer modeling and simulation design and development, and setup / maintenance / operations of both indoor laboratories and outdoors experimental test ranges.  Support of unique expertise associated with the development and analyses of directed energy technologies may be needed.  Evaluation of candidate system and subsystem performance analyses will be conducted in both stati! c and dynamic laboratory and field site environments, as well as the development of system models and computerized simulation capabilities in order to evaluate performance in a cost-effective manner.  The evaluation of various system performance techniques will require the use and development of specialized commercial and custom devices, technologies, and methods, to include applications in the areas of RF / HEL sources, calibration equipment and facilities, high-bandwidth electromagnetically tolerant diagnostic instrumentation, software and hardware based data acquisition systems, and high-speed image acquisition and processing systems.  The contractor shall calibrate, operate, and maintain these complex devices, systems, and facilities and perform detailed data reduction and analysis.  The contractor shall assist with the selection, development, and integration of measurement platforms.  Field exercises could be conducted in a variety of international locations, but the ma! jority will be located within the continental United States.  Virtually all of the support contractor personnel work tasks are expected to be conducted on-site at NSWCDD, Dahlgren VA.  The contractor shall provide technical and engineering support for the evaluation of emerging technologies for potential systems and subsystems.  The contractor shall participate in test planning and utilize computerized simulation capabilities to predict testing outcomes.  The contractor shall provide technical and engineering support in the analysis of test results, support technical evaluation of the test results, and report on the test results.  The contractor shall provide technical and system engineering support for analyses and investigations, and provide input to NSWCDD to support the preparation and updating of program documentation.  This includes analysis of proposed system or equipment changes; recommended changes to documentation; and analysis of technical, operational, cost, risk! , and schedule factors in support of program reporting requirements.  The contractor will need to acquire some hardware (with the Government providing the remainder), as well as design and fabricate components and subsystems required to conduct the assigned tasks.  The hardware required for supporting test and evaluation tasks shall include data acquisition and storage systems as well as electrical or mechanical fixtures to interface system or test equipment to land, ship, or airborne platforms.  For planning purposes, the approximate percentage of tasks assigned with this contract is two-thirds services-related and one-third hardware-related.  The contractor shall be required to operate in specialized classified environments that require security clearances up to the Top Secret level.  Scope of Effort:  The contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (term and completion) pricing arrangement with a period of p! erformance of five (5) years comprised of approximately fifteen (15) man-years total.  Work is planned to begin in March 2005.  Criteria:  Responses should address, as a minimum, the following criteria: (1) demonstrated experience and qualifications of personnel relevant to the proposed tasks, identifying key and supporting personnel, and their previous research and accomplishments on similar or closely related projects; (2) demonstrated ability to obtain security clearances at the time of contract award for all personnel expected to provide contractor support in accordance with the above requirements; (3) demonstrated current corporate in-house experience in providing directed energy RDT&E support services to include system and subsystem design and integration; data collection, reduction, and analyses; modeling and simulation; and laboratory and field test planning, operations, and evaluations; and (4) expected percentage of effort, if any, to be subcontracted and whether 8! (a), small, or large businesses will be used.  Experience must include demonstrated capabilities to understand issues associated with Navy system development and evaluation, and the roles / relationships of military laboratory and field activities supporting such activities.  Responses:  All interested small businesses are invited to provide a capabilities statement which contains, at a minimum, the following: (1) a concise discussion of the company’s technical understanding of the major issues relating to directed energy as discussed above, (2) a summary of previous corporate experience relevant to the above criteria obtained within at least the last five years (more is preferred) together with applicable Government contract numbers and Government technical and contract points of contact with current telephone numbers (applicable experience gained through performance on a subcontract can be substituted for and/or can supplement prime contractor experience if necessary), (3)!  an overview of company personnel (by labor category) expected to be assigned to a resultant contract, (4) a corporate roadmap on how labor categories not currently fulfilled by existing company personnel plan to be filled by the contract award date, (5) any potential subcontracting arrangements being considered at this time, (6) statement as to the existence of a corporate DCAA-approved accounting system for cost-type contracts or evidence of the ability to obtain DCAA approval by the contract award date, and (7) statement as to the existence of a corporate make-or-buy plan or plans to develop one by the contract award date.  If subcontracting is contemplated, the capabilities statement shall contain sufficient information concerning the planned subcontracting arrangements to assure the Government that the limitations in FAR 52.219-14 can be met.  These limitations require that at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel will be expended for empl! oyees of the prime contractor.  The submitted capabilities statement is not to exceed twenty (20) double-spaced, single-sided pages.  Small businesses determined to be most capable based on a review of the capabilities statements may be asked to provide a capabilities briefing not to exceed two hours to NSWCDD staff at NSWCDD, which will be used to supplement the written capabilities statement.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN POSTPONED INDEFINITELY.  NO FURTHER ACTION WILL BE TAKEN ON THIS EFFORT BY NAVAIR ORLANDO TRAINING SYSTEMS DIVISION.
NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to the Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI), Columbus, Ohio, for the design and fabrication of one Whole System Live Agent Testing (WSLAT) fixture.  Under the proposed contract, BMI will design the WSLAT fixture and then fabricate it inside the existing Material Test Facility (MTF) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  The WSLAT fixture will be used to challenge the Joint Biological Point Detector System (JBPDS) to confirm its ability to identify a select group of live biological agents. The JBPDS is the first DoD detector system that has been required to have the complete system challenged by live agents before it will be approved for Full Rate Production (FRP), imposed by a memorandum from the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E).  The WSLAT fixture will have inner dimensions large enough to be able to house a complete JBPDS system (approximately 42 inches wide, 16 inches deep , and 58 inches tall) and will disseminate and contain up to BL-3 live biological agents.  The WSLAT system is being proposed to address the immediate need imposed by the DOT&E for the JBPDS program.  The proposed WSLAT system will be self contained in the Closed System Chamber room of the MTF at DPG.  The anticipated period of performance is 24 months with an estimated value of $14.2M.  Only BMI possesses the unique knowledge and experience required for the type of technology necessary to design and fabricate the WSLAT system.

TO:		Prospective Proposers

RE:	Craiova II Sulfur Dioxide Reduction Project Feasibility Study
	Reference No. 0470023B

SUBJECT:	Amendment to the Request for Proposals

DATE:	Monday, October 18, 2004

This announcement serves to inform prospective proposers on the above-referenced project about amendments to the subject Request for Proposals (RFP).

Amendment No. 1:  The deadline for the submissions of proposals has been extended.  Proposals should be submitted in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. Local Time– (Bucharest GMT+2), November 5, 2004.

Amendment No. 2:  The following supplemental background information is provided for clarification of section 1.1 of the RFP.   

The following questions have arisen during the RFP process, which require clarification: (1) what is the composition of the limestone available in the area near the Craiova II plant; (2) has the Grantee considered options for flue gas desulfurization (FGD) other than limestone base wet FGD, such as ammonium sulfate or dry FGD; and (3) has the Grantee considered producing wallboard grade gypsum instead of mixing the FGD product with the ash?  The Grantee’s response is as follows: “The answers to the above questions should be provided in the Feasibility Study.  The main goal of the Feasibility Study is to determine: (1) the best option regarding the FGD procedure in order to allow the TPP to meet EU environmental protection requirements; (2) the economic and financial feasibility of the project; and (3) the main measures which could contribute to improve the economic parameters of the project.” 

The following information also supplements the Note in section 1.1.

The Institute for Studies and Power Engineering (ISPE) is the general designer of the Craiova II Thermal Power Plant (TPP) and also for the majority of TPPs in Romania.  ISPE is also the general designer of the Romanian National Power Grid.  Considering ISPE’s role in the design of the TPP, and the company’s experience in electricity and heat production in Romania, the Grantee has stated that ISPE can be one of the possible local subcontractors for the Craiova II Sulfur Dioxide Reduction Project.  In terms of ISPE’s experience with FGD, ISPE is the current local consultant for the FGD implementation at TPP Turceni and TPP Rovinari, which are two of the largest TPP facilities in Romania. The Contractor may wish to subcontract with ISPE in order to fulfill the Terms of Reference for this Study.

If the Contractor should wish to contact the Institute for Studies and Power Engineering (ISPE) in order to respond to this RFP, the correct contact information is as follows:

Mrs. Carmencita Constantin
Head of Studies and International Programs Department
ISPE
Phone: 40-21-206-1266
Fax: 40-21-210-2457
E-mail: cconstantin@ispe.ro

Please make note of the change in Amendment No.1 and be aware of the additional information provided in Amendment No. 2.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Teaming Opportunity for the Instrument incubator Program (IIP) NRA which was posted on September 28, 2004. You are notified that the following additional technical requirements are added. Technical POC: Chris Hostetler, (757)864-5373, email, Chris.A.Hostetler@nasa.gov We are considering a proposal to develop a laser system that will function as a lidar transmitter for both (1) UV ozone differential absorption lidar (DIAL) measurements and (2) High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) measurements.  The proposal will be in response to the current Instrument Incubator Announcement, and the transmitter technologies developed under this proposed effort must show a path to future space and unpiloted aerial vehicle (UAV) applications.   We are interested in partnering with others that have technical expertise in either or both of the following capabilities. 1) Develop, test and deliver a diode pumped, conductively cooled Nd:YAG laser system that is seeded to produce tunable, single longitudinal mode output.  2) Develop, test and deliver a UV converter module that would accept the 355nm output from a pump laser and efficiently convert it to tunable UV radiation in either of two wavelength bands 308-320 nm or 285-311 nm to produce both the online and offline wavelength pair.  Both the pump laser and UV converter would be integrated into an existing lidar system for deployment and testing on a pressurized aircraft.  The due date for responses is extended to October 29, 2004.

<CONTACT>Kristin Engelken, 309-782-3491
<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Conference scheduled for 1 December 2004 The Army Field Support Command intends to competitively solicit from the private sector an operating arrangement that will achieve the following objectives:   A.	Reserve, at all times, the nation's ability to produce and/or procure its Warfighters' primary service ammunition, 5.56mm, 7.62mm and .50 Caliber in its primary configurations, ball, traced and blank.  B.	Obtain the critical provisions to support the military missions.  It is a National imperative to maintain the ability to acquire small caliber ammunition in an environment where projected requirements are expected to increase for the foreseeable future.   Increasing military contingencies have created a situation where the capability to produce small caliber ammunition through conventional methods have been fully exercised.  A Second Source Prime Contractor for Small Caliber Ammunition is anticipated to r emedy the current situation by arranging for capability to deliver up to 300 million rounds per year for a five-year period to the U.S. Government.  Quantities could increase up to 500 million per year. The AFSC is seeking sources interested in the Second Source Prime Contractor concept.  To that extent, the Army intends to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), anticipated in January 2005.  A competitive award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for  establishment of the Second Source Prime Contractor, followed by Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders for small caliber ammunition, with the source that provides the best value proposal to the formal RFP is anticipated.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Technology Service, Rocky Mountain Region, Denver, CO, intends to acquire work-life and employee assistance program services on behalf of the Department of Defense, Under Secretary of Defense (ODUSD), Military Community and Family Policy.   This Request for Information seeks the opinions and suggestions of both large and small businesses on the most efficient and effective methodology to acquire and deliver these services while optimizing small business participation.   The services support the Military OneSource program which provides 3 million members of the Armed Forces and their families, at locations worldwide, with access to a broad array of information and counseling services through the internet, telephone, and e-mail.   This program must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   The contractor will interact with the client community, furnishing referrals to information and services through a call center or on-line service.   The contractor is required to maintain a database of employee assistance providers which will then be utilized to refer military clients to the appropriate service provider through internet based tools or through master consultants staffing the call center.   The contractor is required to field calls for assistance with issues such as substance abuse, emotional well being including suicide, health and wellness, disability, legal, financial, elder care, parenting and child care, education services, relocation, Tri-care, and general every day issues.   The contractor must also provide a Nurse Line.    Service providers must be able to refer clients to military provided services and resources.   In addition, be able to inform military authorities of a crisis situation.   The military population must have one number/address to use to reach the service providers no matter where they or their family members are located.   Face-to-face counseling services will be limited to 6 per issue, and when these services are required in overseas locations, they will be provided by US citizens.   Travel from the US to overseas locations will be reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulations.

The services are currently provided under a teaming arrangement between two large businesses under a task order against two Federal Supply Schedules, Human Resource Management and Management, Organization, and Business Improvement Services.   A new contract must replace this order by February 2005.   It is anticipated that a draft solicitation will be issued in November 2004.   

Please respond with a brief, informal paper addressing some or all of the following questions:  Is it feasible to set-aside all or a portion of these services for small business?   Does a small business have the resources and capacity to manage a program of this magnitude (please expand on this topic)?   If a small business set-aside is pursued, would the small business be able to provide a network of providers worldwide and still adhere to the limitation on subcontracting of 50% (50% of the work must be performed by the contractor’s own employees)?   If a recommendation is to divide the employee population into smaller contract portions, perhaps geographically, how would separate contractors interact with each other to provide the military population with uninterrupted, quality service?    If there are multiple contractors, how would a family that is separated by distance or is disbursed temporarily over several locations easily access services, and how would data on their cases be maintained or shared?   What type of quality oversight is the industry practice?    How would that oversight be accomplished with multiple small business contract holders?   If your recommendation is that the procurement not be set-aside for small business, how do you envision a program of this size being managed while achieving the greatest utilization of small businesses?   Small businesses are invited to also provide a description of their firm’s capabilities.

Responses can be sent in writing before November 5 by e-mail to FTS R10 Acquisition@gsa.gov.    Response sent via US Postal Service can be address to Ms. Jeny Pomber 10TQ, GSA FTS, 400 15th Street SW, Auburn, WA 98001.   Questions or concerns may also be sent in writing to Jeny.Pomber@gsa.gov.

After review of the responses to this synopsis, a solicitation announcement will be published in FEDBIZOPPS and the NAVFAC E-sol website.  No solicitation is currently available.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation announcement at a later time.  The resulting solicitation (if any) will be for a Firm Fixed Price, contract for Energy Savings Technology Validation Services.  The majority of the work is located within the continental United States.  The anticipated contract will be awarded for a base year and three (3) one year options.  The maximum value of the base year and all options is $20,000,000.00.

The purpose of this contract is to install and evaluate newer, commercially available, cutting edge energy saving technologies for the U.S. Navy.  The work associated with this contract is for the planning, design-and-development, installation or construction, commissioning, monitoring and operational and maintenance support for energy saving hardware, equipment, and systems specified by the Government.  The awarded contract shall provide operation and maintenance support for the hardware, equipment, and systems for the first year of performance after commissioning has been completed.

 It is anticipated that there will be a minimum of two (2) installations of six (6) different technologies per year for a minimum of twelve (12) total demonstration projects per year at twelve (12) separate facilities.   Simultaneous support at a minimum of four (4) separate sites involving four (4) different technologies is necessary

The scope of this contract will include the planning, design-and-development, construction or installation, commissioning, monitoring, operational-and-maintenance support, and removal-and-disposal of the following technologies, systems, hardware, and equipment:

     Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, Direct Digital Controls (DDC) – facilities management systems, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Domestic Hot Water Heating Systems, Lighting Systems, Steam Condensate Systems, Boiler Plant Modifications, Weatherization (improving the thermal envelope of a building), Energy Recovery Systems, Electrical Energy Systems (increasing the energy efficiency of an electrical device or system or reducing cost by reducing peak demand), Renewable Energy Systems, Other Energy Consuming Systems utilized by the Navy.
     The Government may order demonstrations of other energy-savings technologies not cited here

The work involves determining the parameters to monitor for each technology to ensure that the equipment meets operational requirements and design a monitoring system that monitors those parameters.  This will include but not be limited to performance, energy savings and system availability.  

The work includes the ability to design and install a monitoring system for each installation.  The ability to perform detailed scientific monitoring and analysis of the installed technology in order to prove whether or not the installed technology does in fact save energy and does not have any other negative attributes such as increased maintenance or environmental considerations is tantamount to the success of subject work.  Prior experience with data collection, analysis, conclusion gathering and report writing is mandatory.

The monitoring system shall be designed such that risk of failure of any part of the monitoring system during the data acquisition period is minimal.  In order to eliminate the consequences of individual parts of the monitoring system failing, redundant parts may be required.  Commercial grade trending and control systems generally will not be acceptable.  The monitoring period may be up to one year in duration.  The monitoring system must have the capability to automatically download data from a remote location.  Monitoring may include baseline monitoring of the existing system.  The work will consist of initially analyzing the recorded data a minimum of once per day until it is verified the system is operating properly.  After the system is operating properly, a minimum of weekly monitoring during the monitoring period is necessary to ensure both the technology being monitored and the monitoring system continue to operate properly.  If any part of the monitoring system fails, the monitoring system shall be repaired (at no additional cost to the government) and operating within three days of detection of a failure.  Parameters to be monitored may include but not be limited to:

     Electrical power, Electrical energy, Steam flow, Condensate flow, Cooling load, Temperatures, Flow rates, Humidity, Solar heat gain, Heat flux, Albedo, Electrical harmonics, Electrical power factor, Pressure, Differential pressure, RPM, Exhaust emissions

<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to man-made or natural disasters. In 2002, HHS established the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP). This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population. The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for response to a public health emergency. *** DESCRIPTION *** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. The Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), also referred to as radiation sickness, is an acute illness caused by irradiation of the entire or a significant portion of the body by a high dose of penetrating radiation in a relatively short time period (minutes).  This exposure results in the depletion of hematopoetic stem cells and progenitors, resulting in severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  Severe neutropenia can significantly increase an individual’s susceptibility to lethal infections, while thrombocytopenia increases the risk of hemorrhage.  Currently there are no approved therapeutics to mitigate ARS.   The Government has an interest in identifying sources of therapeutics likely to be effective in preventing or reducing the development of neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia when administered at times after acute exposure to radiation.  The Government is particularly interested in identifying therapeutics that are effective when given several hours to days after exposure.    Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nation’s bioterrorism defense needs. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS. Submitted information should include: a) a description of the product including relevant chemical, physical chemical or immunological characteristics; b) a description of the mechanism of action of the product; c) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; d) a statement of the proposed indications for use; e) a statement of the proposed production process and the current state of validation or GMP compliance; f) an estimate of production capacity and timelines, and estimated cost; g) a product development plan for GMP production, animal and human studies; and h) the overall stage of product development including the current status of preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies. All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. Information must be submitted by December 20, 2004. Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and can be e-mailed to the attention of the technical contact person: Marissa A. Miller, DVM, MPH, ORDC, Phone 202/690-6013, email Marissa.Miller@hhs.gov. Please ensure that at least TWO (2) COPIES of all responses are submitted: one to the technical contact person, Marissa A. Miller, and one to the primary contracting point of contact, D. Andre Early. 

Under provisions laid out in the Project BioShield Act of 2004, future competition may be limited to sources responding to this request for information (Sec. 319F-2(c)(7)(C)(vii) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d-6b).

<DESC>The US Army Office of the Project Management for Maneuver Ammunition Systems (MAS) has a need for a propellant with reduced sensitivity/vulnerability that is environmentally friendly to replace the current propellant utilized in the propulsion system for 120mm tank training ammunition cartridges fired from the M256 Cannon.  This requirement is restricted to National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB), however, if a manufacturer is outside the NTIB, a plan must be submitted showing how the propellant will be produced within the NTIB. A propulsion system with the following characteristics is needed in order to meet specific performance requirements: The propellant must have an increasing temperature profile or velocity across all temperatures (ambient, cold, and hot).  The propellant must have a charge loading density greater than or equal to .9 g/cc.  The new propellant must be no worse than M14 propellant in wear and erosion with the M256 cannon on the M1A1/A2 Abrams tanks.  However, this current propellant contains certain hazardous ingredients, which the USA wants to eliminate to meet the new environmental requirements.  In addition, the current propellant does not pass the insensitive munitions IM test per Mil-Std -2105C.  The replacement propellant will be required to pass all of the IM tests per Mil-Std-2105C.  The replacement propellant must also eliminate or as a minimum greatly reduce the amount of residual solvents present in the final product.  These propellants must be affordable, environmentally friendly, easy to demilitarize, and compatible with the existing US ignition system.  	Furthermore, it must also be compatible with the combustible cartridge case material and all components currently used with the existing US tank munitions. The following are the requirements.    	Manufacturing operations must be capable of supporting deliverables on the order of 5 million pounds per year.  The interested party is to submit (1) performance characteristics and mechanical properties, (2) information, if available, data on full scale test firings (3) statement of current propellant manufacturing capabilities, a description of their experience with the propellant, and an analysis to identify any additional skills, equipment, and/or technologies that are required in order to produce the propellant quantities noted above.

<SUBJECT>99 -- CCR PROCEDURES
<DESC>CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION

Dal 1 Ottobre 2004, onde poter partecipare agli appalti del Contracting Office, e’ obbligatorio registrarsi presso il Central Contractor Registration, pena l’impossibilita’ di assegnare, da parte dell’ufficio preposto, ordini e contratti alle ditte che ne fossero sprovviste.

Di seguito, la procedura per la registrazione:

1) Ottenere un codice Dun & Bradstreet.
Per ottenerlo, bisogna visitare il sito web www.dnb.com , cliccare su “Get
a D-U-N-S number only”, compilare il modulo e seguire le istruzioni. 

2) Ottenere un codice NCAGE (NATO Commercial and Governmental
Entity).
Per ottenerlo, è necessario connettersi all`indirizzo web
http://www.dlis.dla.mil/Forms/Form_AC135.asp

3) Ottenere la registrazione CCR (Central Contractors Registration).
Una volta in possesso dei codici DUNS e NCAGE, è possibile registrare la
propria società per partecipare alle gare. 
Il sito da visitare è www.ccr.gov ; una volta connessi, cliccare su “Start
new registration”, inserire il proprio “DUNS number”, completare i
moduli con i dati richiesti nei campi obbligatori, e completare la registrazione.

N.B. Una volta registrata, la società passerà al vaglio PPIMS (Past Performance
Information Management System), che consiste in un controllo su eventuali
appalti che la società abbia già ottenuto dal Contracting Office.
Una società che chiede la registrazione CCR, e che abbia avuto problemi
nell`esecuzione di contratti stipulati in precedenza col Contracting Office, sarà
inserita nella lista ELPS (Exclude Party List System), e non sarà ammessa a
partecipare a future gare.

COME TROVARE I BANDI DI GARA
Le società registrate non inserite nella lista ELPS possono partecipare a tutte le
gare pubblicizzate sul sito dell’Amministrazione statunitense
www.fedbizopps.gov 

N.B. Cliccando in alto a destra su “Vendor Notification Service” è possibile
iscriversi gratuitamente al servizio di informazioni sui bandi di gara. Una volta
iscritti, si riceveranno automaticamente informazioni al proprio indirizzo di posta
elettronica ogni volta che una gara viene bandita .
Da “Vendor notification service” si accede alla pagina
http://www2.eps.gov/EPSVendorRegistration.html , dove l’opzione numero 2
porta alla pagina http://www2.eps.gov/servlet/VendorReg (è questo il percorso
consigliato).
A questo punto, si può decidere se ricevere informazioni su tutte le gare bandite
oppure soltanto su quelle relative a determinati settori: in quest’ultimo
caso, va indicato il settore d`interesse selezionando uno dei campi sotto la
dicitura “Select Procurement Classification Code”. Se, per esempio, si opera nel
settore della fornitura di pompe e compressori, si dovrà selezionare il campo
numero 43-Pumps & compressors. In alternativa, si possono selezionare tutti i
settori.
Le richieste d`offerta sono in genere chiamate “Solicitations”, e la procedura per
l`aggiudicazione è grosso modo la stessa già indicata per le gare.
Il bando (“solicitation” o “tender”) fornisce tutte le informazioni necessarie alla
formulazione dell`offerta e indica la persona (contact person) cui indirizzare
eventuali richieste di chiarimenti.
Si consiglia di tenere in conto due circostanze; i tempi previsti per la ricezione
delle offerte possono essere molto ristretti, ed i bandi vengono frequentemente
modificati (in questo caso, viene pubblicato sul sito un Amendment, seguito dal
codice alfanumerico che è stato attribuito ad ogni singola gara).
Infine, va sottolineato che talvolta non si tratta di vere e proprie gare, ma di inviti
a manifestare l`interesse ad uno specifico progetto, che in seguito si cercherà di
finanziare. 
Non dimenticate che i tempi di fornitura o di realizzazione del progetto
sono essenziali per il successo della vostra proposta.

<SUBJECT>J -- Provide Tower Space and Maintenance Services for the NOAA Weather Radio System in the State of New Mexico
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/ National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS) to negotiate with the State of New Mexico, General Service Department, Office of Communications, located at P.O. Drawer 26110, Santa Fe, NM  87502 for tower space and preventative and remedial maintenance of NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) transmitters, antennae and transmission lines located at eight (8) State of New Mexico owned tower sites located in New Mexico in Albuquerque, Clovis, Ruidoso, Des Moines, Hobbs, Farmington, Las Cruces and Santa Fe.  BACKGROUND: In a January 1975 White House Policy Statement, NOAA’s NWR was designated the sole government operated radio alert system to provide direct warnings into private homes for both natural disasters and nuclear attack. The mandate requires uninterrupted transmission capability 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Since 1994, the State of New Mexico has had access to NWR service through successive contracts between the NOAA/NWS and the State of New Mexico. SCOPE: This procurement is for a follow-on contract for tower space and maintenance services.     PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contract to be negotiated is for a one year base period of performance, followed by four 1-year option periods for a total of 5 years. SOLE SOURCE: NOAA/NWS has determined that the State of New Mexico is the only contractor that can provide 1) tower space on strategically located towers and allow for placement of antennas at the needed heights to provide the required NWR broadcast service coverage. 2) The State of New Mexico is the only contractor that can provide the 24 hours per day, 365 days per year maintenance services since no other contractor can have access to the towers and equipment for maintenance after hours due to Homeland Security issues.

<SUBJECT>A -- Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology Program (IHPRPT), Advanced Rocket Propulsion Plans (ARPP)
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.  The Government is interested in obtaining information from industry in the form of ARPPs regarding how future goals for the IHPRPT program may be met.  The propulsion application areas of interest are Boost and Orbit Transfer Propulsion (including propulsion efforts of Technology for the Sustainment of Strategic Systems (TSSS) IPT), Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion mission application areas.  The baseline data and goal summary information is included in the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT), Request for Information (RFI) supplemental package for the mission application areas relative to the IHPRPT efforts.  A contractor who currently does not have an ARPP, but wishes to respond to the RFI must as a minimum, generate an ARPP that will satisfy all IHPRPT goals applicable to at least one propulsion system type within an application area.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The IHPRPT program is in its ninth year of a fifteen-year plan.  The program continues to be a vital Department of Defense/National Aeronautics and Space Administration (DoD/NASA) and industry effort.  IHPRPT was established to strengthen the technology base of the DoD and commercial rocket propulsion systems through the development of advanced, innovative rocket propulsion technology.  The achievement of the IHPRPT time-phased rocket propulsion technology goals, once transitioned to full-scale systems will fulfill DoD/NASA and commercial needs to meet propulsion system performance, operability and cost needs for near-term and far-term missions.  An important part of the IHPRPT process is receiving technical planning information from industry in the form of ARPPs.  Through this RFI we will receive updated or new ARPPs.

The IHPRPT program is a DoD/NASA/industry coordinated effort to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies by the year 2010 that will permit a doubling of rocket propulsion capabilities over the 1993 state-of-the-art technology.  The program is structured in three phases, with nominal completion dates by calendar years 2000, 2005, and 2010.  The information provided through the Advanced Rocket Propulsion Plans (ARPPs) will be used to review and revise the Government Rocket Propulsion Plan (GRPP) and to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.  A review team comprised of DoD and the NASA representatives will review ARPPs submitted by the United States (U.S.) Rocket Propulsion Industry on these mission application areas.  U.S. Rocket Propulsion Industry companies who participate in this program must develop or update ARPPs mapping out their recent past, on-going and future rocket propulsion research and development (R&D) efforts, consistent with the IHPRPT program goals. 

Those who have not previously been associated with the IHPRPT program should be aware of the following:  The IHPRPT program will involve technology acquisitions that have military or space applications and are subject to Air Force Materiel Command FAR supplement, Subpart 5327.90, Foreign Disclosure.  In addition, foreign owned or influenced firms and foreign governments will not be allowed to participate as prime contractors.  Only U.S. contractors who are registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and have a legitimate business purpose or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors will have access to the IHPRPT RFI supplemental package containing restricted information.  If you are registered in the CCR, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the supplemental package.  To receive a copy of the IHPRPT RFI supplemental package; please contact Mr. Drew DeGeorge, AFRL/PRS, (661) 275-5713.  Submitters are advised that representatives from DoD and NASA, as well as employees of Aerospace Corporation; SPARTA Inc.; Spiral Inc.; Sverdrup, Inc.; Nyma Inc.; Centech Group Inc.; ERC Inc. and others may assist the government as advisors in reviewing the ARPPs.  The government will ensure the required non-disclosure agreements are in place prior to allowing the support contractors to review the ARPPs.  Any objection to the disclosure of information to these non-government advisors should be provided in writing BEFORE the date set for receipt of documents and shall include a detailed statement for the basis of the objection.  The government will provide written comments to each contractor specifically in the following areas: completeness, strengths, weaknesses, cost and probability of successful completion (program management and technical approach).  The comments will be based on the following: Does the ARPP address all the IHPRPT goals within all the phases of the selected mission application area(s)?  What are the strengths and weaknesses?  Is this a viable plan and do the projects integrate together toward a demonstration of simultaneous goal achievement?  Does the ARPP contain all the information requested in the RFI and Supplemental Package?  Is the ARPP clear, concise and well organized?  Reviews of the ARPPs will be scheduled to occur at each respective responder’s facility.

The ARPP shall describe in detail the contractor's plan for full achievement of all the time-phased goals for each proposed propulsion system type within an application area(s); Boost and Orbit Transfer, Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion.  The contractor may propose work in one or all application areas, but must address all goals (referenced in the supplemental package) and phases within any proposed application area for each type of propulsion system.  New, innovative concepts and processes are encouraged.  It is the intent of the government to issue a call for ARPPs on a biannual basis.

We request you send copies of your ARPP to each of the principle government organizations participating in the review.  They are listed as followed with the preferred number of copies, addressee and address.  Please send eight copies of each response to Mr. Drew DeGeorge, AFRL/PRS, 5 Pollux Drive, Building 8353, Room 216A, Edwards AFB CA 93524-7048.

Proposal for Implementing Painting Contractor Certification Program (PCCP)
Background.
Historically, the Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCA) has been plagued with pre-mature coating failures on surfaces deemed “critical-coated” surfaces i.e. bilges, u/w body surfaces, potable water tanks, flight deck surfaces, etc…Such coating failures typically lead to a loss of cutter operational days and increase contract costs.  When confronting pre-mature coating failures, in most cases, MLCA is dealing with “mom-and-pop” type shipyards; sadly, as a result of careful investigating, these failures are often attributed to a lack of Quality Control (QC) in said yards.
What we have done and are doing.
MLCA has attempted to remedy this problem by including a variety in-process quality control requirements in coating specifications; in addition, over the past 5 years, one of our main efforts has been that of requiring contractors to hire Technical Representatives/Coating Inspectors, who are professionally trained (at a minimum), to the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) coating Inspector Session I., to oversee all aspects of critical coating applications.  Unfortunately, due in part to the difficulty of enforcement in the field, this effort has been, largely, unsuccessful.  An additional contributing factor is contractor use of free technical services from coating manufactures - a practice recently prohibited in our specifications.
What we propose as a next step.
As is currently required by NAVSEA and various other major facility owners, the next logical step, in addressing this problem, is to require contractor certification.  In our view, the Painting Contractor Certification Programs (PCCP), developed and managed by the Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC), would be the appropriate certifying medium.  The SSPC programs are based on consensus standards developed by a diverse committee of industry professionals; they are nationally recognized independent contractor evaluation programs.  They are also a handy pre-qualification tool for facility owners and others who hire industrial painting contractors.  Among several of the certification programs, the “QP-1” program, at a minimum, involves reviewing the painting contractors’ primary ability to provide quality work (surface preparation and protective coating application), and assessing contractor conformance with applicable safety, health and environmental compliance standards.
Certification particulars.
Initial certification costs are between $5000 and $7500; annual renewal is required at a minimal cost to the contractor.  Consequences for certified contractors who violate established safety, quality, environmental, and or ethical practice standards of performance include (but are not limited to) the following:  warnings, probationary periods, suspensions or revocation of certification by the SSPC.
Enforcing the PCCP requirements.
The MLCA recognizes the importance of maintaining a broad contractor base.  In fact, as part of the PCCP implementation, we would actively engage contractors by providing advance notification of intent to use the “QP-1” program as a qualifying factor.  Specifically, all prospective bidders for preservation work for the aforementioned critical-coated surfaces could expect advance notice of six months to one year - to facilitate their compliance efforts.  The notice would read was follows:
”Notice To Contractors:  This is to advise all concerned parties that all Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCA) commercial availability projects advertised on or after 01 October 2004 will require that any contractors engaged in surface preparation and coating application be certified by SSPC to the requirements of SSPC-QP 1, prior to contract award.   The MLCA retains the option of including these requirements in any projects advertised prior to the listed date above.  Information on the SSPC certification programs can be found at www.sspc.org”.
The vessel procurement branch (vpl) would enforce the PCCP requirements in a manner that is fair and equitable.  Rules for certification and re-certification have been established by SSPC to provide a reasonable amount of time for all parties to perform the required tasks; however, SSPC can provide temporary extensions where "good-faith" efforts have not succeeded in fulfilling all requirements.  The policy of enforcement of the basic PCCP requirement, initially, and for fostering continuous certification would be as follows:
·	Contractors would be allowed to work during their certification period only.
·	Upon expiration of the certification, work would be stopped and would re-start only upon presentation of a valid certification, or written certification extension, from SSPC.
·	No grace period would be allowed and liquidated damages would not be waived for non-performance due to expired certification.
Placing Requirement for PCCP in Project Specification.
At the time of implementation, the “General Requirements” item would be amended with a paragraph that conveys the intent of PCCP implementation; it would read as follows:
“All contractors and subcontractors that perform surface preparation or coating application shall be certified by the Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC) to the requirements of SSPC QP 1 prior to contract award, and shall remain certified while accomplishing any surface preparation or coating application.  The painting contractors and painting subcontractors must remain so certified for the duration of the project.  If a contractors’ or subcontractors’ certification expires, the contractor will not be allowed to perform any work until the certification has been reissued.  Requests for extension of time for any delay to the completion of the project due to an inactive certification will not be considered and liquidated damages will apply. Notify the KO of any change in contractor certification status”.
Conclusion.
The SSPC certification programs would offer the MLCA the advantage of knowing that the industrial painting contractors who are working on its projects have the experience, knowledge and equipment to produce quality work in accordance with the local, state and federal guidelines for safety, health and environmental compliance.

<SUBJECT>--MARKET SURVEY #TAR-AMPS-05-1 Combat Vehicle Electrical Power Management
<DESC>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is i t a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on inf ormation requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. The U.S. Army Tank  automotive and Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Electronics Architecture Team requests Remote Power Management information for the Advanced Mobile integrated Power System (AMPS) Science and Technology Objective (STO). This information may be used for the evaluation and prototyping of a Smart Power Architecture for ground combat vehicles. The vehicular power system of current army vehicles has been taken for granted.  The systems were designed to fit only a single production iteration of the vehicle.  The ability to efficiently and cost effectively reengineer the power system for additional  iterations or variants does not exist today.  While current vehicles have replaceable parts, they are not a one for one part replacement/exchange through out the system.  Future Vehicles will require a modular power system. New subsystems will require higher power density and multiple operating voltages through out the system.  Army soldiers require longer silent watch durations, in which the engine is not running, while st ill maintaining an array of functional subsystems. While it is important that the modules themselves are interchangeable it is also important that the placement of power bus be flexible.  It is essential that placement of the remote modules not be constrai ned by a big bulky power cables that must be accommodated by the placement of other components inside the vehicle.   POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT FOR Advanced Mobile Power Systems power bus structure: The power bus must be able to support multiple voltages. The power bus must include a ground return and not rely on the chassis as the return path. The power bus must be able to handle up to 400A continuous over the entire expected voltage range of 14V  4 2V. The power bus must be able to handle Military specifications for shock, vibration, temperature, and corrosion.  The power bus must allow for easy placement of modules and replacement of sections of the power bus.  RATIONALE:  Provides for commonality of power bus segments.  Although each family of combat vehicles are structured differently, from a logistics stand point a common bus increases maintainability.  This bus structure will allow smooth transitions from 28V to 42V as p arts become common. POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT FOR Advanced Mobile Power Systems remote switching module: The remote switching power module must be modular in design. The remote switching module must be able to operate at 14V, 28V, and 42V. The output state (on, off) must be controllable remotely. The status of each load (on, off, opened, shorted) of the modul e must be available remotely. The Trip current must be programmable and remotely reset-able. The power module must protect against short circuits. The module must have the ability to parallel load outputs for high current applications. RATIONALE: Provides for modular power distribution. Provides the ability to migrate high current loads to 42V bus. Provides the ability to intelligently manage loads and provide graceful load shedding. The remote status provides the ability to perform diagnostics and  prognostics. RESPONSES DUE: Responses to the Market Survey are requested no later than November 23, 2004. RESPONSE FORMAT(S ): ELECTRONIC.  Electronic responses are preferred and strongly encouraged.  It is requested that electronic responses be provided in any of the following format:  Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint, Adobe Portable Document Format.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.
