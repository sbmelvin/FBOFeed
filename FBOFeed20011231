<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is planning to participate in the second phase of the NASA Earth System Science Pathfinder (ESSP) Project competition by submitting a Step 2 proposal for the design, construction, and collection of data from a bathymetric altimeter to map the Earth's ocean floor by using a precision radar altimeter from the International Space Station (ISS).  The ABYSS (Altimetric BathymetrY from Surface Slopes) mission will map the ocean floor 100 times faster and cheaper than ships can, by using a state-of-the-art radar altimeter on board the International Space Station to detect subtle tilts in the ocean surface caused by seafloor topography below.  These data are required to make accurate forecast of global climate change, because seafloor topography and roughness control the circulation and mixing of heat through the ocean, and only 0.1% of the deep ocean has been mapped in enough detail so far.  ABYSS will uncover more than 80% of the ocean in just a few years, revealing the details of the plate tectonic process, improving the accuracy of assessments of the offshore resources, and furnishing marine environmental and inertial navigation data.  A previous Step 1 proposal for the ABYSS project was prepared by a team of scientists from NOAA and Johns Hopkins University/Applies Physics Laboratory, Brown University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, Ohio State University, Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California at San Diego, SOEST of the University of Hawaii, Tulane University, University of South Florida, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.  The Step 1 proposal was evaluated by NASA and approved for Step 2, which requires submission of detailed technical, management and cost proposals for the ABYSS project.  The Step 2 proposal is being prepared by the ABYSS project team and will be submitted to NASA on February 4, 2002 for ESSP evaluation, with project selection decisions expected from NASA in July 2002.  If selected by NASA, the first phase of ABYSS mission work will be Concept Studies to be performed jointly by NOAA with assistance from the ABYSS project team participants under contracts to NOAA.  The period of performance for this phase of the work will be approximately three months.  Competitive solicitation documents are not available.  Other interested parties may submit a capability statement to the address herein, providing details regarding your capability to support the ABYSS project mission outlined above.  Any responses received will be considered and the findings will be provided to responding interested sources.

<DESC>ELECTRONIC RFP ANNOUNCEMENT.  (POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.)  

ANNUAL RESOLICITATION OF RECORD LINKAGE MASTER AGREEMENT (N01-CP-01003-13)	

The Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute (NCI) is interested in expanding their existing pool of Master Agreement holders for "Record Linkage Studies Utilizing Resources in Population-Based Tumor Registries".  The NCI desires to contract with population-based tumor registries in order to collaborate in the conduct of record-linkage and subsequent analytical investigations.  The main tasks in support of the record-linkage studies include: developing a study plan; developing or applying appropriate record-linkage procedures to link a population file with the cancer registry files; evaluating results from the record-linkage study; providing results of the record-linkage study to the NCI in the form of a computer file with appropriate documentation of record format and variables used; developing record-keeping procedures to maintain filing systems of all relevant material; and monitoring performance and providing written technical and financial reports as required under a subsequent Master Agreement Order.  Optional capabilities include providing biologic specimens and providing access to other existing computerized registries that have been or could be linked to the cancer registry.  Offerors will be evaluated on their qualification as a population-based cancer registry including their knowledge of the population at risk; ability to provide completeness of ascertainment of incident cancer cases in the population; validity of classification and coding of all cancer cases; procedures used for case follow-up; ability to provide five-year cancer incidence data; ability to maintain data in a secure environment; and qualifications and experience of the registry and personnel.  In addition, offerors will be evaluated on their technical response to a sample master agreement order on a hypothetical record-linkage study.  

The Master Agreement contract mechanism is a pre-qualification to enable qualified sources to compete for and perform future contracts, which will be awarded based on Request for Proposals (RFPs).  Master Agreements (MA) will be awarded to all offerors whose technical proposal is determined to be acceptable.  The initial Master Agreement award is non-monetary and is exclusively for the purpose of establishing a pool of contractors who are qualified to perform services for epidemiologic studies of cancer using the resources of population-based tumor registries.  The obligation of funds shall be accomplished solely through the award of a contract.  Each MA holder will be eligible to compete for future contract awards for record-linkage studies.  Each MA holder who is also determined to be qualified to provide the optional biospecimen component and/or the ability to link other population-based registries to their cancer registry will be eligible to compete for those types of orders as well.  Current MA holders who are currently not eligible to compete for the biospecimen component or ability to link to other population-based registries component, may submit additional clarifying information which will be reviewed to determine technical acceptability for those options.  MA holders who choose to compete for future Master Agreement Orders will be selected based on technical merit, budgetary considerations and other factors.  All responsible sources meeting these criteria are encouraged to submit a proposal and will be considered by the NCI.  All proposals should reference N01-CP-01003-13.

It is anticipated that the solicitation package will be available electronically on or about January 15, 2002.  The RFP may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home Page by using the following internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/, then Click on "Current Requests for P

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

Projects assigned to the IDIQ contract(s) use the Solution Order Concepts approach to scope and price the work.  After award of the initial contract(s), each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505 (b)(2).  Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order and may be competed on the basis of price, best value or technically acceptable, low-price selection procedures.  The subsequent task orders may be performance oriented tasks requiring minimal design, may occasionally be complex construction requiring design development for design-build construction or a combination of both.  They will be scoped by the Government/Contractor Team and may not have traditional plans and specifications but may include sketches, and requests for catalog cuts, and other submittals.  The salient requirements of the task order will be scoped by the Government/Contractor Team, in order to develop a mutually agreed upon Statement of Work.  The awarded task order will be performance scoped, firm fixed price task with a specific completion date.  Should any of the IDIQ Contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded a task order.

<DESC>The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), the federal statistical agency for the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), is seeking sources to design, cognitively test, implement, and process a planned new study entitled, "2002 National Study of Transportation Use by Persons With Disabilities."  The planned study will be by mailout of paper questionnaires, and due to the unique sample, respondents will have a choice of response mechanisms: to complete the paper questionnaire and mail it back; to access the questionnaire by Internet and provide on-line responses; or to access the questionnaire by telephone and provide touch-tone or audio responses (or other modes of data collection as recommended).  The Government anticipates an initial mailout plus one (or two) followup mailouts to nonrespondents.  Depending upon the overall response rates and available funding, BTS may invoke optional tasks to attempt contact with remaining nonrespondents by telephone or by personal visit.

The Government will provide the study questions.  The selected Contractor will be expected to develop or procure a nationally representative probability sample of persons with disabilities as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act; design and draw the samples for the cognitive tests and the actual data collection effort; design the format of the paper questionnaire, develop Internet and telephone questionnaires identical to the paper version, and assemble and mail the questionnaires; key/scan questionnaire responses; conduct telephone followup if instructed; conduct personal visit followup if instructed; integrate data collected from all data collection modes into a single data file; process (edit and clean) data; inflate the sample data to make national estimates; generate frequency counts with associated standard errors; prepare documentation which covers all methodological aspects of the study.

The most important activities, and the ones that will be given the most emphasis during a competitive procurement process, if a competition is conducted, will be the capability of the contractor to develop or procure a nationally representative probability sample of persons with disabilities, and to develop procedures for maximizing the overall response rate of the mail study. 

Offerors interested in documenting their capability to perform this study should respond to this announcement by January 23, 2002. The following specific information is requested: 1) company descriptive literature; 2) description of how contractor expects to develop or procure a nationally representative probability sample of persons with disabilities, and how that sample conforms to a probability design; 3) experience conducting surveys and studies by mail, Internet, telephone, and in person; 4) description of overall study methodology; 5) description of methods used to maximize data quality (including maximizing response rate), and 6) estimation of survey response rates for the mailout phase, the optional telephone followup phase, and the optional personal visit followup phase.  Offerors should be aware that persons with disabilities comprise a unique and rare subpopulation to survey, and should address this fact in responding to the above requested information.
 
Documentation should be sent to Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Attn: Sharon Durant, 400 Seventh Street S.W., Room 3430, Washington, D.C. 20590. Questions may be referred to Sharon Durant at 202-366-0649 or by E-mail at Sharon.Durant@bts.gov. 

The purpose of this synopsis is to identify capable, potential responsible sources only and does not constitute an RFP nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information provided will be evaluated to identify capable potential sources if funding is allocated for this effort. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for any information solicited.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)/Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS/JPO) is seeking partners to foster the development of the Standards Boulevard.  The Standards Boulevard, ("Boulevard") is a new initiative that requires the participation and support of the vendor community to fully achieve its desired objectives of informing and educating the transportation community about ITS standards.

The purpose of this Request for Partner Proposals (RFPP) is to introduce the Standards Boulevard Program to the vendor community, to describe how the Boulevard is envisioned to operate in the short- and long-term, and to provide information about how a vendor can apply to become a Standards Boulevard partner. (NOTE:  Download this solicitation in its entirety for the complete RFPP and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).

The JPO believes that the Boulevard will provide a mechanism through which the U.S. DOT and the vendor community can accomplish complementary goals. A greater understanding of ITS standards and the solutions ITS can offer to the transportation community will lead to a greater demand for ITS products and services. 

Your interest in this proposal is most welcomed by the ITS/JPO. All interested parties should submit their proposal in accordance with the attached RFPP.  The MOU and RFPP and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the Electronic Posting System (EPS) under FedBizOpps at www.eps.gov.  Choose the "EPS for Vendors" option followed by selection of the DOT/FHWA section.  The related documents will be posted under RFQ number DTFH61-02-Q-00020.  
Note:  This is a request for partnership and contribution of resources. This solicitation will not result in a funded contract. This solicitation encourages collaboration rather than competition.  

The JPO acknowledges the unique nature of the RFPP and the contributions being sought, and is eager to work with the vendor community to craft Boulevard partnerships. The deadline for submitting a proposal is January 25, 2002. Given the short timeframe for Boulevard development, as soon as your firm determines interest, please call Jim Allen at the number below. 
Questions regarding the RFPP should also be directed to:

Private bidding may occur between a government buyer and multiple suppliers (one to many) or between multiple government buyers with common commodity needs and multiple suppliers (many to many). A many-to-many private bid will require the consent of the government buyers. With either configuration, the government buyer's common commodity needs may be aggregated into lots by commodity type. Based on the uniqueness of these lots, there may be more than one private bid lot with each private bid lot having its own set of suppliers. The following describes basic capabilities of Reverse Auction components that allow a single government buyer to interact with multiple sellers to conduct a reverse auction. The system shall allow the government buyer via the Enabler to perform certain critical functions. These functions include the ability to monitor auctions in progress, analyze information on buyers and sellers, and create management and other reports. The Buyers.Gov Exchange portal intends to provide an interface for Reverse Auction services.  Hosted Reverse Auction: is one in which a great deal of planning, coordination, and execution on the part of the enabler (auctioneer) is required in order to execute the auction.  Typically, it means interfacing with personnel at an auction control center in order to execute the event. Desktop Reverse Auction: is that in which the auction is set up and executed entirely from the users desktop as opposed to interfacing with personnel at an auction operations center for set up and execution of the event.
