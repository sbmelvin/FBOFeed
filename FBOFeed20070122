The goal of the CSFM is to facilitate civil society to make greater and more effective contributions to the goals and priorities outlined in the National Strategic Plan (NSP) for HIV/AIDS, the National Strategic Programme Plan of Implementation (NSPPI) for OVC and the Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP) II for HIV/AIDS, Malaria and TB.  The purpose of the CSFM is to attract joint funds and disburse them swiftly and efficiently to civil society organizations to enable scaled up and effective comprehensive responses to HIV/AIDS, OVC, TB and Malaria. The CSFM allows for decision-making and allocation of collective resources based on analysis of gaps and local priorities, and is supposed to reduce the administrative burdens on both donors and civil society partners. 
  
This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The authorized geographic code for this activity is 935. 
 
This RFP is expected to be issued o/a February 5, 2007 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) website.

All questions regarding this solicitation should be directed through the mechanism provided on the FedBizOpps website.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract to Icy Passage Fish, P.O. Box 57, Gustavus, Alaska 99826.  Icy Passage Fish will provide research vessel charter services  in support of National Park Service harbor seal research program.  This includes providing a vessel charter support, (fuel, meals and lodging for 11 passengers), and associated technical expertise in April and September 2007 (up to one 10-day trip in April and September) to facilitate the safe capture and handling of harbor seals in Glacier Bay National Park in southeastern Alaska.  The port of departure will be Auke Bay, Juneau, Alaska. This firm has provided vessel charter support in previous research excursions under the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.  This up-coming charter is a follow on to the previous charter for the harbor seal research program.  This firm is familiar with the research program, the location and the climate condition.  Under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), the value of the contract is expected to be under $100,000 for the base year and four option years (under $100,000 per year). Background on the Harbor Seal Research Program:  Glacier Bay has historically supported one of the largest breeding populations of harbor seals in Alaska.  Harbor seals are an important apex predator and the most numerous marine mammal in the park; however, harbor seals have declined by up to 75% in Glacier Bay since 1992 when monitoring efforts began.  In 2004, the National Park Service initiated research aimed at addressing hypotheses associated with the decline of harbor seals in Glacier Bay National Park.  The research requires the capture of harbor seals to assess survival, body condition, health and disease status, and movements.   This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals or quotations.  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals or quotations received in response to this notice.  This service will be procured under Firm Fixed Price Service in accordance with FAR 37 procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1. The anticipated award date is March 12, 2007. Point of contact for this acquisition is Ms. Marichu Relativo at 907-644-3311 or email: marichu_relativo@nps.gov. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, and should furnish detailed data (10 pages or less) concerning their capabilities to provide the services sought including pricing data and technical data sufficient enough to determine that a comparable source to the government is available.  The Government will be the sole determiner regarding an offeror's ability to meet all requirements.  The government will consider all EOIs received prior to 3 days after date of publication of this synopsis before 4:00 pm Pacific Standard Time on that date. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  EOIs sent via the U.S. Postal Service should be mailed to National Parks Service, Alaska Regional Office, Attn: Marichu Relativo (AKRO-APM), 240 W. 5th Ave, Room 114, Anchorage, Alaska 99501. EOIs sent via Federal Express or hand carried must be delivered to the same address above during weekdays, excluding federal holidays, between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.  EOIs may be submitted via fax to Attn:  Ms. Marichu Relativo, Contract Specialist, at 907-644-3802.  The facsimile transmission must clearly identify this notice and the name of the contracting officer on the first page.  Submitters bear the burden of ensuring that the EOI reaches the designated contracting officer on time and should allow a reasonable time for facsimile transmissions to be completed.  All pages of the transmission must reach the office before the deadline specified and pages of a facsimile transmission that arrive in the office after the specified deadline will not be considered.  The submitter bears the risk of non-receipt of facsimile transmissions and should confirm by telephone that any facsimile was received.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest is extending the current 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) from 25 April 2007 to 24 April 2008 and is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, California and Phoenix, Arizona) to participate in this BOA program.  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to two additional years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement.  Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.  Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed.  If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts.  The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).  Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA.  Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable).  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000 per firm over the life of the agreement.  Individual task orders will range between $2,000 and $500,000.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.  Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year.  Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly.  No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate.  Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued.  The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder.  Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.  This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party.  Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation.  Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA.  Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA.  Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible.  To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) Developmental Stage participant (Joint Venture/Mentor Prot?g? firms are not allowed) prior to the submission date of 08 March 2007; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, CA or Phoenix, AZ); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/; and VETS-100 at http://vets.dol.gov/vets100/ (if not applicable, provide statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,000 - $500,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years.  TO BE CONSIDERED, INTERESTED FIRMS MUST DOWNLOAD AND USE THE CHECKLIST FROM THIS WEBSITE TO ENSURE ALL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED.  Please submit your package to NAVFAC Southwest, Attn: Erica Sist, Code RAQ20.ES, 1220 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92132, or via e-mail to erica.sist@navy.mil not later than 2:00 PM Pacific Time on 08 March 2007.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is interested in working with an entity to provide student internships for students to work at the Kennedy Space Center in support of the Center’s mission through the award of a cooperative agreement.  Students must have a 3.00 overall GPA, be a US citizen, and be enrolled as a full time student in an accredited educational institution.  Students must be at least 16 years of age at the time of entering the first work period and pass a background investigation.  The total number of participants is estimated to be 35 during the first year and could expand to approximately 45 students participating in later years.  NASA anticipates continuing support for this program for one full program cycle, contingent on the availability of funds, progress, and continued relevance to the NASA mission.   The purpose of the Kennedy Space Center’s (KSC) Intern Program (KIP) is to provide work experiences that relate to the degree being pursued.  In addition, this will provide opportunities that train, educate and motivate students to pursue college/university degree programs leading to NASA-related careers in business, science and engineering related disciplines.  Depending on the needs of KSC, students may be provided an opportunity to intern more than one term.  In addition, some students may be high school seniors from the local area. The goals of the program are to: •	Encourage students to stay in school by increasing awareness and interest in business and engineering career fields; •	Help students develop skills and exposure necessary for successful careers in NASA/KSC related professions; •	Provide college students with financial aid to promote their retention in school and to encourage their completion of a college education; •	Provide additional administrative and technical support to NASA/KSC; •	Create a mechanism to help students pipeline into other KSC student programs, and eventually gain entry into the NASA workforce;  •	Build partnerships with the community, government, industry and educational institutions to enhance program efforts and maximize the diversity and quality of students that participate and benefit from this internship experience.

The Association of Manila Bay Developers (AMBD), a consortium of private developers in the Bay City area in greater Manila, Philippines, invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the development of a desalination plant facility in the Philippines.

Manila's Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) is responsible for providing water to the Bay City area and had appointed Mayniland Water Services, Inc. (MWSI) as the concessionaire for the water services.  MWSI has filed for bankruptcy leaving MWSS to identify a new concessionaire and determine how to provide adequate water to a present population of 10,000 that will continue to grow over the next 10-15 years.  To meet these needs the AMBD is prepared to consider financing for a desalination plant to service the Bay City and their tenants.  The AMBD has requested USTDA funding to determine the technical requirements of the plant and the best means to organize and operate the facility.  The feasibility study will assess the technical, economic, financial, environmental and regulatory feasibilities and the developmental impacts associated with seawater and/or brackish water desalination and conditioning for potable water use in the study area.  In addition, the objective of the study is to provide the details of a competitive procurement process for the selection of a Design-Build-Operate (DBO) Contractor.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $416,567 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  In addition to the USTDA funding, the AMBD has agreed to provide funding in accordance with the Terms of Reference set forth in Annex I of the Grant Agreement.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM LOCAL TIME, MONDAY MARCH 12, 2007 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Any questions regarding this solicitation should be address to: Bonnie Lackey at bonilie.l.lackey@usace.army.mil. 	The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a competitive requirement for Rock Pillar Stabilization at Howard Hanson Dam.   Howard Hanson Dam (HHD) is located on the Green River in western Washington and is a 230-foot-high rock fill dam.  The existing out let tunnel is 900 ft long, with a 19 ft semi-horseshoe shaped cross section, which is concrete lined.  A Fish Passage Facility is being constructed adjacent to the existing outlet tower and outlet tunnel.  To date, the excavation has progressed from elevat ion 1150 to 1074 feet and the front section of the Fish Passage Facility has been constructed and is being used as cofferdam to keep the excavation separated from the reservoir. 	This work includes drilling and grouting for foundation strengthening for the rock pillar that will be formed between the excavation and the outlet tunnel when excavation work progresses below elevation 1074 feet.   Grouting work that requires plugging of  drain holes in the existing outlet tunnel and an observer within the tunnel during all grouting activities will be performed during a 60 day work period, approximately 15 July 2007 to 15 September 2007, when the tunnel is typically not used to pass river flows.  All foundation grouting work must be completed during this 60 day window so the tunnel can be used for reservoir management and flood control after this date.  	Construct 22, 16-inch inclined drilled shafts approximately 70 feet long with structural steel W8X67 wide flange beams, centralizers, and other necessary appurtenances, and filled with concrete.  The drilled shafts are to be located within the rock pillar  that will be formed between the excavation and the outlet tunnel when excavation work progresses below elevation 1074 feet 	Also includes the decommissioning of 3 existing 12-inch diameter dewatering wells 250  350 feet deep at the Howard Hanson Dam Fish Passage Facility located near Palmer, Washington. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 with a size standard of $31 Million.  Project is open to both large and small business.  The magnitude of this construction project is estimated between $500,000 and $1 Million.  If y ou are a large business and your proposal will exceed $1 million, you will be required to submit a subcontracting plan with goals for small, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, small woman-owned, and small veteran-owned concerns.  For the purposes of this procur ement, a concern is considered a small business if its annual average gross revenue, taken for the last 3 fiscal years, does not exceed $13 million.  For additional contracting opportunities, visit the Army Single Face to Industry at http://acquisition.arm y.mil/. This solicitation will be issued as an Electronic Bid Set (EBS) on the Seattle District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Web page in electronic format only.  No disks will be mailed.

<CONTACT>Annette  Harkless, (405)  954-8925
<DESC>This procurement is totally set aside for small business concerns.  The contractor shall furnish all personnel, materials, equipment and the services necessary to perform the requirements in the attached solicitation.  The period of performance on this requirement is 12-months. The FAA's Aviation Safety (AVS) organization that is responsible for promoting aviation safety by regulating and overseeing the civil aviation industry will issue a contract for its Aircraft Certification Service (AIR) organization located in Fort Worth, TX.   The AIR organization is responsible for developing, administering and ensuring compliance to standards governing the design, production, airworthiness, and continued operational safety of civil aircraft and related components.  Among AIR's most valuable assets are the knowledge, skills, and abilities of its workforce.  This is especially true in the issuance of engineering and manufacturing approvals for aircraft design, related components, and production systems.  Data generated during original certifications is used as a basis for design and production modifications, some of which may occur twenty or more years after the original approval.  Currently AIR personnel are dependent on labor-intensive work processes and an archaic paper-based information system.  These processes, combined with limited resources, could lead to decreased operational productivity and mission effectiveness and negatively impact management oversight of the AIR designees' workforce.  In order to provide continued operational safety, AIR needs an integrated source of safety and compliance information and processes organized for easy, quick access, anytime, anyplace.  Automated tools are needed for capturing knowledge and work metrics as part of normal work activities.  Contemporary practices are required for increasing collaboration such as the use of electronic meetings to share project information.  Automated tools are required for analyzing data to predict potentially unsafe conditions and for providing easily accessible management information.  The Aviation Safety Knowledge Management Environment (ASKME) will meet these identified needs by storing AIR knowledge assets making them accessible, facilitating management and workforce decision making, providing a proactive system safety approach, and improving productivity in accomplishing the AIR mission.   All responses to this solicitation shall be mailed to the following address Federal Aviation Administration, Attn:  Annette Harkless, Contracting Officer, AMQ-320, P.O. Box 25082, 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, OK  73169, or submitted electronically to annette.harkless@faa.gov in either Microsoft Word, or portable document format (pdf).  Please note that the FAA e-mail server restricts file size to 10MB per e-mail, therefore responses may have to be submitted in more than one e-mail in order to be received.  Responses are due no later than 4:00 PM CT on January 29, 2007.  NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIRES will be accepted.   All Inquiries shall be in writing and submitted electronically to the following email address: annette.harkless@faa.gov (Reference market survey DTFAAC-07-R-00006), or faxed to 405-954-0042.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Full and Open, unrestricted competition to acquire the Embedded Platform Logistics System (EPLS).  The RFP will include engineering and production, installation, testing and test support, training, software support, sustaining engineering, contractor logistics support, post deployment software support, and technical data.     The EPLS will provide the capability to measure and monitor platform health and function, leading to enhanced logistics support, war fighting readiness decision support, and situational awareness. The EPLS will collect, process, display, store, and transmit information on platform operational status. Information will be collected on items such as platform power train and chassis, fuel supply, ammunition supply, weapon system condition, and mobile loads.     The EPLS will also contain the platform maintenance history and technical reference specification!  s.     The EPLS will be installed on the following platforms: the Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR), the Light Armored Vehicle (LAV), and the Amphibian Assault Vehicle (AAV).     EPLS will use a combination of onboard sensors, processors, user interfaces and transmitters to monitor continuously and collect, process, store, transmit, and display platform logistics status. This data will be processed at the platform and displayed to vehicle operators. Maintainers, using either a wireless reader or hardwire interface to a portable maintenance aid, will be able to download and read this same data upon indication that the vehicle is operating outside its prescribed performance parameters or there is an indication of an impending or actual fault. This will enable real-time exchange with the Command and Control (C2) and Logistics Enterprises, namely Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and Global Combat Service Support System Marine Corps (GCSS-MC).   The proposed con!  tract will be a 5 year, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) , Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) contract with some Time and Material line items.     Minimum and maximum quantities for the MTVR, LAV, and AAV will be respectively 14/7,500; 14/1,000; and 14/1,500.  The North American Industry Clasification System (NAICS) code is 334513.  The anticipated response time will be 30 days, once issued.  This solicitation will be subject to the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a – 10d) and the Berry Act (10 U.S.C. 2533a) with flow-down requirement to subcontractors at all tiers for specialty metals. Questions concerning this acquisition should be addressed to Mr. Quentin W.

<DESC>Question;
	The RFI mentions 1,500 inputs total but it also states that the system is for both DC and Fort Worth. Our history with BEP is that they typically have kept the two systems separate. 	Are we to assume that this RFI is a general RFI for 1,500 inputs at each site, each running independently from each other? Or, is BEP planning on having 1,500 inputs combined 	between the two sites and shared, centralized storage for all cameras from both sites?
	
	Answer;

	The RFI is for a 1,500 input DVR system and storage for DC and a separate 1,500 input DVR system and storage  for Fort Worth.  At present there are no plans to connect 
	the sites in any way.

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is seeking industry feedback on current and future advanced display technologies.  The purpose of the RFI is to gather industry-wide feedback on current and upcoming display technologies that can view flicker-free stereoscopic imagery and exhibit smooth and continuous, blur-free roam capabilities.

2. NOTICE. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties? expense.   Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in a future RFP, if one is issued.

3. BACKGROUND. NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate geospatial-intelligence in support of national security objectives. Geospatial-intelligence is the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the Earth. The NGA mission requires the display of softcopy geospatial data in both monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing modes with high resolution and image quality.  NGA currently utilizes high-resolution Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) monitors to provide continuous blur-free motion roam functionality and view stereoscopic image pairs. Monochrome CRT displays have historically been used for panchromatic imagery exploitation owing to their excellent sharpness and high dynamic range, enabling the observer to distinguish details in the imagery.  Color CRT displays have historically been used for color imagery exploitation and presentation of color text and graphics. Geospatial-intelligence analysts use specialized COTS image viewer applications such as RemoteView, SOCET SET/GXP, ERDAS Imagine, ENVI, and Image Scout while exploiting and analyzing imagery in stereo and in roaming the image.  CRT monitors perform exceptionally well in the area of image roam performance.  CRT roam is a smooth and continuous panning motion directed by the geospatial-intelligence analyst through large-area images.  Blur-free image motion enables the analyst to detect faint target objects of interest while searching through the image.  The addition of an active polarizing filter and passive polarized glasses allows analysts to resolve two images from a stereo pair into a true stereoscopic image.


4. INFORMATION REQUEST. NGA is requesting information on desktop display technologies that can exhibit capabilities of smooth continuous, blur-free motion roam and/or flicker-free stereoscopic image pairs.  NGA is interested in what technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are currently available, what technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are being planned, and the timeframe when technologies that meet or exceed these capabilities are planned to be available. Interested parties are requested to submit the following information for each display technology on the provided Display Technology Submission Form, attached to a cover letter with points of contact (POCs).

Single or Multiple screen display
In/Near Production or Prototype
Display Type (IPS or PVA LCD, Plasma, etc.)
Color or Grayscale (color gamut or whitepoint)
Luminance Response
Calibration (Integrated photo sensors, 10-bit look-up tables, user-defined aim, remote access)
Pixel response time (msec)
Pixel density (pixels per inch)
Pixel format (Minimum of 1920 x 1200)
Refresh rate (Minimum 60 Hz per eye for flicker-free stereo)
Roam rate (Minimum 750 pixels/second)
Display Size (Minimum 20 inches diagonal)
Dimensions (W x H x D)
Power consumption (watts)
Lifetime (Minimum 25,000 hours)
Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF)
Projected price per unit ($)
Projected availability (currently available, 1-3 months, etc.)
Available for Demo (yes/no)
	
NGA recognizes that vendors can provide other pertinent information to distinguish their products, and are encouraged to do so. For example, a minimum of 60Hz refresh rate (per image) is considered necessary for Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) to display flicker-free stereoscopic image pairs, though other means may be used in flat panels to achieve the desired result while having a refresh rate less than 60 Hz.

5. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS. Interested parties are requested to complete the display technology information submission form no later than 26 January 2007 to Tracie.L.Flora@nga.mil or fax it to 703-755-5601.  In addition, review the softcopy exploitation display hardware performance standard guidelines.  Both forms will be posted no later than 24 January 2007 on www.nga.mil under Business Opportunities.  

6. POINT OF CONTACT. Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Robert Crain, Robert.C.Crain@nga.mil, and Arthur Cobb, Arthur.L.Cobb@nga.mil.

7. SUMMARY. This RFI is to obtain useful market information concerning desktop flat panel display technology currently in production, in R&D or in future plans.

<DESC>Sources Sought


This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. Qualified sources are limited to 8(a), Hubzone, and small businesses including service disabled veteran owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses and women owned small businesses. Those parties that have an interest and ability to provide FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) with the services detailed below should SUBMIT CAPABILITY STATEMENTS. The capability statement and supporting data that clearly illustrate/exhibit the contractor's ability to perform the specified requirement, such as previous similar services performed or resumes, must be submitted no later than February 5, 2007. An electronic copy and four hard copies of the capability statement and each supporting document shall be sent to the contact listed in this announcement. This IS NOT a request for proposals. This synopsis seeks to identify the interest from prospective contractors to assist FDA in the ongoing research, development, and implementation of CDRH's Medical Product Safety Network (MedSun).  

Project Description:     

MedSun is a CDRH adverse event reporting/feedback pilot program that has been funded since 2002 under a Task Order contract.  That contract expires in August 2007.  The MedSun program currently includes 350 hospitals and nursing homes which report on-line to CDRH about problems with the use of medical devices.  The program involves investigation of those problems, creating solutions to those issues, and providing feedback to the clinical community about the problems and the solutions.  Educational tools are developed to teach clinicians how to recognize device problems, how to write quality reports about those problems, and how to improve the safe and effective use of devices.  This development is a creative, ongoing process.  The program requires specific, advanced technical capabilities and knowledge.  The technical capabilities include: understanding and experience with sociological research, understanding and experience of surveys and sampling methodologies, experience with a wide array of large health data bases and national health care organizations, techniques for quality assurance, understanding of trend analysis, sound judgment about data quality and usefulness, and development of outcome measures. Technical capabilities also include a wide array of research techniques for special studies to understand the use of medical devices in the clinical community, the ability to present technical materials in written and graphical form to non-technical audiences, and a staff of nurses, physicians, and engineers highly knowledgeable of the use of medical devices in all areas of hospitals. In addition to these technical capabilities, a detailed understanding of federal and state policies related to collection of health care data and medical device adverse events is critical, as well as a detailed understanding of the medical device related statutes of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the associated medical device regulations. 

Because the MedSun program is an ongoing program, there can be no time lag in transitioning the current program from the current contractor to a new contractor.  Therefore, a prospective candidate must have the in-house capability to be able to assume the full project and provide seamless workflow from the beginning of the new Task Order contract.

Describe in detail your proven capability and current in-house capacity to perform all the following required capabilities, as well as those cited in the Project Description paragraph, above:

Experience in recruiting a representative sample of acute-care hospitals for participation in long-term research efforts.

Experience in training hospital staff in use of electronic reporting system to report device-related events and providing technical support to more than 1000 system users.

Experience in maintaining on-going cooperation from health-care provider organizations in a national, large-scale patient safety reporting effort.

Demonstrated ability to maintain high level of data security handling sensitive data collected from health provider organizations; credibility with hospital community regarding collection and handling of organizationally sensitive data.

Capability to provide programming and systems support to FDA in maintaining and performing enhancements on secure on-line patient safety reporting system.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Electronic Data Manager (EDM) Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) Message Router (GMR):  The Product Manager for Air Warrior (PM AW) is interested in reducing the cost and improving the reliability of its EDM System via integration of the functionality of three existing Lowest Replaceable Units (LRUs) with one new Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS)LRU. The EDM GMR will be part of the EDM System and provide the interface between the EDM and the Aircraft mounted GPS antenna and the Blue F orce Tracking (BFT) transceiver and Pallet.  The GPS provides the location information for the moving map located in the EDM. The EDM GMR replaces the following three (3) existing BFT/EDM items:   1. Tactronics 6 Port Ethernet Switch 2. Raytheon Micro-Router 3. Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR) or Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR). Sources are sought with similar existing products and experience integrating similar products for Army Aviation platforms. It is anticipated that the EDM GMR will be the hardware provided to the software developer. Experience with security products and wor king with a third party software developer will prove helpful.  Due to anticipated Security restrictions this sources sought is restricted to firms which meet the following additional requirements:  1.    Contractor must be Free from Foreign Ownership, Control and Influence (FOCI). 2.    Contractor must have a facility clearance of SECRET or higher in accordance with DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). 3.    Contractor is required to have a COMSEC account established by the US Government. This requirement is specified in DoD 5220.22A, Communications (COMSEC) Security Annex.    A draft specification for the EDM GMR is available from the Contracting Officer, and sources with applicable experience, interest and qualifications are invited to comment and make recommendations to this specification. Interested/qualified sources are invited to respond to the contracting officer at anne.baune@redstone.army.mil if they meet the security restrictions mentioned above and are interested in reviewing the EDM GMR specification. There are no solicitation packages available at this time.  Later in this process, Air Warrior will announce the availability of a solicitation, should the government elect to continue through to acquisition.  This announcement does not constitute a pre-so licitation notice nor is it a request for proposal.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABLILITY OF AUTHORITY)

This software is required to enable the MARCENT Command element to have within its ranks a diverse language capability to enable communication in the joint environment with NATO forces and with those forces within the countries which we are responsible for maintaining a presence.  The software uses only the voices of native speakers, authentic texts, and thousands of real-life images, Rosetta Stone develops everyday proficiency in listening comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing.

Currently, the MARCENT G-2 has twenty Rosetta Stone software suits and this purchase will be to replenish our on-hand library and to issue out to current language speakers to maintain their competency and also to a few targeted individuals to attempt to diversify our language capability to include a few languages that are not prevalent but are very necessary within our operating forces.  This program will save money by being able to provide our own language speakers for translation and communication requirements instead of having to contract for linguists to fill some less critical language requirements.  The current twenty language software suites are valued over $5,000.00.

(End of Clause); 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items (Sept 2005): ADD: Requirements for Procurement of Critical Assets:  (a) Every effort must be made to ensure that supplies are provided and integrated and services are performed using sound security components, practices and procedures.  Acquisition of supplies or services from concerns under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) or of supplies developed, manufactured, maintained or modified by concerns under FOCI (any or all of which shall be referred to herein as Use of FOCI source) is of serious concern and must be approved prior to contract award.  (b) Approval decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after the source or technology has been identified by the Offeror and subjected to a risk assessment.  The risk assessment process will vary depending on the acquisition type and proposed use of a FOCI source, available risk mitigation measures and the information/justification provided by the Offeror.  (c) Any Offeror responding to this RFQ acknowledges the Governments requirements to secure services or equipment from firms which are under FOCI or where any FOCI, in the opinion of the Government, adversely impacts on National Security or security requirements.  The Offeror understands and agrees that the Government retains the right to reject any responses to this RFQ made by the Offeror, without any further recourse by or explanation to the Offeror, if the FOCI for that Offeror is determined by the Government to be an unacceptable security risk.  (d) Risk assessments will be made on a case-by-case basis and will be used to determine whether the use of a FOCI source poses an unacceptable security risk.  If an unacceptable security risk is determined, the Government retains the right to reject the use of a FOCI source or to require that certain risk mitigation measures be taken by the Offeror.  Similarly, the Government retains the unilateral right to approve the use of a FOCI source when the risk assessment indicates that such use would be in the Governments best interests.  If the use of a FOCI source is not approved, no classified information will be disclosed to the Offeror as part of the Governments rationale for non-approval. The Offeror (prime and subs) may not seek reimbursement from the Government for any costs associated with responding to this RFQ as a result of FOCI non-approved decisions.  (e) Offerors shall complete the Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests (SF 328) and Key Management Personnel Listing (KMPL) for the prime contractor and all proposed subcontractors.  Offerors shall submit this information with their quote.  Submissions should include identification of the RFQ number, name of the assigned Contracting Officer and certification of the accuracy for the provided information by an Executive Management Official of the company.  Provision of false information shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this contract.  (f) The Government reserves the right to prohibit individuals who are not U.S. citizens from all or certain aspects of the work to be performed under this Contract.  (g) Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI).  For purposes of this clause, a U.S. company is considered under FOCI whenever a foreign interest has the power, direct or indirect, and whether or not exercisable through the ownership of the U.S. company securities, by contractual arrangements or other means, to direct or decide matters affecting the management or operations of that company.  (h) Changed conditions, such as change in ownership, indebtedness, or the foreign intelligence threat, may justify certain adjustments to the security terms under which a company is operating, or, alternatively, that different FOCI mitigation measures be employed.  If changed condition is of sufficient significance, it might also result in a determination that a company is no longer considered to be under FOCI.  There is a continuing obligation of the Selected Offeror to advise the Government of such changed conditions.  Failure to abide by this obligation shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this contract. (i) The following factors will be used as the basis for making a FOCI determination.  If the Offeror, or its proposed subcontractors, meet any of the following factors, they must identify themselves as a potential FOCI company and submit themselves to a Government FOCI evaluation and risk assessment: (1) Ownership or beneficial ownership, direct or indirect, of 5 percent or more of the Offerors companys voting securities by a foreign person; (2) Ownership or beneficial ownership, direct or indirect, of 25 percent or more of any class of the Offerors companys nonvoting securities by a foreign person; (3) Management positions, such as directors, officers or executive personnel of the Offerors company held by non-U.S. citizens; (4) Foreign person power, direct or indirect, to control the election, appointment or tenure of directors, officers, or executive personnel of the Offerors company or other decisions or activities of the Offerors company; (5) Contracts, agreements, understandings or arrangements between the Offerors company and a foreign person; (6) Loan arrangements between the Offerors company and a foreign person if the Offerors companys (the borrower) overall debt to equity ratio is 40:60 or greater; or financial obligations that are subject to the ability of a foreign person to demand repayment; (7) Annual total revenues or net income in excess of 5 percent from a single foreign person or in excess of 30 percent from the foreign persons in the aggregate; (8) Ten percent or more of any class of the Offerors voting securities held in nominee shares, in street names, or some other method that does not disclose the beneficial ownership of equitable title; (9) Interlocking directors with foreign persons and any officer or management official of the Offerors company who is also employed by a foreign person; (10) Any other factor that indicates or demonstrates a capability on the part of foreign persons to control or influence the operations or management of the Offerors company; (11) Ownership of ten percent or more of any foreign interest. (End of Clause) Contracting Officers Security Representative (COSR) are the designated security representatives of the Contracting Officer and derive their authorities directly from the Contracting Officers.  They are responsible for certifying the contractors capability for handling classified material and ensuring that customer security policies and procedures are met.  The COSR is the focal point for the contractor, Contracting Officer, and Contracting Officers Technical Representative regarding security issues.

The announcement constitutes the only  solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not  be issued.  Request for Quotation: W15QKN-07-T-0209.  This software will be a  tool that can input hex meshes made from third party software in a generic mesh  form. In addition to inputting geometry, the software will contain an intrinsic  capability to create 2D or 3D parts and meshes. Both external and internal  geometries will be able to be put together in assemblies that boundary  conditions and loads can be applied to. The material models in the software  code will consist of linear elastic models, linear/non-linear plastic models  that can be strain rate dependent, and failure models for the deletion of  elements. Solver techniques will include, Langragian, SPH, Eulerian, and ALE.  In addition, all four (4) solvers will be able to be used in the same job/run  of an analysis. The tying in-between the langragian solver and the Eulerian/ALE  solver will be a coupling but both meshes must retain their independence on  each other (no joined nodes). The solver techniques will be able to be run on a  parallel processor computer as well as a single processor desktop. The output  will be able to be output to one node as well as the whole model. In this  manner values at specific points can be tracked and plotted with time. Also,  stress, pressures, displacements and velocities values will be able to be  mapped onto the geometry/mesh. Movies files as well as picture files will be  able to be made from the software. The entire capabilities listed above will be  wrapped into one program and GUI in which the user can access from a desktop  computer. Acceptance of this software will be destination.

<CONTACT>Kathleen Henderson, Contract Specialist, Phone 813-281-0560 X304, Fax 813-281-2658, Email henderk@socom.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to RFP H92222-07-R-0055, UHF High Gain SATCOM Antenna is as follows:  1) Delete CLIN 1007 as described/stated in Amendment 5; 2) Add the following revised CLIN 1007 description: CLIN 1007 Technical Data (Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL)), Not Separately Priced (NSP), CDRL A001 ? Commercial Off The Shelf Manuals.  For proposal purposes, the Government will provide CDRL A001 (electronic version)to the Offeror, upon request.  The Contractor shall provide COTS manuals with each antenna (1:1 ratio). All CDRLs are electronic submission; and 3) Post the Questions/Answers for the UHF High Gain SATCOM Antennas (RFP H9222207R0055) solicitation. Questions and Government Responses are as follows: Question 1: CLINs 1007 through 5007 require pricing for CDLS with maximum quantities stated for each year. We understand this to be the Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), as described in section 3.0 of the SOW. The SOW describes this as all qualified labor, supervision, materials, equipment, tools, appliances and services to repair the antennas at the contractor's facility and ship the antannas back to the government. It further requires the contractor to obtain Government authorization prior to beginning any repair on an antenna, and to provide to the Government a written estimate of the repairs, including the cost of materials and labor required for the repair. Depending on the nature of the damage to be repaired, this cost could cover a very wide range, from a minimal action to repairs costing  up to 65% of the value of a new antenna. Therefore, it is difficult to make a estimate of the cost of an average repair for each CLIN. Any clarification or guidance the Government may be able to provide will be appreciated. Response 1: The Government intends to amend the solicitation to delete the Contractor Depot Logistics Support. Question 2: The SOW only establishes the technical requirements and repair of the antennas, not the new procurement requirement.
Do you think that paragraph 1.0 of the SOW should be more specific by mentioning procurement also? Response 2: The intent of the combined synopsis/solicitation is to define the Government's UHF High Gain Antenna procurement requirements (in a streamlined approach) in the solicitation document posted on 19 Dec 06.  This solicitation document provides the procurement requirements for this effort. The SOW included in the solicitation is exclusive to defining the UHF High Gain Antenna specifications/requirements only. Question 3:  It is uncertain as to what data should be supplied under CLIN 1007 of solicitation H9222-07-R-0055. Since the product repair and support sections of the SOW have been deleted, it might include illustrated parts breakdown drawings, to facilitate replacement parts ordering. Could you tell us exactly what will be required? Response 3: CLIN 1007 shall apply to Commercial Off The Shelf Manuals, CDRL A001 (this was CDRL A002, but revised as a result of the deletion of CDLS.  The contractor shall provide COTS manuals with each antenna (1:1 ratio). Question 4: There is a user manual for each of our COTS antennas. It contains operator's instructions and also lists the parts available for field repairs and where they can be obtained. Will this meet the requirements of CLIN 1007? Response 4: Yes, the user manual for each of your COTS antennas (as described) will meet the requirements of CLIN 1007.

<DESC>This modification issued to provide questions and answers to subject solicitation and to extend closing date to 26 January 2007 at 2:30pm PST. Q1. Please provide information regarding number of gallons, or amount of square feet to be treated with end use of those areas.  A1.  Dust control product for consolidated surfaces within 5 miles of a water point  - 21,000 gallons     Dust control product for consolidated surfaces greater than 5 miles from a water point - 15,500 gallons     Dust control product for unconsolidated surfaces within 5 miles of a water point - 3,000 gallons Q2.  What is the unit for bidding (example: $/gallon, $/acre, etc.). This project requires using different application rates of the 2 chemicals requested which will dramatically influence the cost to treat a specific site depending on which product is used and how much is applied.  Therefore, to bid the solicitation on a pe r gallon (and per chemical) price that includes delivery and application seems to make the most sense. A2. Unit of bidding is per gallon.  Price proposed shall be inclusive of product, delivery and application.  Q3.  Are there any statistics on previous use and projected use (gallons used, miles treated, etc.)? If so how can they be obtained? A3. PLease refer to Q1 and A1 above. For those questions not addressed in this amendment a follow on a amendment is forthcoming. Point of contact for this action is Marie Velez at Marie.Velez@irwin.army.mil.

<DESC>Amendment is issued to provide questions and answers received. Closing date remains 26 Jan 07. Q1.  Are there any statistics on previous use and projected use (gallons used, miles treated, etc.)? If so how can they be obtained? A1.  Average over last several years has been about 45 acres (or about 12 miles of trail) treated per year. Q2.  The minimum application rate for the iso-alkane is listed as 1 gallon per 20 sq.ft.  What is the minimum application rate for the Soil-Sement and for what type of application site? A2. 1 gal per 32 sq ft Q3. Why is a cure time of 4 hours required for the iso-alkane since iso-alkanes never cure? A3.  This just refers to the length of time before vehicles can drive on the surface without damaging the surface or getting the product on the vehicle. Q4.  The solicitation states the contractor shall be capable of supplying quantities ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 gallons of product at a time.  Does this mean that each time (each service/treatment) there will not be less than 10,000 gallons of product applied?  If not, what is the minimum so we can better calculate our minimums for mobilization each time. A4. Applications are usually twice per year (during breaks in military training) with each being about half the total (see question 2 above).  Some specially requested applications have been around 10,000, but most of our typical applications are around 40 ,000 to 50,000 at a time.
