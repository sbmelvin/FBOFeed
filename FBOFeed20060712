<ARCHDATE>07122007
<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program assesses current water-quality conditions, changes in water quality over time, and the effects of natural and human factors on water quality for the Nation's streams and ground-water resources. For assessing the potential effects of pesticides on aquatic life in streams, NAWQA uses:  (1) a Pesticide Toxicity Index (PTI), and (2) comparisons of measured concentrations to water-quality benchmarks. The PTI combines pesticide exposure of aquatic biota (measured concentrations of pesticides in stream water) with toxicity estimates (standard endpoints from laboratory bioassays) to produce a single index value for a sample or site.  Water quality benchmarks are derived for individual pesticides based on available data for acute and chronic effects for several major taxonomic groups. The initial development of the PTI and derivation of water-quality benchmarks was limited to less than 100 pesticide compounds routinely measured in NAWQA studies and to toxicity data readily available from existing EPA databases, but NAWQA now requires the addition of other pesticides to the method.  Approximately 400 pesticide compounds (including pesticide degradates and adjuvants) have been identified by the Pesticide National Synthesis (PNS) Project as possible contaminants for addition to the existing methods.   The technical staff of the USGS NAWQA PNS Project is preparing a series of reports that address various aspects of the potential effects of pesticides on aquatic life.  To accomplish these analyses, the above described expanded compilations of aquatic-life toxicity information are needed.  The toxicological expertise and data management skill necessary to expand the compilations are not currently available with USGS staff, and it is most efficient for USGS to solicit the expertise of an outside contractor to identify and compile aquatic-life toxicity information. Detailed specifications and required deliverables will be included in the forthcoming solicitation, which will be released on or about 31 July 2006.   The USGS intends to solicit for this requirement utilizing the simplified acquisition procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.  This acquisition is set-aside exclusively for participation by small business concerns, under NAICS code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services, for which the associated size standard is $6.5 million in average (last three years) annual revenue.  For further information, please contact Jeff Caravelli, Contracting Officer at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov. Numbered Notes 1 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The purpose of procuring these Energy Assessments is to assist the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in identifying and developing energy investment initiatives for three national cemeteries. In order to develop energy investment initiatives, VA needs to; 1) evaluate its current energy consumption and commodity purchasing practices and applicable tariffs; 2) confirm or recommend revision to its status quo energy consumption and cost baseline based upon best practices and applicable tariff rates; and 3) develop investment initiatives for moving VA from it_s verified or adjusted status quo baseline to a state of improved energy consumption and cost effectiveness. The EA, via an in-depth energy audit of VA facilities, will serve as the investment tool used for the identification of energy deficiencies/needs, potential energy conservation and cost saving opportunities. VA is seeking short and long-term commodity acquisition and energy investment strategy plans with clear analysis, recommendations and implementation plans. These plans will recommend energy investment strategies for the accomplishment of the energy deficiencies/needs, potential energy conservation and cost savings opportunities as identified through the EA. This solicitation is two phases of a five phase initiative. Questions regarding this solicitation are due no later than COB July 24, 2006, to Grier Buterbaugh, Contracting Officer by e-mail only. Responses to these questions will be provided by COB, July 28,2006. The proposals are due 4 PM ET, August 14, 2006.

The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act (EEOICPA) of 2000 is administered by the Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC) in OWCP that is part of the Energy Standards Administration (ESA) in DOL.  The DEEOIC mission is to deliver benefits to eligible employees and former employees of the Department of Energy (DOE), its contractors and subcontractors, and also to certain survivors of such individuals, as stipulated in the EEOICPA.  The mission also includes delivering benefits to certain beneficiaries of Section 5 of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA).
The current energy case management system provides authorized program staff with case creation, case action, tracking, querying, payment and report generating capabilities. This system maintains records of claims filed, draft benefit determinations, the adjudicatory status of claims paid and denied, the amount of lump sum payments issued, and the eligibility status for covered medical conditions. Authorized staff can create, verify, certify, authorize, and transmit lump sum compensation payment transactions in the payment module of the EEOICP case management system to establish eligibility and pay benefits.  The system’s query function provides authorized DEEOIC staff with ready access to claimant information. The report function in the EEOICP case management system generates case workload management and internal and external reports.  These reports include a set of standardized reports and ad hoc reports that are created to meet specific executive management needs. The system also creates payment eligibility files, which are transmitted using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) technology to facilitate medical bill processing services for OWCP.

The following requirements to the above quantities are as follows: The variety of weapon sights and irradiating devices to be evaluated span a rather wide rage of wavelengths in the electromagnetic !  spectrum (visible band – IS, near infra-red band – NIR, and the short wave infra-red band –SWIR) and therefore require test equipment that can encompass that wavelength range.  In addition, the evaluation of these devices require characterization of lighting equipment in a controlled test facility (which provides known light levels that span overcast starlight conditions and up through full clear daylight conditions), but also the characterization of light in the field which cannot be controlled, day or night.  The lighting conditions in the scene as well as the resultant light of the image as viewed must be able to be characterized by the measuring equipment.  The equipment that is produced by Photo Research, Inc. and cited in this requisition enables the characterization of light in these bands of radiation, and under the wide range of amplitudes that span high daylight to nighttime overcast conditions.  Portability of the equipment is essential since the characterization!   of the radiation is not only needed in the test facility, but also ou tdoors at remote test sites  Some of the unique measurement requirements necessitate a capability to perform automated measurements.  Additionally the equipment must be able to be calibrated with traceability to the National Institute for Standards and Technology.  Associated software, if any, must not interact with the NMCI network.  The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using simplified acquisition procedures and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR parts 12 and 13. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals, as the Government has determined that there is no other vendor that meets the requirements set forth above. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion o!  f the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Questions concerning this intent can be e-mailed to: crystal.m.clark@usmc.mil or faxed to number (703) 432-3526. The date and time of closing is MONDAY, JULY 17, 2006, 3:30pm EST (Eastern Standard Time).

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Primagraphics Limited, 1000 Research Park Boulevard, Suite 106, Charlottesville, VA 22911 for the acquisition of two (2) Radar Client PCI Card, two (2) 3-way Cables, three (3) PUMA PCI Consoles, and two (2) RVP Distribution Server in VME enclosure.  This equipment will be used on the Navigation, Command and Control System (AN/SSN-2(V)5).  It is a very new system that has just been installed at the Ingleside schoolhouse and USS Devastator this month.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Primagraphics Limited is the sole manufacturer for these items.  Currently, drawings or specifications are not available.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 system has already gone through and passed environmental and shock testing with this part installed.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without further testing and approval from the Program Office.  NSWC PC !  has been assigned as the In-Service Engineering Activity and tasked to procure interim support parts; so, time is an issue.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly in time and dollars to the government and to the mission.  Use of another system may change or introduce new parameters that may be harmful to the AN/SSN-2(V)5 system.  Therefore it is imperative that these items are acquired from Primagrahics Limited.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to BioFortis, Inc., 2400 Boston Street, Emerging Technology Center, Factory Building 3RD Floor, Baltimore, MD 21224.  This purchase is for the performance of enhancements to the functionality of the Labmatrix Clinical Database System in support of the new Multiplex Project Initiative. The purpose of this initiative is to create an infrastructure supporting trans-disciplinary research on genetic disease susceptibility. This enhancement will involve data bulk upload design and implementation; data bulk upload testing and quality assurance; multiplex project data transfer; multiplex project testing and quality assurance; multiplex project report generation; and multiplex project database training.  The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the research conducted by the Intramural Research Laboratory of NHGRI uses the Labmatrix Clinical Database System which was designed and developed by BioFortis, specifically to perform both clinical and laboratory based studies. No other organization has a database system designed to adapt to the various needs of many studies being conducted simultaneously. This particular system allows for the collection, organization, maintenance, and integration of both clinical data and laboratory data.  Changing any variables at this time would result in incorrect interpretation of Biomaterials, Genotypes, or other Custom Data.  It is important to return accurate results to physicians or other health professionals and to maintain the ability to import data from various clinical centers.  An award to any other source would affect the Institutes anticipated outcome and would not provide any cost savings to the Government. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541710 and the Size Standard is 500 employees.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-HG-2006-246/KLW may be submitted to the National Heart Lung, and Blood Institute, Consolidated Acquisitions Center, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Kesha Williams.

<SUBJECT>B -- ECONOMIC ANALYSIS FOR ASSESSING DISEASE CONTROL PRIOTITIES

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Center (FIC)intends to procure services to write four scientific papers on assessing economic priorities, and the disease control priorities project from Dean Jamison, Washington, DC.  The FIC/NIH has hosted the secretariat for and managed the implementation of the Disease Control Priorities Project (DCPP).  The first phase of that intensive effort drew to an end with publication – by Oxford University Press in April 2006 – of two major volumes, Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd edition, and The Global Burden of Disease and Risk Factors. A follow-on phase of the work is now beginning.  This phase has two objectives:  (i) widespread dissemination of the two publications, and (ii) completion, extension and documentation of analytic work that has been initiated during the main phase of the project.  The work to be undertaken under this contract contributes to the second of these objectives.  FIC intends to contract with Dr. Dean Jamison to perform the required tasks under this solicitation.  Economic analysis contributes to assessing disease control priorities by informing cost-effectiveness analyses, by contributing to understanding of the factors that affect health, and by attempting to quantify the value of changes in health status.  The 4 papers would appear in the DCPP Working Paper series and be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.  In addition, paper number 4 would be presented at an academic conference in Dijon, France.  To the best of the Government’s knowledge Dr. Jamison has been the Senior Editor for the project since its inception and has led the initial phases of the work on each of the 4 papers under the auspices of his prior intergovernmental personnel agreement.  The academic and scientific areas covered are areas in which Dr. Jamison has published and for which his training in economics (Ph.D., Harvard) prepares him.  He is uniquely qualified to undertake the work on these papers.  Requiring a search for alternative sources would be unproductive, since Dr. Jamison is the only vendor capable of performing the required work.  Interested vendors may identify in writing their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received, before the closing date of this announcement, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   It is anticipated that the Request for Quotation (RFQ) NIH-NIDDK-06-918 will be available fifteen (15) days after the release of the RFQ.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  The anticipated award date is August 7, 2006.  Request for copies of the RFQ must be in writing to the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 6707 Democracy Blvd., Room 774B, Bethesda, MD 20817 Attention:  V. Lynn Griffin.  FAX quotations must contain offerors name, address, telephone number and fax number.  FAX quotations will be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Scientific And Technical Information Center (STIC) intends to procure translation services (all languages) involving the translation of patent and non-patent documents from any foreign language into Standard American English with an estimated value of $8 to 10 million over five (5) years. This is a re-competition of the current translation services contracts held by Foreign Language Service (FLS) (Contract No. 50-PAPT-2-01001), Ralph McElroy & Assoc. (Contract No. 50-PAPT-2-01002), and Schreiber Translations (Contract No. 50-PAPT-2-01003) which expire October 31, 2006. The USPTO intends to make award by October 20, 2006. This procurement is open to qualified small businesses only and multiple awards are anticipated. The contract period is for approximately a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods. The first contract period is expected to commence on November 1, 2006. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541930. The translation services requirement will be to provide accurate, high-quality translations of 1) patent literature (patents, utility models, published patent applications, abstracts, etc.) and 2) non-patent literature (scientific and technical articles, legal documents, reports, letters, etc.). The material to be translated is primarily scientific and technical, can relate to any field, and is frequently difficult linguistically and in content. A partial translation of any given document may also be requested. The language mix and the flow rates fluctuate in the workload of the Translations Branch. Overall, the major portion of the work to be translated is Japanese and German. The target language of the majority of the translations will be English. Translation into foreign languages may be required from time to time. The USPTO reserves the right to issue task orders that may vary somewhat from the usual ordering procedures.
This acquisition will be conducted using the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) located at: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/acquproc.htm. Under PTAG, FAR Part 15 does not apply and “full and open competition” is replaced with “maximum reasonable competition” which authorizes the USPTO to conduct this acquisition using an “alternative streamlined contracting approach.” Pursuant to this approach, this synopsis shall serve as a high-level solicitation. Following receipt of responses to this synopsis/high-level solicitation, the USPTO will evaluate the initial responses and establish a competitive range limited to a predetermined number of not more than five offerors. Upon establishment of the competitive range, those top highest ranked offerors will be notified and instructed on the next phase of the procurement process that will be the release of a detailed Request for Proposal (RFP) to solicit additional information and obtain a more complete offer. As a result of the responses to this Synopsis/High-level Solicitation, those vendors who are determined not to be the most qualified will be advised and will not receive further consideration. The USPTO will evaluate vendors’ responses based on translator qualifications, quality control systems, past performance, and pricing criteria. The offerors will be ranked in terms of qualifications and highest probability to successfully fulfill the USPTO’s requirements. Ultimate source selections will be based upon a best value determination. The process will include submission of an initial capability statement to the USPTO, an evaluation and a down-select of vendors by the USPTO. The USPTO is soliciting Capability Statements from responsible sources that clearly establish their ability to meet or exceed the USPTO’s Translation Services Capabilities Requirement (CR). Interested offerors shall submit a capability statement describing their capability to satisfy the size, scope and characteristics of the requirements (maximum of 10 pages).  The response must address four specific areas: 

(1)	Translator Source and Qualifications (1 typewritten page maximum):
·	A description of the education and experience requirements of proposed translators; and
·	Source of translators (i.e. university, private industry, company employee, consultant or subcontractor). 

(2)	Quality Control Systems (2 typewritten pages maximum):
·	A description of the process you will use to ensure the accuracy of the translations. 

(3)	Past Performance and Experience (3 typewritten pages maximum):
·	Provide a description of previous or current commercial or federal contracts that demonstrate an ability to meet the USPTO’s requirements and describe their relevance to the USPTO’s effort in terms of similarity of nature of work performed, size and scope. Include the contract period of performance dates, method used to determine word count, dollar value, point of contact and phone number.

(4)	Pricing:
·	Provide the price for translation of 1000 words by CLIN for German and Japanese per Attachment 1. Pricing should be provided for each of the three (3) word count methods for the base year;
·	Comment in 2 typewritten pages or less on the completeness and validity of the line items and units of measure shown in the pricing schedule per Attachment 2; and
·	Identify in 2 typewritten pages or less any suggested changes to the statement of work, clauses, contract duration that may improve the quality and pricing under the proposed contract. 

Since all procurement-related documents will be released via the Internet, a mailing list and/or list of interested vendors will not be available. The USPTO anticipates awarding one or more contract(s) as a result of this competition. It is anticipated that the contract type will be a firm fixed price requirements contract. All relevant documents for this procurement will be posted on the USPTO website at the Internet address: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm. It is the responsibility of each prospective offeror to check the project web site regularly for amendments, questions and answers, and other pertinent information concerning the procurement. An offeror’s failure to check the website will not be a justifiable excuse for requesting an extension to the response due date. 

Questions should be forwarded via e-mail to Ann F. Miller @ ann.miller1@uspto.gov, and must be received by 2:00 p.m. (EDST) on Tuesday, July 25, 2006.  Questions received after this date will not be entertained.  Responses to questions will be posted on the USPTO website. 
Responses to this request should be forwarded via e-mail to Ann F. Miller @ ann.miller1@uspto.gov, and must be received no later than 2:00 p.m. (EDST) on Wednesday, August 2, 2006.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS OF THE RC-60 ROBOTIC PLATFORM SYSTEM

The Air Armament Center, 688th Armament Systems Squadron (688 ARSS/PK), Eglin  AFB, FL, intends to award a sole source, commercial, Firm Fixed Price contract to Applied Research Associates (ARA), 4300 San Mateo Blvd NE, Suite B300, Albuquerque, NM 87110-1229, for the delivery of 1 each RC-60 Robotic Platform System.  This contract action will support the Airborne Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)mission project to test this platform for consideration as a replacement for the Air Force (AF)EOD Airborne All-Purpose Remote Transport System (ARTS).  The platform is required to support the target of Full Operational Capability (FOC) by March 2008.  Although the existing Airborne ARTS configuration has adequately supported the Airborne EOD Initial Operational Capability (IOC), it is proving to be too heavy and cumbersome to support the Airborne EOD mission, and needs to be replaced with a lighter-weight, durable and suitable robotics platform.  Along with the ASV RC-60 Posi-Track surface loader, this system includes the following: the NG-500 Universal Operator Control system (UOCS), the Modular Robotic Control System (MRCS), Digital Video Radios, a Rear Mounted IR camera, Loader Arms, a Pallet Fork, a 4 in 1 bucket, a Zoom camera with pan/tilt, a Weight kit, Lift/Tiedown points, a Vehicle Attitude indicator, a Vehicle CG identification, a Robotic Arm with Gripper, and a Spare Parts kit.

The RC-60 robotics platform system will be tested using real-world scenarios to determine whether it can perform the required ARTS tasks.  Performance parameters include, but are not limited to, air/ground transportability, ability to deploy a suite of designated specialized EOD tools, wireless remote control and system mobility.  Airborne sling-load and airdrop testing will be performed in coordination with the US Army’s Airborne Operational Test Directorate, Ft Bragg, NC.  Since the size and weight are reduced by approximately 50% over the ARTS and provide enhanced robotic handling/control characteristics, this robotics platform is an excellent replacement candidate.

The ARA/Vertek Division designed and manufactured the robotics platform system for the commercially available RC-60 from ASV, Inc.  Due to its proprietary ownership of the MRCS, as well as ARTS, ARA is uniquely capable of meeting this Government requirement.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  This notice serves as the notice of proposed contract action.

The delivery requirement is approximately 6 mos. after receipt of order (ARO).  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  All interested parties must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide this capability within thirty calendar days of this publication.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.

For contracting questions, please contact E. Chris Asbill, Contracting Officer, at (850) 883-3519, email: ellen.asbill@eglin.af.mil or Deborah A. Lee, Contract Specialist, at (850) 883-3525, email: deborah.lee@eglin.af.mil.  For technical issues, please contact the Program Manager, 1Lt Carmen Sowers at (850) 883-3557, email: carmen.sowers@eglin.af.mil.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is Colonel Joseph A. Lanni, AAC/CV, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495; his phone number is (850) 882-0662.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to Continuum 3150 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051.  Continuum is the manufacturer of the Surelite III®  laser.  Continuum sells this instrument on a direct basis in the United States, and is therefore the sole source for this system.

The unique features to the Surelite III®  laser are as follows:

This Continuum laser is a widely tunable (420 nm – 2.63 um) all-solid-state optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser system that will provide a qualitatively new for FDA.

The unique features of this laser system (continuously tunable laser emission in a broad spectral range covering the visible, near-infrared and partially mid-infrared spectral ranges as well as high beam quality, stability and reproducibility) will allow us to significantly improve our measurement and testing capabilities in support of the radiation control act and for regulatory decisions concerning new laser based biomedical devices.  Using this equipment FDA will be able to conduct independent tests and to evaluate fundamental parameters and characteristics of new biomedical laser devices.  This equipment is of critical importance for development of standard test methods and guidance documents.  In addition, the widely tunable laser system will be used for some of the FDA current and pending research and regulatory projects such as high-resolution bio-imaging; multiphoton nonlinear tissue spectroscopy, studying hazard effects at high intensity laser-tissue interactions and laser stimulated neural tissue.  This system is compatible with the existing equipment and the only widely tunable laser system that meets the requirement of the current and pending regulatory/research projects.

All items are considered commercial or modified commercial.  This is a representative list and should not be considered exhaustive of all products that will be required of the acquisition.  The intended solicitation will provide worldwide coverage with the following regions; the Southeast with an estimated yearly value of $7.3M will consist of the following: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Panama, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The Northeast with an estimated yearly value of $6.6M includes Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Europe.  The Great Lakes/Capital with an estimated yearly value of $22.9M includes the District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  The Mid West with an estimated yearly value of $20.5M includes Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas. The West with an estimated yearly value of $22M includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming and Guam, U.S. Possessions (Northern Marianas, & American Samoa), Japan and Korea.  The intended solicitation will contain a listing of the ordering activities located within this region.  Prospective offerors should have the capability to deliver fire and emergency service items, equipment and related products as well as incidental services and training within the region.  The required delivery for most items is 7 to 15 days.  The intended solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resulting contracts being an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for two (2) base years and three (3) one-year options and will include provisions for economic price adjustments and a guaranteed minimum.  Offers will be requested on an FOB destination basis.  It is proposed to issue multiple awards within each region in accordance with FAR 16.504. The government intends to make up to 5 awards in the Great Lakes/Capital, Midwest and West regions and up to 4 awards in the Northeast and Southeast Regions.  A minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 awards per region are anticipated in the Northeast and Southeast.  A minimum of 4 and a maximum of 5 awards per region are anticipated for the Great Lakes/Capital, Midwest and West regions.  The government intends on making the minimum (3 or 4) awards per region, reserving one (1) additional award per region for small business, provided that: a) no small business is awarded one of the three/four initial awards for that region and b) there is a small business offer tendered that meets all the requirements of the solicitation and is in the competitive range with the other awardees for that region.  The estimated value of this acquisition is $156,600,000.00 for the base period; $397,000,000.00 for total contract period.  This will be a best value/source selection acquisition in which technical merit is more important than price.

<CONTACT>Denise Boren, Contracting Officer (90C) Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center 2121 North Avenue Grand Junction, CO 81501
<DESC>Furnish all design, construction period services and provide an estimate for the construction contract detailed below.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for Small Emerging Business in accordance with the Small Business Demonstration Program (FAR 19.10).  NAICS is 541330 with a size standard of $4.5 million in average annual receipts for the last three fiscal years.  Procurement is also restricted to firms licensed in the state of Colorado.  Firms desiring consideration should submit their SF330 no later than August 14, 2006. 1.  CRITERIA:  The VA Medical Center in Grand junction Colorado is interested in reconfiguring a portion of the pharmacy area on the first floor east wing to incorporate a pharmaceutical compounding , sterile preparation room that is in compliance with USP Chapter 797.  The architect/engineer shall study the existing conditions of the building envelope and mechanical systems and recommend viable solutions that meet the needs of the pharmacy service and the requirements of the USP 797 criteria.  USP <797> is considered to be an official minimum standard for pharmacy sterile compounding and it is therefore enforceable by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state boards of pharmacy and other regulatory agencies.  As such USP <797> is an enforceable requirement that mandates procedures and processes for sterile drug compounding (mixing) of pharmaceuticals in a clean room environment. USP <797> specifies International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for acceptable clean room airborne particulate concentrations and assessment procedures. NIOSH has jurisdiction over the standards for drugs requiring separate preparation areas for personnel safety. 2.  DEFINITIONS:   1.  According to ISO, a clean room is defined as "a room in which the concentration of airborne particles is controlled, and which is constructed and used in a manner to minimize the introduction, generation, and retention of particles inside the room, and in which other relevant parameters, e.g., temperature, humidity, and pressure, are controlled as necessary."  Refer to USP<797> pharmaceutical compounding - sterile preparations, pharmacy design briefing document for this definition. 2.  Refer to USP 797 pharmacy design briefing document.  a copy is available from the facility engineering office for helpful information listed under pharmacy safety for ISO class 5, class 7 and class 8 clean rooms. 3. Air lock: A small room or space ("pass-through" chamber or window) between two rooms of different air pressure, with interlocked doors (one tightly closed at all times) to prevent loss of pressure in the higher pressure room. 3.  DISCUSSION:  USP 797 issued in January 2004 describes three risk levels defined by the complexity of the compounding process, namely Low, Medium and High risk level compounding, all of which require that work involving the sterile compounding shall take place under International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Class 5 conditions within a buffer area that should be ISO Class 7 with appropriate air conditioning and humidity controls in place in the buffer area environment.  These standards are to be exemplified in every category.  Class 5 environments require hundreds of air changes of HEPA filtered air, stringent gowning and masking requirements, Anteroom etc. The Class 5 environment is achievable in four ways: Option 1: Provide a Class 5 Clean room. Option 2: Provide a Class 5 critical area (laminar flow hood area) within a Class 7 Clean buffer room (deals with much lower standard of air particulates), in which all sterile compounding work takes place within a laminar airflow work station (LAFW).  The LAFW is a biological safety cabinet with HEPA air supplied over the working surface.  The anteroom or support area, which is outside the buffer area, should be ISO Class 8. Option 3: Perform all sterile compounding within Primary Air Flow Barriers (PAFBs). PAFBs are glove-box enclosures similar to totally enclosed biological safety cabinets. Option 4: Consider use of a portable clean room.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Carol Pomraning, Contract Specialist, Ph:(410) 642-1043, Fx:(410) 642-1102
<DESC>Solicitation no. IFB 512(P)-83-06 for the LOCH RAVEN EXPANSION PROJECT is hereby amended to change/clarify the following: 1. BID OPENING DATE has been changed to July 24, 2006, at 2 p.m., Eastern Standard Time. 2. Bid opening location: Building 101, Room 33, Perry Point, Maryland. 3. All questions must be submitted no later than July 14th at 3pm.  Questions submitted after that will not be answered.  RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED: Question 1:  The nine identical skylights at the Galleria are not dimensioned, with the exception of a reflected ceiling plan.  However, there is a non-dimensioned, x-section that scales larger than the roof plan indicates.  My question, therefore is, what is the outside curb dimension of the skylights? Answer: The skylight open, visible dimension is shown on the RCP, the curb detail and location is shown on detail 1, sheet 13.  I would not scale off of the building section. Question 2:  The drawings and specs are not clear as to what type of countertops are being requested. Answer: The base bid is solid surface wherever it is indicated on the finish schedule.  Bid No. 5 identifies that the plastic laminate should be used instead. Question 3: Drawing E5: Are there two (2) transformers (75 KVA and 112.5 KVA) existing or new?  Drawing E4 indicates the 75 KVA and the 112.5 KVA transformers as existing according to the symbol schedule on the legend, but no demolition is shown.  Answer: The 75 KVA Xfmr and 112.5 KVA Xfmr are both new. Question 4: Drawing E-10: Telephone Riser….there is a new 4” conduit being installed from the existing Room 1B133 to Room 1A113…is this correct? Answer: Yes, there is a new 4” conduit being installed from the existing Room 1B133 to Room 1A113. Question 5: Does this project involve blast mitigation aluminum windows? Answer: No, it does not.  Question 6:  Drawing 4 Keyed New Work Notes #1 references five (5) adj shelves per detail B10 sheet 20.  Should the reference be to detail A10 sheet 20? Answer: Yes. Question 7:  Room 1B165 appears to show casework in one corner; however, no elevations are shown. Answer: Please see elevation 1A/4/19 sim to exam room. Question 8:  Finish Schedule shows SS-1 and P.  Lam in room 1B156 – ADU Machine; however, no elevations shown.  Answer: No casework is required. Question 9: Restrooms are shown in elevation to be P. Lam., is this correct or is a solid surface to be used? Answer: P. Lam is what is shown on the drawings.  A/E does not remember why.  The A/E thinks solid surface would be more appropriate in this location.  Not sure if this was a budget choice.  Can not confirm sink type at this time. Question 10: Finish schedule show SS-1 and P. Lam in room 1D108-Tech Lab; however, there are no elevations shown. Answer: There is existing casework to be re-laminated to match the new finish scheme. Question 11: Tele/Elec rooms 1A129/17 show adj shelving; however, no other tele/elec rooms include shelving.  Is this correct? Answer: A/E does not see the reference to adjustable shelving in either closet 1A129 or 1A117.  There should not be shelving in this type of closet.  Perhaps you are reading the one hour rating note on the partition type as a note one for adjustable shelving?? Question 12: Window schedule and drawings do not indicate window sills.  What material is required? Answer: Detail 2/8/11 calls out painted wood sills as the typical wall section through a window. Question 13: Are three or four phases for this project.  Apparently there are conflicting statements in the drawings/specifications.  One place is drawing no. 3….key to phasing note.  Answer: There are only 3 phases.  At one point, there was four, but one was deleted.  I believe that there is a keyed note on sheet 3 that refers to contractor’s access during phases 3 and 4, and it should only read phase 3.

<DESC>THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM JUNE 26, 2006 TO NOVEMBER 13, 2006.  

Through this solicitation, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is seeking to establish and support several multi-disciplinary teams of biochemists and immunologists focused on the discovery of novel allergens and/or T cell epitopes that are recognized by different T cell subsets.  This solicitation will support two distinct areas of research. 

a)	Research Area 1:  Identification Validation, and Characterization of Novel Allergens – research projects to use established or innovative isolation and purification techniques to identify novel allergens from various sources.
b)	Research Area 2:  Identification and Validation of Allergen-Specific T Cell Epitopes – research projects to identify and characterize peptides containing T cell epitopes that activate allergen-specific effector T cells, and/or activate allergen-specific regulatory T cells. 

This resource reagent development initiative is an important component of the mission of the NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT), which is to promote the study of allergic diseases, define the mechanisms that underlie these diseases, and ultimately develop therapies for the treatment of these diseases.

5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the 
resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this 
acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict 
confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the 
ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting 
officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not 
participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or 
the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may 
refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their 
concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting 
officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone 
the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO 
bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of 
OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot 
be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the 
Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507         Symington  Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-   mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and

1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 
588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The ombudsman has no authority 
to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the ombudsman 
to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify 
technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>1. The 15 Contracting Squadron/LGCZ has the requirement to obtain support services for the Kenney Headquarters (KHQ)Pacific Air Operations Center (PAOC)Air Mobility Division (AMD). This is a recompetition of the former Air Mobility Operations Control Center (AMOCC) contract.  The Kenney Headquarters Pacific Air Operations Center (PAOC) Air Mobility Division (AMD) is Commander PACAF’s executive agent primarily responsible for Command and Control of PACAF and other (as specified) air mobility aircraft operating within the USPACOM AOR – both in peacetime and in crisis.  The PAOC AMD operates twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, including weekends and holidays. On a steady-state basis, the PAOC AMD oversees a variety of air mobility missions operating within an ever-changing scenario of theater environments, exercises, and day-to-day operations.  Primary AMD functions include planning, tasking, scheduling, coordinating, flight following, dispatching, and recovering PACAF assigned and gained air mobility aircraft.  In a theater crisis, the PAOC AMD continues to support steady-state operations while simultaneously mobilizing select ‘core’ AMD functionalities to focus on the urgency at-hand.  In such instances, the AMD integrates with global air mobility systems to enable a rapid and responsive transition from peacetime to contingency operations to efficiently and effectively accomplish the AMD mission in providing seamless global mobility.   

In addition to a small government contingent consisting of the AMD Chief, AMD Deputy, Senior Directors, Quality Assurance Personnel, Airlift Requirements, the Pacific Military Altitude Reservation Facility (PACMARF), and Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Cell personnel, the PAOC AMD is predominately made up of contract mission managers, dispatchers, airlift and tanker planners, operational support airlift schedulers, DV planners, logisticians, and internal staff support. 

A Statement of Work was posted on FedBizOps earlier. The NAICS code being used is 488190.  The RFP will be issued 12 Jul 06 with a closing date of 04 Aug 06.  Oral Presentations are estimated to begin about 07 Aug 06.

<DESC>Amendment 1 to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation FA8601-06-R-0054 posted 7-3-06
******************************
The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received after the posting of the solicitation.  The solicitation closing date remains unchanged.  All proposal packages are due NLT 2:00PM on 14 July 2006.
******************************
1.Question:  I wanted to confirm that the RFP is not a GSA buy, but a commercial purchase based on a FFP.  Please let me know.
Answer:  This is an open market buy.
******************************
2.Question:  Reference ASC Request: FA8601-06-R-0054 for Junior Financial Budget Analyst Support.  We are aware of three levels of Financial Budget Analyst: these are Entry, Journeyman, and Senior.  Would you please define “Junior”?  I was unable to find a definition in the PWS.
Answer:  A Junior Financial Budget Analyst is someone who has the knowledge of the tasks required in the Performance Work Statement.
******************************
3.Question:  Is there an incumbent for this work?  If so, what is their contract's value?
Answer:  The current contract was a one-year contract awarded under GSA contract to MCR Federal LLR at a cost of $110,000.00.
******************************
4.Question:  The current solicitation states that it is for two man years of effort per period.  I assume that this means the solicitation is for two resources.  For clarification, was the incumbent's contract for two man years of effort during one twelve month period?  Did they offer two resources for a total of $110,000?
Answer:  The current effort is a one year contract for $110,000.  Any additional information would need requested through the Freedom of Information Act.
******************************
5.Question:  Does the client already have a couple of people in mind for this contract?  We have found that most clients do.
Answer:  This is not a sole source requirement.  Competitive proposals are being solicited.
******************************
6.Question:  The solicitation requests a copy of the Representations and Certifications, however, none are attached to the solicitation.  Can we attach our ORCA reps and certs or will you be providing the attachment for the Reps and Certs.
Answer:  This was inadvertently overlooked with the posting of the solicitation.  Amendment 1 provides the Reps and Certs attachments.  The ORCA reps and certs can also be provided.
******************************
Complete proposal packages, including Price Proposal and Contract Data, Relevant Past and Present Performance , Mission/Technical Capability, Representations and Certifications,  and  Past Performance Questionnaires shall be submitted no later than 2:00pm (EST) on 14 July 2006 to Ms Jacque Davis, 88 CONS/PKB, 1940 Allbrook Drive, Suite 3, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-5309.

In advance of this, the contractor shall conduct a pilot conversion using up to 1,000 documents.     The contractor shall also convert up to 1,000 documents that have been updated while conversion is in progress.     Converted documents must be editable in the new MSWord system developed by CRS and be capable of rendering into HTML and PDF files using the new publishing tool developed by CRS.     Following conversion, the contractor shall render all converted documents into HTML, Web PDF, and print PDF formats using CRS's publishing tool and provide a quality assurance report.  An optional task is to convert up to 3,500 additional archived documents.

The following materials will be supplied upon request to interested and qualified vendors: the two current WordPerfect templates; the post-processing scripts applied to the WordPerfect documents during publishing; the MS Word template; the XML schema to be imported into and then applied to the MS Word template.     CRS will also provide a subset of CRS Reports for Congress in the WordPerfect version and a description of the full set of documents including detailed metrics (e.g. page counts, title lengths, number of authors etc.). Vendors may request materials from the contracting officer.     

Information shared with respondents shall be considered confidential; a nondisclosure agreement executed by an official of the firm or corporation will be required prior to release of such information.     

To receive the materials, vendors must provide complete contact information, including the name of the corporate officer to whom such items are to be delivered; the company name and street address (no P.O. box numbers), and the telephone number of the point of contact and an alternate who can assume responsibility for preserving the confidentiality of this information, if the primary contact is unavailable.

<DESC>This notice constitutes an Amendment to the previous synopsis that was issued in this publication on or about April 18, 2006.  The initial notice advised of the Defense Commissary Agency, Design and Construction Division (DeCA/CIED) plans to implement a follow on Streamlined Construction Improvement Program (SCIP II) to optimize construction delivery of proposed projects by award of approximately ten (10) multiple-awards, firm, fixed priced, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts in two cetegories.  One category covers Larger-Valued National Contracts with estimated project values over $7.5 Million and another will cover Lower-Valued National contracts with estimated project values under $7.5 Million.  By this notice DeCA is advising prospective offerors of the following changes to the proposed solicitation: (1) The contracts will be awarded for a basic period of five (5) years with additional five (5) one-year options in lieu of a three (3) year basic period with two (2) one year options. (2) The total program maximum will not exceed $1 Billion in lieu of the initial program maximum of $498 Million (3) Concurrent with the changes to the program duration and total program maximum, at this time, the magnitude of the ten-year program consists of approximately 40 projects estimated over $7.5 Million and 90 projects estimated at below $7.5 Million.  This is in lieu of the previous five year program estimates of approximately 20 projects over $7.5 Million and 45 projects below $7.5 Million (4) The government has expanded its consideration of recent experience to include projects that have a documented project history with on-going construction for at least six months or more than 50% complete or projects that have been completed within the past 8 years in lieu of 5 years.

<SUBJECT>R -- The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) is seeking a contractor to perform investment and recordkeeping tasks in support of the Court Registry Investment System.

<DESC>The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) is seeking a contractor to perform investment and recordkeeping tasks in support of the Court Registry Investment System (CRIS).  The Court Registry Investment System (CRIS) is a cash management system for court registry funds developed and tested by the Clerk, hereinafter called “CRIS Fund Manager”, of the United States District Court of the Southern District of Texas (TX-S), which is located in Houston.  The system began operations in 1988.  Currently there are twenty-three participating courts around the country.  As of June 30, 2005, the registry fund total for all federal courts was approximately $3.3 billion of which $1.8 billion was invested in CRIS.  

Securities purchased are normally held until maturity.  Safety of principal and liquidity of investments without sacrificing principal are among the more important objectives of the CRIS.  The Clerk of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Texas, known as the CRIS Fund Manager, seeks a contractor to assist in developing portfolio strategies to accomplish the objectives of CRIS, to advise on the selection of specific investments, to execute directed securities transactions, and to maintain case-by-case accounting records.

In brief, each week the CRIS Fund Manager is advised of new deposits and planned withdrawals.  The contractor will advise what security transactions, consistent with the CRIS objectives, are appropriate in these instances.  The CRIS Fund Manager will then direct the contractor to buy or sell specific securities.  Securities purchased by the contractor will be transferred to the CRIS account in the Securities Handling Resource-sharing Endeavour (SHARE) system maintained by the Federal Reserve.  Once confirmation of the transfer has been received from the Federal Reserve Bank an immediate payment (deposit) will be recorded in the contractor’s reserve account at the Federal Reserve Bank.  In those rare instances when securities must be sold prior to maturity, funds must be deposited in Treasury’s General Account at the Federal Reserve Bank prior to the securities being transferred from the CRIS account in SHARE.  Because monies remain on deposit with the Treasury and are never in possession of the contractor, there are no collateral requirements.  The contractor will next update individual case records by adding new deposits, subtracting withdrawals and allocating portfolio earnings.  A case investment report will then be mailed to each court member.  Other portfolio information and statistics will be provided to the CRIS Fund Manager on a regular basis.  The solicitation is scheduled to be released on or about August 1, 2006. The point of contact for this solicitation is Michelle Hupp, Contracting Officer, (202) 502-1574.

<CONTACT>JEAN SCHILLING CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3032369329     jschilli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>Sources Sought for HUBZone, 8(a), SDAV firms with qualifications to provide construction services for roof repair of USGS National Wetlands Research Center (NWRC), Lafayette, LA building(s).  Scope of Work from Architect's Field Report for corrective action: Location #1: Seal all gaps between base flashing membrane, metal counter flashing, and bottom of the wall cover plate as required for completing watertight transitions in the roof to wall and wall to wall flashing. Location #2:  Remove termination bar and roof edge counter flashing from plaster wall at southwest corner of MR1 to expose roof panel. Provide flashing behind roof panel vertical leg near overhang and up slope as required to replace any trimmed or insufficiently turned up edges along the wall, preventing water from washing over and behind same into building interior. Prior to replacing counter flashing, trim the end dam closure to allow flow of water, similar to the hemmed edge, open end installed on Area MR4. All materials should be thoroughly cleaned and new sealant of the appropriate type applied when re-installation occurs. The Owner should also authorize the roofing contractor to seal the counter flashing seam at the wall expansion joint. Location #3: Corrections will be similar to Location #2. Location #4: The Owner should authorize the roofing contractor to clean, install bond breaker material (backer rod) if required and reseal the gap between the bottom of the wall expansion joint and the metal counterflashing below to prevent the water flowing off MR3 from entering the building. The contractor should correct the end dam problem to prevent the channeling of the water down to that same spot similar to Location #2. Location #5: The contractor shall remove the fasteners and counterflashing, clean the southwest wall base flashing intersection and reseal completely. A backer plate or flashing should be fabricated to close the gap indicated between the wall panel (W4) and plaster wall counterflashing prior to reinstallation of same. The entire area should then be re-sealed for a watertight assembly. Location #6: The contractor shall investigate the damage to the two roof panels indicated on MR4 for repair or replacement in order to maintain the 20-year warranty issue. The installation defect was only noted upon this inspection when the metal-to-metal contact became perceived while walking over that area. The damage obviously occurred during construction. Concerns who feel that they can furnish the required services (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, reference material on past performance for similar type services, company government profile for set-aside program status, contact names, and such other materials that correspond to the required items to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  Therefore, requirements for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  Concerns have five working days from posting of this announcement to submit the information requested.   This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The US Department of Veterans Affairs, Austin Automation Center anticipates award to Incite Studios on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i).  It would take a new company 1 year and a significant undetermined cost to develop competitive specifications for this project. There is no known resource available to EES to develop the complex specifications that meet the compatibility requirements with the existing CPEP Performance Support System. The requested services have unique design performance specifications and quality requirements which are essential but not available in comparable products.  Incite Studios has developed customized RoboHelp capabilities that are included in all of our projects. Incite Studios was part of the design team that developed the CPEP Performance Support System and have the unique knowledge and practical experience working with the system to accomplish the associated task within the mandated time frame. The contracted services required revision training modules, development of training modules, and maintenance on all modules. Use of another contractor at this time would cause additional costs and significant time delay to the Government. Incite possess specialized knowledge of this major system of training modules for all VA Government Employees and without their continued services the Government would create a duplication of cost that could not be recovered through competition. For these reasons, Incite’s services are considered a logical follow on in accordance with FAR 6.301(a)(ii). Firms will be considered only if response is with clear and convincing evidence that the firm can efficiently provide the product being procured without duplication of cost and time. Responses must be received no later than 3:00pm cst July 16, 2006. The determination to open competition based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government. If a solicitation is issued, no additional synopsis will be published. Responses should be addressed to Shawn R. Reinhart, Contract Specialist, Ph: (512) 326-6025, Fx:(512) 326-6028, shawn.reinhart@va.gov

<SUBJECT>68 -- Chemicals used to clean the microfiltration membrane on the US Army and Marine Corp Tactical Water Purification System
<SOLNBR>N62473-06-TWPS
<RESPDATE>081506
<CONTACT>Carrie de Jesus, Contract Specialist, Phone 805-982-5095, Fax 805-982-4540, Email carrie.dejesus@navy.mil
<DESC>The objective of this Sources Sought is to identify suppliers for chemicals used to clean the microfiltration membrane on the US Army and Marine Corps Tactical Water Purification System (TWPS).  The TWPS currently uses 12 polypropylene microfiltration (MF) membranes made by US Filter MEMCOR as the pretreatment system to the reverse osmosis (RO) membranes.

The cleaning procedures for the MF membranes are to use a low pH (approx 2.5) cleaner followed by a high pH (approx 12.5) cleaner. The cleaning solution volume is 130 gallons and chemicals will be mixed with reverse osmosis product water with a TDS less than 1000 mg/L.  Approximately 20 lbs of citric acid is used as a low pH cleaner.  Currently, the high pH chemical cleaner is a mixture of 30 lbs of a proprietary membrane cleaner (ethylenediamine tetracetic acid (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), phosphate, percarbonate) and 4 gallons of 50 percent volume sodium hydroxide.  Each cleaning solution is heated to approximately 100 degree F and recirculated through the microfiltration membranes for 30 minutes.

It is desired to identify potential sources of supply for a high pH chemical cleaner to reduce the life cycle costs on the TWPS.  The following characteristics and capabilities of the required high pH chemical cleaner are as follows:

A single high pH chemical cleaner is required instead of a mixture; The pH of the high pH chemical cleaner solution when combined with the low pH citric acid solution shall be between 6 and 9; The cleaner must be low foaming; The elimination or reduction of sodium hydroxide from the cleaning process is desired for safety reasons; Chemical cleaner must not cause any damage to the polypropylene MF MEMCOR membrane; 
Chemical cleaners must be compatible with reverse osmosis membranes such that trace amounts will NOT cause damage.  No chlorine-based cleaners are allowed; Chemical cleaners should minimize environmental and safety hazard and shall not contain EDTA or NTA; Chemical cleaners and preservatives shall be capable of long-term storage (2-year shelf life minimum, 5-year desirable) without degradation of performance; Chemical cleaners shall satisfactorily remove organic and biological foulants from the MF fibers; 
Powder form of chemical cleaner is preferred; Required packaging size is 5 gallon durable plastic pail (40 lbs) at a price no greater than $150.

Interested vendors shall submit the following:

a)	Technical data sheet on chemical cleaners with full disclosure of ingredients
b)	Material Safety Data Sheet 
c)	Proposed pricing for 5 gallon pail (40 lbs).      
d)	Availability of chemicals (timeframe)

Upon request the government would like a sample of chemical to evaluate its effectiveness as a membrane cleaner.

<DESC>Pending the availability of funding, the US Department of Education intends to issue a sole source purchase order to The National Academy of Sciences (NAS).  NAS has previously convened two meetings to solicit experts' suggestions for developing evaluation criteria and meta-analytic procedures that will support a forthcoming US Department of Education initiative - the NCLB Promising Practices Initiative (PPI).  The Department intends to award a sole source procurement to NAS to convene a panel of experts for a third meeting on the PPI.  In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the Contracting Officer has determined that only one source, NAS, is reasonably available to meet this requirement.

The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters.  The Academy was established to “investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art” whenever called upon by any department of the Government. In 1916, it expanded to include the National Research Council; in 1964, the National Academy of Engineering; and in 1970, the institute of Medicine. These organizations are collectively called the National Academies.

The Department requires independent, unique, objective, authoritative technical advice so that it can make the necessary policy decisions.  The Academy has a reputation that is unparalleled. Because the Department is charting new territory with the NCLB Promising Practices Initiative, it is imperative that the contractor involved in this task be credible and well respected amongst the general public, but particularly within the scientific community. The National Academy is highly regarded by all.  It has the gravitas to be heard. In Executive Order 12832 of January 19, 1993, President George W.H. Bush cited the Academy's preeminent position in research and education, charging the NAS's National Research Council with duties that have "the object of increasing knowledge, of strengthening the national security...and of contributing in other ways to the public welfare."  The Department intends to execute this purchase order on or before August 12, 2006.

TACOM-RI is conducting this additional market research, to determine whether there are qualified SB manufacturers who can provide this item with a better delivery schedule, lower price and higher product quality than the current contractor, Federal Prison Industries (FPI).  Interested and Qualified SB manufacturers should make a through review of all the provisions of the Request For Proposal (RFP), paying specific attention to the clause provisions,  attachments and supporting  documents, including the var ious requirements of the Technical Data Package Listing (TDPL), to include any required certifications on parts or materials. If, upon review, you are interested in competing for this contract, you should forward a written statement of interest as delineat ed below to the Point of Contact (POC) listed herein.  These statements of interest or intent shall clearly define how you will be able to improve on the current delivery schedule and price, and meet or exceed the current quality requirements of the item. INDICATOR CONTROL SUBASSEMBLY:  As originally described in the 06 April 2006 FedBizOps Announcement, the item is a cable assembly consisting of a 3 strand wire, 3 connectors, and one photo-electric control component.  Three of the parts listed in the TDPL,  (P/Ns 12293286, 12308713, and 2590039) must be acquired from specific source controlled suppliers. In submitting your statement of interest, any proposed prices shall use quotes for these products only as purchased directly from these Source Controlled pr oviders. The Government currently does not have any program funds or any intent to qualify new venders or sources and consequently the requirement to use these sources will be strictly enforced during contract performance. NOTICE:  TACOM-RI does not have access to, nor maintain any computer aided design drawings (CADD), including Gerber Files or Stable Based MYLAR drawings for this item.   SOLICITATION TERMS:  Although the solicitation is presently set-aside for Total Small Business Concerns that set-aside action was based on the Contracting Officer's initial determination that SB manufacturers could meet the Government's terms for delivery,  and for the quality standards of the TDPL.  That initial determination maybe reassessed based on information obtained from this notice.  The item's quality standards are listed, either directly or as referenced Military or Industry Standards, throughout t he TDPL and the RFP.  The Contract's delivery terms are specified in the RFP, Page 2, Section A - Supplemental Information, Paragraph 13, and are also listed in Section B - Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs.   The solicitation also requires that the su ccessful offeror have a fully compliant ISO 9001:2000 Quality Assurance program fully developed and in place at the time of award. ANTICIPATED CONTRACT:  Any anticipated future action(s) which may result from this announcement (regardless of the final set-aside determination) will be for a fixed quantity, at a fixed price.  The current estimated requirement is for 809 items.  No optio n quantities are anticipated at this time.  Delivery terms will be FOB-Destination, to several potential DoD facilities within CONUS.  First Article Testing (FAT) will be required of any First Time Producers of this item.  The FAT requirement will include manufacturers' direct certifications that source controlled, and other listed Qualified supplier parts are being supplied for incorporation i nto the final assembly.  Certifications from supplier firms  manufacturers certified or not - WILL NOT SUFFICE as the required manufacturer's certification.  WRITTEN STATEMENT OF INTEREST from Small Business Manufacturers:  Qualified and capable SB manufacturers are to forward their written statement of positive interest, qualifications, and capabilities in performing all aspects of the anticipated contract.  E mailed statements are the preferred medium, to buebec@ria.army.mil.  However, telefaxed statements, to (309) 782-0794 - Attn: C. Buebe, are also acceptable.  This positive statement of interest should include, as a minimum, the Concerns qualifications as a Small Business contractor; the Concern's capabilities to meet the quality standards of the TDPL and compliance with ISO 9001:2000; the Concerns best estimated delivery terms for the total quantity of 809 items (exp., 100 units by the 100th day After Rec eipt of Order, then 200 units every 30 days thereafter); the Concern's ability to pursue and successfully complete the FAT requirements; the Concern's CAGE Code; a concise listing, with references, of prior contracts to manufacture and supply similar cable  assemblies; the Concern's current listing of certified NAICS, SIC, PSC, and FSC Codes.  Also, interested SB manufacturers are to provide a Range Order of Magnitude (ROM) of their anticipated price, on a per unit basis with an extended total price.  This R OM price may be cited in various formats, like a small range amount with a minimum or maximum unit price such as between $400 to $425 each or an exact unit price dollar figure. If offerors provide such a large unit price spread as to make the information  useless to the reviewing contracting officer, the Government reserves the right not to consider that information as part of the Governments analysis. Any Statements of Positive Interest from SB manufacturers are to be received by the deadline date listed  above.  Any information obtained is for the sole purpose of gathering sufficient information for the Contracting Officer to complete the intended additional market research and any information provided will not be binding to either the respondent firm or the Government.  Based on a review of all the information received as part of the market research effort (or lack thereof, if insufficient interest is received, or if it is determined that responsive SB manufacturers did not substantiate that they can improve on the delive ry terms and price and equal or exceed the quality, of the incumbent contractors), the Contracting Officer shall make a determination relative to the subject solicitation action. Any decision will be considered final, and not subject to further review or a ppeal.  If it is determined that there is sufficient interest from qualified Small Business manufacturers, the solicitation will remain as a small business set-aside procurement action, with the single exception of the incumbent contractor (FPI) and it sha ll proceed  without further notice.

NASA seeks through the solicitation to select a forward-looking, creative, and highly-capable developer who is adept at planning and delivering projects that foster entrepreneurial opportunity while honoring the environment.  NASA intends to select a Master Developer of Exploration Park, whose role and responsibility will be to: •	Define a  Master Development Plan for the entire park, including planned phasing •	Define and implement  detailed development plans to integrate all of the initial infrastructure and building projects and those of any subsequent phases; •	Provide full financial, management, and project integration resources to design and deliver the enabling site improvements to facilitate initial and any subsequent phase projects, including any build-to-suit projects and/or spec buildings to be constructed and owned by the Master Developer; •	Assure that all development in Exploration Park is consistent with design standards and implementation approaches proposed by the Master Developer and accepted by NASA; •	Establish and sustain an Exploration Park operations and management structure that ensures a well maintained, quality development. NASA plans to negotiate a long-term lease and development agreement, up to 75 years in term, and offer immediate and future development rights consistent with the site boundaries and conditions defined for the Exploration Park project. Prospective tenants and/or site developers with a specific project interest who wish to participate in Exploration Park but who do not wish to be considered as the Master Developer are encouraged to express their interest, and NASA will accept such information for the Master Developer ultimately selected.  The Master Developer will have the right to sublease space in multi-tenant projects or improved sites for the development and use of improvements built by others. An Exploration Park Industry Day will be held at KSC on August 10, 2006, as described in the draft solicitation, to provide industry representatives an opportunity to attend a site tour and participate in a briefing on Exploration Park.  All industry comments to the draft RFP that are received by August 17, 2006, will be considered.  NASA anticipates issuing a final RFP on or about August 31, 2006.

<SUBJECT>A -- Tactical Interoperability Communications Plans (TICP) Testing and Evaluation for the Office of Interoperability and Compatibility Program
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Systems Engineering Development, Science and Technology intends to procure on a sole source basis from Morgan Franklin Corporation 1753 Pinnacle Drive, Suite 1200, Mclean VA 22102.  The Office for Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) Program has a requirement to support the Department’s primary interoperable communications initiative, led by the Office of Grants and Training (G&T).  75 urban areas and states (called UASIs) have been identified as being at a high risk for a man made or natural disasters.  The most critical component in the response and management of a disaster is reliable communications.  To improve the effectiveness of DHS grants, all 75 UASIs are required to inventory and document their communication capabilities as part of a Tactical Interoperability Communications Plans (TICP). Over the next four months, G&T and the OIC will test and evaluate components of the TCIP to understand each UASI’s communication capabilities and to provide recommendations to the UASIs for improving their capabilities.  OIC has been tasked by the Secretary of DHS to provide subject matter experts to conduct the testing and evaluation. 

The required services entail leveraging existing relationships with emergency responders in UASIs, and testing and evaluating the tactical radio communication exercises being carried out across the United States in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security, Directorate for Preparedness, Office of Grants and Training (G&T).  It will be the largest set of interoperable communications exercises ever conducted.  The firm capable of fulfilling these requirements must have significant experience interacting and negotiating interoperable communications requirements in an operational environment with key stakeholders in major urban areas (such as chiefs of police, fire, etc).  Through its TCIP guidance and the Secretary’s remarks to state and local officials, the Department has made it clear that G&T and SAFECOM would use trusted and independent parties to evaluate the TCIPs.  The firm must also have expertise in testing and evaluating large scale heterogeneous land mobile radio networks.  Each of the 75 UASI locations has unique land mobile radio architecture.  The firm must also be able to meet the Department’s urgent time requirements.  

SED intends to award within 45 days of the date of this notice.  This is not a request for quotes; however, sources that feel that they also are capable of fulfilling these requirements may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their capabilities by 2:00 p.m. Friday, July 21, 2006.  This information may also be considered for future procurements.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and may be sent via email to tisha.blue@dhs.gov or faxed at (202) 254-5396.  No phone calls will be accepted.  If no other responses are received, award will be made on the intended award date.

<SUBJECT>D -- Midcourse Space Experiment Vehicle (MSX) Contract
<DESC>Notice of Proposed Contract Action Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will receive no response.  This Proposed Contract Action is published to notify potential sources of the Government’s intent to modify the existing sole-source contract awarded to Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) by adding additional performance periods.  The resultant contract extensions will be Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) for up to an additional twenty-four months for a total contract performance period of five (5) years.  The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) Code is 517910 “Other Telecommunications”.  On 28 Dec 2005, the Government provided notice for an anticipated follow-on contract.  The information received from the previous notice provided valuable information and will be utilized to support the Market Research requirements imposed by FAR 5.201.  Several interested parties responded with an expressed interest to provide the services specified and provided capabilities briefings to demonstrate their knowledge and expertise.  The capabilities briefings afforded the opportunity for information exchange between the parties, for which the Government could express the unique circumstances surrounding the MSX program and its resources (i.e. 10 meter dish, acquiring associated peripheral equipment/services and the budget/financial issues).  As a result of this exchange, the Government decided based upon responses from the potential offerors expressing an interest, that the cost/schedule and performance period contemplated presented too great a risk and too little time for offeror’s to recoup their initial investment in this endeavor.

Based upon the information contained herein, the Governments supports the findings specified in FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, the incumbent contractor, JHU/APL, pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1).  A contract modification is contemplated for the continuance of supplies and services utilizing the existing contract under the original terms and conditions and shall not exceed the statutory performance period imposed by law for service contracts.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN06-31 - CORONET PROPOSER'S DAY
<DESC>PROPOSERS’ DAY CONFERENCE:

DARPA will host a Proposers’ Day Conference in support of BAA 06-29, Dynamic Multi-Terabit Core Optical Networks: Architecture, Protocols, Control and Management (CORONET), on August 8, 2006 at the Dulles Airport Marriott, 45020 Aviation Drive, Dulles, Virginia 20166, from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.  Check-in begins at 7:00 am.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the CORONET program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:

The objective of the CORONET program is to develop the architecture, protocols, and control and management software for highly dynamic, multi-terabit global core optical networks with greatly enhanced performance, security and survivability.  An important part of the CORONET vision is to enable ultra-fast service set-up/tear-down as well as very fast recovery from multiple network failures.  It is envisioned that the majority of traffic on the network will be Internet Protocol (IP), directly over optical Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), with a substantial amount of wavelength service traffic as well.  It is the ultimate goal of this program to transition the CORONET technology, at the end of Phase 2, to commercial telecommunications carriers.

It is anticipated that a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the CORONET program will be released prior to the conference.  This BAA will encourage proposals that include (but are not limited to) the following technology areas: Dynamic, Multi-Terabit Optical Network Architecture, IP-over-WDM Network Architecture, Multi-Layer (IP/Optical) Network Optimization, Optical Network Restoration/Protection, Optical Network Protocol Design and Optimization, Optical Network Control and Management, Multi-Layer Control and Management Plane Optimization, High-Availability Software Design, and Emulation/Simulation of Network Data, Control and Management Planes.  

It is anticipated that the CORONET program will be conducted in two sequential phases.  The forthcoming BAA will be open for three (3) years, and is seeking a comprehensive and integrated solution for each of the two sequential phases of the program.  A separate selection round will take place for each phase of the program.  Proposals addressing only a subset of the topics will be considered non-responsive to the BAA.  As such, teaming of proposers to assemble the necessary breadth and depth of expertise and resources will be recommended.  Potential proposers are encouraged to use the Proposers' Day Conference to discuss their organization's capabilities and explore teaming arrangements with other conference attendees.

In Phase 1 of the CORONET program, the performers will develop the architecture, protocols and algorithms necessary to deliver the program’s network performance objectives.  Phase 1 will be conducted over an 18-month period, which will conclude with extensive simulations to verify achievement of the performance objectives.  A deliverable at the end of Phase 1 will be a full proposal for Phase 2.  In Phase 2, the selected performers will develop the network control and management software and verify its performance to the Government and to commercial telecommunications carriers through appropriate testing.  Proposal instructions for each phase are addressed in the Proposer’s Information Pamphlet (PIP), which will be published with the BAA.

    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent for the procurement of commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are not being requested for the solicitation number NOI6065.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561990, which has a business size standard of $6.5M.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to award a sole-source procurement to Department of Microbiology and Instituto de Ciencias Neurologicas, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.  This is a protocol designed to research the effects and possible treatment of neurocysticercosis.  The objective is to develop a program to serve as the basis for rational approaches to treatment.  Work is to be performed in Peru to understand the pathophysiology of disease in neurocysticercosis.  The goal of this program at GPS and HIS/LPD is to understand the nature of the immune responses in acute and chronic cysticercosis, and to identify methods and chemotherapeutic agents to limit harmful inflammatory responses due to the natural course of the disease or following anthelmintic treatment.  The intent is also to perform studies in pigs and humans and in vitro with collaborators in Lima, Peru.  These experiments aim to answer questions regarding pathogenetic mechanisms; attempt to determine the most effectiveness of treatments; and to gain a better understanding of the immune response of the host.  Planned studies in Peru include: 1) Serial immunological studies of patients with neurocysticercosis.  Immunological profiles of cells in peripheral blood and CSF, where possible, at presentation, treatment and post treatment.  These profiles will be correlated with the clinical picture, radiological analysis and peripheral and/or CSF cysticercosis antigen levels.  2) Similar analysis of patients with calcific neurocysticercosis with and without perilesional edema.  3)  Serial immunological and immunohistological evaluations of T. solium infected pigs before, during and after treatment.  Analysis of the use of immunosuppressive agents on treatment efficacy and the course of disease.  4) In vitro analysis of the effects of immunosuppressive, antiseizure medications, various combinations of anthelmintcs on T. solium cysts.  These studies are designed to determine the immunological profiles during the course of the natural disease and following treatment in humans and pigs and to determine the usefulness of prospective immunosuppressive drugs and regiments in vivo.  The period of performance will be from the date of award to March 31, 2007.  The proposed contract is for services and related supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  See Numbered Note 22.  The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212.3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contractor Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items.  Copies of the aforementioned clauses are available upon request by telephone to Ms. Tonia Alexander at (301) 496-2607.  In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a).  This document can be accessed by internet at http://orca.bpn.gov/ and must be included with the offeror's proposal which should be submitted no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on July 27, 2006 to Tonia Alexander.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation, a simplified acquisition under FAR part 13 and a total small business set-aside. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a requirement for focus group research to deal with medical devices. In recent years, a number of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemakers have been recalled. Recalls of implanted devices prove to be a challenging risk communication issue. FDA would like patients to have the most timely, complete, balanced risk information about their medical devices, both implanted and non-implanted devices, without unduly alarming patients who depend on them. In this study, we will conduct a series of six (6) focus groups with patients with medical devices and caregivers who help in healthcare decision-making for patients who have medical devices. FDA will use the information from these focus groups in order to design appropriate risk communication information for consumers. The objective of the focus group study is to explore consumers' information needs regarding safety information about their medical devices. We will conduct a total of six (6) focus groups with nine (9) participants per group. Two (2) groups will consist of patients who have ICDs and pacemakers and caregivers who help in healthcare decision-making for patients with ICDs and pacemakers, two (2) will consist of patients with implanted devices other than ICDs and pacemakers and caregivers who help in healthcare decision-making for patients with implanted devices other than ICDs and pacemakers, and two (2) groups will consist of patients who use non-implanted devices in their daily lives and caregivers who help in healthcare decision-making for patients with non-implanted devices. The caregivers will not be those who help in the healthcare decision-making for the patients who participate in the group. Each group will discuss their own risk information needs or the needs of those patients they care for. The responses gained through these focus groups will be used to help FDA develop outreach materials for patients. SCOPE OF WORK: No work described in this section is to begin until FDA receives clearance of the project from OMB and FDA's Research in Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC). The Contractor will furnish the necessary personnel, services and facilities to recruit participants and conduct six (6) focus groups. Each group is expected to last 90 minutes. The focus group sessions shall be audio-taped, and the Contractor will provide a written topline report and transcripts within three weeks following the conduct of each focus group. All records containing participants' names must not be transmitted to the FDA and must be destroyed as soon as possible to ensure anonymity of participants. Responsibilities of FDA: Prepare screening tool and moderator's guide; Obtain all necessary RIHSC and OMB clearances. Responsibilities of the Contractor: After consultation with FDA/CDRH, develop and submit to FDA/CDRH, no later than 14 days after the award a written plan and timeline for accomplishing the work; Recruit 12 participants per group in order to obtain 9 participants, to account for no-shows; Report to FDA on status of recruitment; Schedule ICD/pacemaker focus groups to take place in afternoon sessions, with other groups scheduled for evening sessions; Review moderator's guide, and any other accompanying background materials, to prepare for the focus group sessions; Provide focus group facility; Provide taxi services for participants who do not have their own transportation; Provide a waiting room and refreshments for any drivers of participants who do not have their own transportation and do not wish to use taxi service; Conduct six (6) focus groups; Provide refreshments to the focus group participants; Provide incentive payments of $75 to each participant; Audiotape the focus group sessions; and Provide all transcripts, reports and deliverables. REPORTS AND DELIVERABLES: 1. Project report: six paper copies and one electronic copy of a report describing details of all aspects of the project; a. Recruitment and screening procedures, which FDA will provide to the contractor; b. Final number of participants in each group; c. Moderator's guide; d.Preparation and processing of transcripts; e.Topline report analyzing major themes noted by the moderator in the focus groups; 2. Two (2) copies per group of typed transcripts of the focus groups. Performance of this task order shall begin on a date to be negotiated and shall not extend beyond 90 days from the date of the start of the focus groups. Offerors shall submit technical proposals to demonstrate their ability to perform the work. Technical merit will be assessed on the following factors: 40% Documented experience in successful recruitment of consumers of medical devices for focus group participation. Experience overcoming recruitment difficulties to achieve desired number of participants; 20% Documented experience recruiting and screening potential participants for focus groups that concern emotional, high stress, or sensitive issues; 20% Documented experience in moderating focus groups when the consumers are likely to respond very emotionally to high stress or sensitive issues, as well as experience moderating medical topic focus groups with consumers; and 20% Documented availability of a state-of-the-art focus group facility that is accessible for people with disabilities. A separate pricing proposal must be submitted itemizing projected costs required to complete the work. Cost realism will be analyzed to determine the offeror's understanding of the requirement as well as to evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed price. A Time-and-Materials or firm fixed price award is anticipated, with a monthly payment schedule corresponding to the offeror's anticipated monthly costs or cash flow or corresponding to progress achieved, except that not less than 5 percent of the negotiated price shall be withheld pending acceptance of the final report and all raw data. Payment of monthly invoices will depend on acceptance by the Project Officer of the progress reported. This is a best buy acquisition in which technical factors are significantly more important than all other factors including price and past performance. Award will be made using SF1449 as a bilateral purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures; all relevant required clauses will apply. FAR clause 52.212-1 at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/current/html/52_212_213.html shall be included as well as 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items and 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items. Proposals must be submitted in electronic form to Robert.Julia@fda.hhs.gov. Hardcopy proposals will be accepted at the contracting office address set forth above, marked for Robert Julia, but electronic versions of all documents must be provided unless physically impossible (drawings or designs that cannot be created electronically or scanned). Proposals are due not later than 4:30pm Wednesday July 26, 2006. Questions concerning this acquisition should be submitted by email to Mr. Julia within four days following this announcement; answers will be provided as an amendment to this combined synopsis/solicitation.

(a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and th rough the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both ga tes are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours. These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holid ays.

Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained. All commercial v ehicles will be searched. The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post. The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis. If the commercial veh icle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that t he vehicle will be given priority. On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12 foot-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate. D rivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12 feet-5inches in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis. The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label. T he Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis. (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor veh icles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta. During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate. All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain v isitor passes. Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Mad igan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.

Local clause 52.111-4132 states: a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.

If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee. If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtainin g a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee. c. If an em ployee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change. If the ide ntification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain ent rance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide responses to the questions received.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

CLIN 0001 (quantity: 4 skds): 13x18 Paper, Gloss two-sided 40M, 25.6K shts per box (80 lb. Gloss two sided 40M Smooth Finish Long Grain)
Normal packaging for a sheet this size, in an 80 lb Cover stock is approximately 1000 sheets per carton or box. 
PLEASE PROVIDE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHEETS NEEDED/REQUIRED TO fulfill your requirement for this item: 
204,800 Total Sheets needed 

CLIN 0002 (quantity: 3 skds): 13x18, Gloss two-sided cover, 9.6K per box (100 lb. Gloss, two-sided Cover Finish Long Grain)
Normal packaging for a sheet this size, in a 100 lb Cover stock is approximately 1000 sheets per carton or box. 
PLEASE PROVIDE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHEETS NEEDED/REQUIRED TO fulfill your requirement for this item: 28,800 Total Sheets needed 

CLIN 0003 (quantity: 16 skds): 13x18 Paper, 40K shts per box (Smooth Offset, 60 lb. Smooth Finish Long Grain). 
Normal packaging for a sheet this size, in a 60 lb Cover stock is approximately 2000 sheets per carton or box. 
PLEASE PROVIDE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHEETS NEEDED/REQUIRED TO fulfill your requirement for this item: 400,000 Total Sheets needed
Is this paper to be bulk packed on a skid or packed in cartons? CLIN 0001 reads 25.6K per box and I'm thinking it may be per skid, CLIN 0002 reads 9.6K per box and CLIN 0003 reads 40K per box and maybe it means per skid. Per skid, it is put in boxes of 1000 usually but as long as it is boxed, the requirement is met and the total is also met- so the per box amount is not important
Could the size be 13.25x18.125 or is it exactly 13x18?  The uncoated needs to be 13 X 18 but the coated needs to be 13.25 X 18.125
On line item # 3 Is it an uncoated smooth offset?  Uncoated 

Is there a specific brightness that these sheets are supposed to be? Waiting to get the brightness of what is currently being used.
Is there a recycled content minimum that has to be met? No 
When the quantity of 4 skids is used, is that assuming a 2000 lb. pallet? 2500 sheets per box/ 40 boxes per skid

<DESC>Questions and Answers Regarding USCG Solicitation HSCG23-06-R-DPP035

The following list contains the questions received from Offerors to date and includes the specific response for each question.  Any additional questions from Offerors must be received by our office no later than 10:00am on July 14, 2006.  Additional questions received by that date/time will be posted with responses as soon as practical after receipt on that day.

1. A general reading of the solicitation implies that the training will occur at government facilities. Yet the contractor is responsible for "facilities" as stated in Section 04 of Amendment #2. Does "facilities" mean training/conference rooms? If true, these costs could easily exceed instructional costs, and rooms could be impossible to reserve given the short period of time to respond to task orders.  If not true, what "facilities" are the contractor responsible for?

Answer: The Coast Guard will furnish all facilities (training and conference rooms) for the courses.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing the Coast Guard facility with the specific requirements for providing the course – i.e. size and number of rooms required.

2. Are price increases provided for in the optional years, or are the offerors to build cost increases into their bid?

Answer: Per the solicitation, the Offeror shall provide a proposal for the T&M CLINS using labor types/categories, price per hour for those labor categories, the total number of hours proposed for each labor category, the total price for each labor category, the total price for materials as applicable, and the total overall price for each T&M CLIN to include all option periods. Offerors shall provide a proposal for the FFP CLINS/SubCLINS, giving a price per course convening to include the cost for the instructors and training materials for the course, and a total for the maximum number of courses that may be provided under each CLIN/SubCLIN to include all option periods.  The prices used in this procurement shall be those offered in the winning proposal.

3. Is the contractor responsible for copying and providing course materials for the students (student workbooks, binders, etc.)?

Answer: Yes, the Contractor is responsible for providing all course materials for the students (student workbooks, binders, etc.) except for the Incident Management Handbook which will be provided by the Coast Guard.

4. Will travel costs be permitted in the bids for the T&M CLIN's (#2, 3 and 4)?

Answer:  The work required under the T&M CLINS will require travel on an occasional basis and this travel will be reimbursed on monthly invoices based on the travel rates allowed under the Federal Travel Regulations.  In pricing their proposals, Offerors shall use the travel ceiling prices as listed in the answer to question 5 for the travel under the T&M CLINS.


5. Since the solicitation is silent on locations for the training, accurate bidding for travel costs is not possible. Will the estimated travel costs in bids for both FFP and T&M CLIN's be adjusted (up or down) based on actual Federal Travel Regulation costs at the time of payment? Do you have more refined guidance to help offerors submit more responsive travel costs in their bids?

Answer:  Generally, the designated USCG training locations will be in cities in the U.S and its territories where USCG Sectors, Districts, and Areas are located.  Due to the difficulty in estimating Offeror travel costs, ceiling prices for the travel costs associated with the Firm Fixed Price CLINs per year, are as follows:

Base year:	$241,000.00
Option Year One:	$231,400.00
Option year Two:	$406,141.00
Option Year Three:	$428,573.00
Option Year Four:	$524,682.00

Offerors shall use the following travel ceiling prices in pricing their proposals.  When notification is provided as to the location of the upcoming course, the contractor will provide an estimate for travel costs and per diem to that location based on the standard per diem and travel rates found in the Federal Travel Regulations.  Travel costs will be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) and will be reimbursed on a monthly basis via invoice. 

6. Will all face-to-face Project Manager meetings with the USCG be in Washington D.C.?

Answer: Project Manager meetings with the USCG will usually be at the USCG Headquarters in Washington, D.C., although occasionally these meetings may be held at USCG Training Center Yorktown, in Yorktown, Virginia.

7. Does Section 3.4 include a Coast Guard "course coordinator" that will be available to the contractor to finalize training schedules and assure successful outcomes?

Answer: Yes, the Coast Guard COTR will finalize training schedules, review and approve course revisions, review and approve new course materials, etc. In addition, for each course convening, the Coast Guard will assign a local “course coordinator” for each specific location.  The local course coordinator will work with the contractor on finalizing the training schedule with respect to the specific start and stop times on the contracted dates and to finalize training location/facility.

8. I’m in the initial research stage of solicitation # HSCG23-06-R-DPP035 found on FedBizOpps, and was hoping you could provide an estimated value for this opportunity.

Answer: Per the solicitation, the total value, or the total contract ceiling, of this procurement is derived by multiplying the maximum FFP quantities by their respective unit prices and then summing those totals along with the T&M ceiling prices.  The individual contract line item prices are those provided by the Offeror in their proposal, and the value of this procurement will be the total price offered in the successful proposal.

9.  Do any (or all) of the courses need to be updated before training can begin?

Answer:  Yes, a minimum of two and a maximum of four courses will require revisions to course materials before they can be presented during the base period of the contract.  

10. Who will be the USCG POC for Instructional Design Support?

Answer: The USCG POC for Instructional Design Support will be identified at the kick off meeting to the successful Offeror.

11. Is there an incumbent firm that has been performing this or any related work?

Answer: Emergency Management Services International (EMSI) Incorporated performed similar work under contract for the Coast Guard.

12.  Where are the designated USCG training locations?

Answer:  Generally the designated USCG training locations will be in cities in the U.S. and its territories where USCG Sectors, Districts, and Areas are located, but may also be other cities as determined by USCG needs.  Based on a current contract for similar services, the following is a list of locations and the courses presented at those locations during the previous 24 months:

Location	Number of Courses
 Alameda, CA 	9
Anchorage, AK	2
Baltimore, MD	1
Boston, MA	1

13.  How many Contractor-provided instructors do you require on-site (per-course)?

Answer:  Offerors shall determine the best mix of instructor personnel and staff to provide the training courses and fulfill the requirements of the contract.

14.  Does the USCG use a standard Performance Requirements Summary (PRS)?  May we have a copy of the PRS table for review?

Answer:  The USCG does not have a standard PRS.  Each task order issued under this contract will include a PRS that is specific to that task order.  In general the PRS, which sets forth the expected outcomes (requirements), will include a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan that details performance standards with incentives for exceeding or failing to meet the performance standards.  The PRS will be discussed with the contractor prior to the work being performed under each specific task order.

15.  Is the number of labor hours the same for each T&M CLIN (e.g. 3,000 each for the base period) or is it to be divided among the T&M CLINS at the offeror’s discretion (e.g. 1,000 hours each for CLINS 00002, 00003 & 00004 for the base period)?

Answer: The labor hours listed are the ceiling hours for that contract period.  For the base period the ceiling is 3,000 hours total for all T&M CLINS, and Offerors shall assign those labor categories and hours to the individual CLINS as needed to provide these services in the most effective and efficient manner.

16.  You have left the labor category mix for the T&M CLINS up to the offerors without an adequate description of the work to be performed under each of these CLINS.  Please provide estimates of the number of hours that you will require under each labor category for each CLIN so that when you assess the total prices the offerors will have bid on the same work.  Otherwise, we suggest that you provide detailed performance-based descriptions of the functions required to be performed and ask for fixed prices for completing each task instead of labor rates.

Answer:  Offerors shall assign those labor categories and hours to the individual T&M CLINS as needed to provide these services in an effective and efficient manner.  The services required under these CLINS are as described in the combined synopsis/solicitation and Amendments.

17.  Should travel costs be included in the T&M CLINS or will travel be reimbursed as you state in paragraph 1.9 of the first amendment?  And, if offerors should include travel costs in their T&M prices, please provide the destinations and time of year so that all offerors are bidding on the same basis.

Answer:  Please see the responses to questions 4 and 5.

18.  In the fourth paragraph of the Description, you have instructed offerors to include the costs for travel in their proposals for the FFP CLINS/SubCLINS without providing any guidance where the courses will be held.  How do you reconcile this with the statement in paragraph 1.9 of the first amendment, which states that travel will be reimbursed?  If travel is to be included in the price proposals this puts the offerors in a position to base their offers on guesses that will prevent you from conducting a fair price comparison.  How do we estimate travel costs to an unknown location and unknown time of year?  What are the guidelines for determining travel costs?

Answer:  Offerors shall provide a proposal for the FFP CLINS/SubCLINS giving a price per course convening, and a total for the maximum number of courses that may be provided under each CLIN/SubCLIN.  Offerors shall use the travel ceiling prices and information contained in these Question sand Answers to price their proposals.  An amendment to the solicitation will be issued within 24 hours to change the solicitation to reflect the information contained in this answer.

19.  In Amendment 2, paragraph 4.0, you state that the contractor shall furnish all facilities.  Again, this will cause the offerors to propose prices based on unequal assumptions.  How do we estimate facility costs to an unknown location and unknown time of year?  What are the guidelines for determining facility costs?

Answer:  The FFP CLIN courses will be taught at government facilities and classroom space will be provided for these courses.  Therefore, contractor facilities will only be required for their staff services provided under the T&M CLINS in the solicitation.

20.  In Amendment 2, paragraph 1.3.2.1, a requirement for Unit Instructors is to be proficient in using Microsoft WORD, Outlook, EXCEL, PowerPoint and computer graphics programs.  Is that requirement intended to be for course support staff rather than Unit Instructor?  If so, why do you feel that all of these qualifications are required at that level?

Answer: Yes, all unit instructors must be proficient in using the software listed in paragraph 1.3.2.1 of the Performance Work Statement as listed in Amendment 2 to the combined synopsis/solicitation.

21.  Are the resumes included in the 50-page limit? 

Answer: Yes.

22.  Are the Representations and Certifications included in the 50-page limit? 

Answer:  No.  In addition, the Offeror’s Representations and Certifications can be listed on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website and the Offeror’s proposal need only reference that fact.

23.  The description of work states: “The total not to exceed ceiling, expressed in labor hours, for the T&M CLINS is 3,000 labor hours for the base period; 2400 labor hours for Option Period One; etc.” Is this a total for CLINS 00002, 00003, and 0004 or is it for each CLIN?

Answer: Please see the answer to question number 15.

24. Where will the courses be held in order to determine travel and per diem costs? 

Answer:  Please see the responses to previous questions relating to travel.

25. Will the place of performance (Washington, D.C) be used for programmatic review meetings exclusively? 

Answer:  Please see the response to question number 6.

26. Will curriculum development and facilitator-coaches be located in other places (such as USCG Base Yorktown)? 

Answer: Yes, curriculum development personnel and facilitator-coaches are located at TRACEN Yorktown Virginia, but are also located at other Coast Guard facilities.

27. What is the anticipated award date? 
Answer: It is the Coast Guard’s intention to award this contract upon the completion of the procurement process and it’s anticipated that this will be no later than the end of September 2006.

28.  Will the government provide the training facility? If yes, where is the projected training site, if known?

Answer: Please see the response to question 12.

29.  What is the anticipated start date of this training?

Answer:  Please see the response to question 27.

30.  What is the anticipated time between a task order for a training course and the implementation date of the training?

Answer:  There will be at least a 30 day period between the award of each task order and the commencement of training under that task order, although this time period is anticipated to be shorter for the first task order to be issued under the contract.  A draft yearly Training Schedule will be provided at the contract Kick Off meeting for Contractor planning purposes.

31.  What is the length in days of each of the courses?

Answer:  The course lengths are found in the Performance Work Statement contained in Solicitation Amendment 2 posted to the FedBizOpps website on June 29, 2006. 

32.  Do student materials have to be provided for each course?  If so, is the contractor responsible for duplicating course materials?

Answer:  Please see the response to question number 3.  The Contractor shall provide all materials necessary to provide these services.

33.  Are any of these courses live simulations requiring coordination of multiple “actors” and sites?

Answer:  All of the courses require live exercise simulations, except the ICS-408 course, most requiring at least two people.  Also, please see the response to question number 13.

34.  How many students can we expect in each class?

Answer:  The number of students in each course is found in the Performance Work Statement contained in Solicitation Amendment 2 posted to the FedBizOpps website on June 29, 2006. 

35.  Can you provide the locations for the course deliveries so we can estimate T&L? 

Answer:  Please see the response to previous questions and answers herein.

36.  We are an SBA 8(a) small business, but we plan to team with a large consulting firm to provide depth of staff.  While personnel on our staff have facilitated courses at DIA and NMITC, and have developed course materials for USCG, ISSI does not have past performance references in the training domain.  Instructor-led and e-learning are strategic business targets for ISSI.  We have a partner who does have those references and was chosen specifically to meet USCG training needs.  We believe the combined team provides depth of talent and will exceed USCG requirements.  Can we use the partner’s team past performance for USCG training and ISSI past performance for program and project management and references? 

Answer:  You may propose an approach that incorporates subcontractors and teaming arrangements.  Should you do so, you are encouraged to provide relevant past performance for those efforts which are significant to the overall proposed approach for consideration.

QUESTIONS/ANSWERS FOR HSFEEM-06-Q-0041

QUESTION #1:  From the description of your requirements and expectations of quotations, it sounds like you are looking for an existing off-the-shelf solution.  Or, could offerors propose a customized solution to meet the Government’s need?

ANSWER #1:  The Government feels that there are existing web-hosted platforms which will satisfy its requirements, based on its research of the market.  It is certainly possible that an offeror will not have an existing product that would satisfy Government requirements as stated, and therefore the offeror would need to accomplish minor modifications in order to meet the Government’s requirements.  The Government is not interested in purchasing software for use on a Government web site.  The Government is interested in purchasing access to a non-government-hosted web site whereby the stated features as specified within the solicitation would be available for use within a secured web environment.  Commercial items are those that are readily available for sale and use to the general public; however, with minor modifications/alterations they can be adapted for a Government purpose (see Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 2.101 for further definition of a commercial item).

QUESTION #2:  It is stated that the USFA has previously used proprietary or copyrighted assessment instruments.  Will these or similar instruments be required to work within the contractor’s platform?  If so, please identify those instruments or identify any compliance standards (e.g., AICC, SCORM) of the instruments.

ANSWER #2:  The instruments that have been used previously will not be used in the contractor’s platform.  A similar instrument(s) that the Government will own will be used; however, since the new instrument(s) is in the process of being designed and developed, offerors cannot access the instrument.  The offeror should closely review the compliance standards (AICC or SCORM) stated by the Government in the Statement of Work.

QUESTION #3:  What is the anticipated project start date?

ANSWER #3:  The effective date of the award of a purchase order, approximately 3-4 weeks from today.

QUESTION #4:  Please advise if this solicitation will require a specific language such as Java JSP, C+.  Also, if a specific program must be used such as Linux or Oracle.

ANSWER #4:  The solicitation does not require a specific language.  Since the instrumentation will be contained/published within the offeror’s hosted website, the language in which the program is authored must be compatible with the same site.

QUESTION #5:  Is there an existing incumbent contractor?

ANSWER #5:  No.

<DESC>Description:  This a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Background:  The Library of Congress, Congressional Research Services (CRS), 
to ensure that staff have the training and tools they need to provide research, analysis, and information support to the members and committees of the House and Senate, seek a contractor to provide assistances in developing and delivering:  (1) on-site, customized Mentor/Mentee training as part of the implementation of the Mentor Program in CRS; (2) customized orientation to the CRS Mentor Program for the CRS Research Policy Council (RPC); and (3) a Mentor/Mentee Handbook.  The contractor will provide on site training to approximately sixty (60) CRS staff members to be trained as part of the Mentor/Mentee training program.   

Award will be based on a best value determination, price and other factors considered.  Other factors for award include (1) Technical Approach (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Pass Performance.  Evaluation Factors (in order of importance):  (1) Demonstrated the understanding of and responsiveness to the specific requirements identified; (2) Demonstrated recent experience in mentor program training, including project staffing, experience, and skills and qualifications of the proposed key personnel; and (3) Demonstrated relevant project experience with training in a congressional, congressional support, or government agency environment or similar high –level audience.

The offeror shall provide resumes for the key personnel of the firm involved with the contract from its inception to completion.  The offeror shall submit the names, address, and phone numbers of three (3) references.  The offer must have performed/completed the work with each of the references within the last three years and the contact information must be current.  

Preparation of Offers:  Responses to this solicitation must be submitted in two separate volumes.  Volume 1: Technical Proposal and Volume II: Price Proposal.  All offerors are required to submit a price for the initial year and each of the four options years.  The price must include a “per session” rate based upon an estimated 3 sessions per year. Proposals must be submitted electronically (via email to adoz@loc.gov) and in hard copy.  Hard copy proposals must be submitted with one original and two copies.  Proposals are due on or before July 24, 2006.  Proposal received after the due date will not be accepted.  
Statement of Work:
A.  BACKGROUND
The Congressional Research Service (CRS), a service unit of the Library of Congress, works exclusively for the United States Congress, providing research, analysis, and information support to the members and committees of the House and Senate.  These services are provided by a highly educated staff of policy analysts, information specialists, and other professionals.

The mission of CRS is to provide to the Congress, throughout the legislative process, comprehensive and reliable legislative research, analysis and information services that are timely, non-partisan, and confidential, thereby contributing to an informed national legislature.  The vision of CRS is that the Congress turns to CRS first when it is in need of legislative, research analysis or information in addressing the issues of the Nation.  As an organization, CRS has adopted the values of client service, uncompromising integrity, total quality, mutual respect, and diversity.

As part of its ongoing efforts to ensure that CRS provides the highest possible quality of support to the Congress, CRS carries out a comprehensive training program to improve the knowledge base of CRS staff in a number of areas, including best practices in mentoring.

In 1999, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) Director established a Working Group to focus on mentoring activities that would further the Service’s goal to enhance diversity and to assist with succession planning.  This Working Group recommended the establishment of a formal CRS Mentor Program that would provide guidance to new employees by more experienced employees and facilitate support from management and staff to carry out that instruction.

As a result of their work, the Working Group recommended that the CRS Mentor Program develop a high quality, diverse workforce that values information exchange and encourages a creative and productive work environment.  The principle vehicle for this program commitment was that new employees would work closely with more experienced employees who would serve as role models to help new hires work effectively, make personal adjustments, and move forward in his/her careers.

B.  SCOPE OF WORK
To ensure that CRS staff have the training and tools they need to provide the highest quality analytical work for the Congress, CRS requires assistance in developing and delivering: (1)  on-site, customized Mentor/Mentee training as part of the implementation of the Mentor Program in CRS; (2) customized orientation to the CRS Mentor Program for the CRS Research Policy Council (RPC); and (3) a Mentor/Mentee Handbook based upon the customized mentor/mentee training program -- to be used as a training guide for new employees hired after the initial training program has been delivered.

C.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
The target audience for the Mentor/Mentee training will be the mentees –  newly hired CRS staff, including but not limited to analysts, attorneys, information specialists, and administrative personnel;  and mentors – experienced CRS employees.  The target audience for the customized orientation to the Mentor Program will be the Resource Policy Council (RPC) – senior level managers.
The learning objectives for the Mentor/Mentee training that must be met include, but are not limited to:
•Understanding the goals of the mentoring relationship in the context of CRS’s Mentor Program;
•Understanding mentoring, i.e., what it is and isn’t;
•Understanding the roles/responsibilities and expectations of mentors and mentees;
•Understanding the steps in establishing a meaningful mentoring relationship in initiating the mentoring process;

ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-09.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is being competed on an unrestricted basis.  Therefore, all responsible parties may submit a quote.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Active Radioactive Materials (RAM) Waste Monitor.

***The contract line items (CLINS) for this procurement are:

 CLIN 0001: Active Radioactive Materials (RAM) Waste Monitor for measurement and clearance of potentially contaminated items, Quantity:  1, Unit:  Each, which shall meet or exceed the following required specifications: 

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR CLIN 0001:
The monitor shall have a minimum capacity volume of 52 x 52 x 52 cm for clearing waste generated in the laboratory. The laboratory uses a variety of radiation sources, emission types, and energies including low energy X-ray (about 40 [plus or minus 10] keV), high energy gamma (1.3 MeV) and moderate to high energy betas (50 keV to 1.7 MeV).  

Functional Requirements

The system shall consist of a minimum of 4 large area detectors to measure gamma emitting radionuclides, low energy X-ray, and high energy beta particles (presumably plastic scintilators). All of the detectors shall be arranged to maximize coverage of the interior surface of the chamber creating an approximately 4 pi detection geometry (at a minimum top, bottom, and sides). External background signal shall be suppressed by surrounding the detectors and counting chamber (top, bottom, sides, and door/s) with an amount of lead to shield the detectors from a typical background of about 50uR/hr. Additionally the system shall be able to actively monitor the background when not in use and apply this background subtraction to determine net counting results. All computer displays, electronics, controls, indicator lights, keyboard/pad, shall allow the user to control and monitor the system. Count cycles shall be initiated either by simply closing the door of by a simple push button. Monitor results with the date, time background, net count, and result of check “OK” or “Alarm” shall be displayed. The user interface shall allow the users to set detection, count cycle, and alarm parameters, perform QA and calibration functions, and select output formats. The unit shall include all ancillary items needed for full and complete turnkey operations including but not limited to: power cords, surge protectors, input key boards, output printers and cables, video displays, gas regulators (if required), transport carts, shielding, and detectors cables and tubing.

Detector Characteristics

The system shall utilize detectors capable of detecting contamination from high energy beta-, gamma-, and X-ray emitting radiation sources including: Sr-89/90, Y-90, Tc-99/m, Mo-99, Cs-137, P-32, Am-241, Pu-239, and U-238. The detectors shall employ plastic scintillators.  Solid state detectors or sealed proportional tubes would be an acceptable alternative, as long as they meet the same or better performance, detection, and background suppression specifications of detectors employing plastic scintillators with photomultiplier tubes.   

The system shall be capable of detecting and alarming for activities above 2 nanocuries with a counting time not greater than 20 minutes while operating in a moderate to low external background field up to 0.2 mR/hr.

The system shall be capable of operating in the temperature range of 5 degrees C to 40 degrees C (41 degrees F to 104 degrees F). The system shall meet performance requirements without fluctuation or adjustment in operating parameters for normal variations in laboratory environmental conditions with room temperature 15-32 degrees Celsius, and relative humidity 20-70 percent.

The system shall operate on standard AC power at 115 to 125 volts at 60 Hz. 

The instrument shall be self contained. The system (including computer display and output device) shall be capable of being moved by one individual, without disassembly or technical support from the manufacturer.

The internal lining and detectors shall be capable of being removed, cleaned, or replaced by NIST personnel without use of specialized tools unless such tools are provided with CLIN 0001. Detectors shall be replaceable or repairable by NIST personnel.

Count cycle times shall be variable and selectable by NIST staff ranging from 1 minute up to 15 minutes. (Alternatively count times may be adjusted automatically based on alarm set point – Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) and background algorithms). 

Monitor results shall report date, time, “Alarm”, “OK”, “Clear”, background value, and support units such as gross and net counts and/or count rates, measured activities in disintegration rates as reported in disintegrations per minute and/or SI units, and minimal detectable activities in the same units as measured activities (dps, Bq, or nanocuries). The “Alarm” and threshold shall be based on user-specified levels.

All system documentation, operation maintenance, repair manuals, and required software along with backup disks of the programs for reinstallation shall be included. A listing of all proprietary items, system requirements, current costs, and replacement lead times shall be included with the delivered documentation.


***Delivery shall be completed not later than 90 days after order acceptance.  CLIN 0001 SHALL BE OFFERED ON AN FOB DESTINATION BASIS ONLY.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT CONSIDER OFFERS ON ANY OTHER BASIS.  The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ***

CLIN 0002:  Within thirty (30) days of delivery, the Contractor shall provide a technical representative on site at NIST for setup and initial calibration of the unit. At that time, the technical representative shall provide NIST staff with training (a minimum 4 hours) on the setup, operations, QA, and maintenance of the unit. The technical representative shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the NIST COTR that the unit satisfies all aspects of the specifications in the purchase order.  If the Contractor is required to install the system, the cost of that service shall be included in CLIN 0002.***

*** The Government will not accept CLIN 0001 until after CLIN 0002 is completed and only if CLIN 0001 meets or exceeds all minimum specifications.***

<DESC>This requirement has been cancelled.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) discovered that another Federal Agency has the ability to fulfill DVA's need. DVA intends to set up an agreement with Federal Occupational Health Services under the Dept of Health &amp; Human ServicesEye Street (Tech world): 93 and 2 for EAP      The top visits are:  Blood pressure, allergy shots, upper respiratory, sinus  Are the senior examinations noted in the AD HOC CLIN above and beyond the GS-14 examinations? Answer:  No  For mass immunizations such as Flu, will the vaccine be acquired by the Government or the Contractor?   Answer:  For the regular flu shots, i.e. 2004 = 1600, 2003 = 1200, 2002 = 1000 &amp; for 2005 there was a flu shot shortage), the contractor will cover the cost; but for extreme cases where the number exceeds the average, Government will cover the cost under the AD HOC Clin What is the expectation for EAP services:  face-to-face counseling sessions  Answer: 5-6 sessions per issue Approximately 10 employees per month There is a backup  1-800 telephone number Are there DVA established/required protocols, e.g. treadmills, hearing examinations?  If so what are they?  Answer:  No except for food service handlers, motor vehicle operators, and drug testing Are there any industrial operations?  If so how many employees are engaged in these type operations? Answer:  no What is the medical records media--all paper or electronic?  If electronic, is it government owned or contractor owned software?  Answer:  The medical records are hard copies How is biohazardous waste currently handled? Answer:  The incumbent has an arrangement with a biohazard company to collect the waste/hazardous materials Is the vendor required to pay for X-rays  or will this be considered a pass through expense within the AD HOC Clin?  If this is not a pass through expense, approximately how many x-rays are taken in any given year?-  Answer:  NO, X-RAYS are not required Are lab tests required as part of the physical examination?  If so, which lab tests are required and how many per year Answer:  	a.  Lab tests are required    b. Complete chemistries, chem. 20, CBC (complete blood count with differential), urinalysis, glaucoma screening and ekg,   c.  On an average 20 test sets per month. Will these be considered a pass through expense and billed on the AD HOC Clin?  Answer:  No, it is part of the standard service There was no equipment list provided.  Was this inadvertently not supplied or is the vendor to consider equipment purchases to be a pass through expense to be billed under the ad hoc clin? Answer:  Equipment is provided in support of required services (the listing is attached). The Wage Determination Labor Category for the Lead Nurse provides for a wage that is higher than the prevailing market wages for the associated responsibilities?  It has been our experience that Lead Nurse salaries in the DC Metro area are several dollars per hour less.  Will this be reconsidered or shall we quote the wage minimum per the Service Contract Act? Answer: The DOL wage determination presents the mandatory minimums.  Is the vendor to assume that all fitness center costs, except those mentioned under Contractor Furnished Property/Materials, are to be paid for with membership dues?  In other words, when the vendor collects the dues, do they keep the dues to fund the fitness center costs?  What is to be done with funds that are in excess of costs plus reasonable fees (if there are any excess funds)? Answer:  The DVA provides the facility, electricity, equipment and water.  The vendor is to manage the facility and any excess in fees (minus salaries and supplies) would be considered profit for the vendor Is the vendor to set up the drug  testing program?   Answer:  No, it is already established. Are they to absorb the costs or is this to be billed under the ad hoc clin?  If not, approximately how many drug tests are provided in any given year? Answer:  The vendor is only providing the supervised extraction and transportation of the sample.  And there are approximately 2-4 employees a month Is the vendor required to sign and include the "Business Associate Agreement" as provided in the RFP?  Answer:  It must be signed prior to award.  It is not necessary to include it in the proposal as the vendor may require adjustments Is FAR 52.212-3 the only FAR that needs to be completed and submitted with our proposal (or completed on line at orca.bpn.org)? Answer:  It is the representations and certifications for the award.   Does the Scope of Work require that the Contractor manages one fitness center located at 810 Vermont Avenue, NW, (VA Central Office) and employees/contractors from the three other locations use the one workout facility? Thus, providing fitness services for the roughly 4500 employees? Answer:  Historically, it is only 350 -450 members.  It may be possible to greatly improve the membership but not to the scope of the total population - the facility is too small.   Each of the four locations would have an on-site wellness center in which the Contractor would also manage? Answer:  Yes, there is a wellness center (clinic) in each of the locations Is the Past Performance section now the following? The offeror shall identify three (3) contracts /task orders with the Federal Government and/or commercial customers that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance.  Recent is defined as within the last three (3) years. Relevant is defined as work similar in type, complexity and , magnitude of the work described in this Statement of Objectives.  The Offeror is requested to provide the Government a telephone number, email address, and fax number of the three contractors where the Government can send out the Past Performance Questionnaire.  This information should be submitted with the proposals. Answer:  Yes, it is now the requirement for submission. List of Site Visit Attendees Whole Health Management Inc.
