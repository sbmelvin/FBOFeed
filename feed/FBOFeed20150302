Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
23.	UID:  If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

R15PS00576 PROVO AREA OFFICE JETTER TRAILER

PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE:   

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region has a requirement for a Jetter System delivered to the Provo Area Office.

Bureau of Reclamation owned facilities often require closed-circuit television (CCTV) inspection of areas where human access is unattainable. The most common (and most extreme) of these are toe drain piping systems, which are typically installed in earthfill dams to collect seepage at the downstream toe. The toe drain pipes were made from a variety of materials including concrete, clay tile, corrugated metal, PVC, and corrugated and smooth HDPE, in sizes ranging from 6 to 30 inches in diameter. 

Past CCTV inspections of these systems have revealed stormdrain like conditions with roots, vegetation, sediment, sand, gravel, stones, and other debris present in both wet and dry conditions on the invert of the pipes. In order to properly assess these features, Reclamation must clean the debris from within the toe drain pipes using a cold water jetter system. As such, Reclamation is procuring a jetter system pursuant to the requirements defined under the subject solicitation. The jetter system should deliver 25 gpm at 4,000 psi, and be equipped with a hydraulically driven hose reel. The trailer water tanks should be capable of hauling at least 650 gallons of water.

COMPETITION:  

Solicitation R15PS00576 will be posted via FedBid as a small business set aside. A firm-fixed price supply purchase order is anticipated. 

NAICS AND SIZE STANDARD:  

The NAICS code for this project is 423830 with a small business size standard of 100 employees. 

RESPONSES:  

Any responses received under this special notice will be used for market research purposes only. Please respond no later than Thursday March 5, 2015. All interested parties should submit a quote via fedbid.com.

<DESC>Item Description: NSN 2920-01-611-1041- Exciter, Ignition, Manifold, bought in accordance with L-3 Communications Corporation (02978) part number E8CR128-023. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. The required quantity is 128 units with a 100% option to be shipped to (W25G1U) New Cumberland, PA 17070-5002. FOB origin and inspection/acceptance at destination is required. This solicitation will be available on the internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 03/18/15. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery and past performance. The required delivery is 365 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. All interested parties may submit an offer.<br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposal shall not be transmitted directly to the contracting officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at: ContractorProposalDLALandandMaritime@dla.mil. E-mailed proposals cannot exceed 15MB.<br />

<DESC>Description: NSN 2540-01-493-4548- COVER, VENTILATORY being bought in accordance with M.M. REIF LTD. DBA 1KNH1 P/N VC-3615RG. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. The required quantity is 254 each to be shipped within 120 days. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp on or about the anticipated issue date of 03/16/2015. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in US dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307

Diamond-Blackfan Anemia is one of the specific diseases that this larger rubric encompasses. CGB has a need to obtain results of the red cell adenosine deaminase (ADA) test and the profile of red cell purine and pyrimidine metabolism enzymes to provide confirmatory support of the diagnosis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia. The samples will be derived from individuals who are members of families in which there is a clinical basis to suspect the diagnosis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia. This particular study is part of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, intramural research program within DCEG's Human Genetics Program which is focused upon elucidation of the entire spectrum of scientific and clinical issues related to familial and hereditary forms of cancer. CGB's study is ongoing, and the performance characteristics and quality of the needed services are required for maintaining the integrity of on-going studies. A change would be disruptive to the ability to analyze the study's cumulative results. This study is an integral part of the NCI protocol 02-C-0052.</p>
<p>Contractor shall perform the following tasks:<br />&bull; The cells derived from coded samples of peripheral blood in EDTA will be analyzed for red cell adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels and the levels of red cell purine and pyrimidine <br />metabolism enzymes.</p>
<p>&bull; Red cell adenosine deaminase (ADA) test and the profile of red cell purine and pyrimidine metabolism enzymes on each sample in a CLIA-certified laboratory.</p>
<p>&bull; A written report for blood samples shall be returned to the CGB Investigator within twenty-one (21) working days from specimen receipt, except in the case of unusual problems requiring additional investigation. These exceptions must be negotiated directly via telephone discussion with the CGB Investigator. The report will include the levels of the red cell adenosine deaminase and of the other enzymes which were measured. These levels shall be reported as international units of enzyme per gram of hemoglobin. This information shall be reported for each patient specimen submitted and for the control samples that are run in the same assay concurrently.</p>
<p>&bull; In lieu of meetings, the contractor will provide an updated cumulative excel file at 6 month intervals, containing the data discussed above under requirements, for all samples received prior to that date. The dates will be January and July, for the preceding 6 months to be added to the file.</p>
<p>This laboratory testing service is provided by the Anatomic Pathology &amp; Clinical Laboratories at Stanford Health Care. The proposed source is the only laboratory that can perform the required studies. They have been analyzing red cell enzymes for more than 30 years and are the "gold standard" for CGB's own cohort study. This laboratory has extensive experience with the documentation of elevated red cell adenosine deaminase (ADA) in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), and distinction of DBA from all other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. Most laboratories that measure ADA do so in the context of decreased levels in some immune disorders, the opposite of the direction CGB find in its patients. The assay is both sensitive and specific, and is critical for proper classification of our patients, and is imperative for the integrity and continuity of the on-going study.</p>

<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E140, Rockville, MD 20850, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis services to image previously reviewed and stained Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) slides using second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy and to quantify patterns of collagen alignment in these images in BREAST Stamp Project participants (n=154) from University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1111 Highland Ave Room 4533, Madison, WI 53705.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15.0 Million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>Project background:</p>
<p>Women with the highest levels of mammographic breast density are at 4-fold increased risk of breast cancer, compared with women who have the lowest levels of density. Mammographic density reflects the amount of fibroglandular tissue in the breast, which is composed of fibroblasts, epithelial cells and connective tissue. Increased collagen content is characteristic of dense tissue. Collagen remodeling has been linked to development and progression of breast cancer in animal models, and among women, specific tumor associated collagen signatures (TACS) have been linked to breast cancer and disease specific survival. However, links between mammographic density, TACS and pathologic diagnosis (benign vs. cancer) have not been explored in epidemiologic studies.</p>
<p>Multiphoton second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a high-resolution microscopy technology that can image collagen fibers in live or fixed breast tissues, without special staining or labelling. These images can then be visually assessed for collagen (i.e., TACS) signatures and also assessed using a computer-assisted collagen curvelet transform fiber extraction algorithm (CT-FIRE), which enables automated quantitative analysis of collagen fiber length, angle and waviness from the SHG images of breast tissues.</p>
<p>Using these methods, this study will test whether collagen fiber signatures or patterns of collagen features are related to mammographic breast density and pathologic diagnosis within NCI's Breast Radiology Evaluation And Study of Tissues (BREAST) Stamp Project. The BREAST Stamp Project was designed to investigate molecular mechanisms that mediate associations of elevated mammographic density with cancer by studying volumetric density and corresponding clinical biopsy tissues from women undergoing diagnostic image-guided breast biopsies. The novel mammographic density measures collected in this project include quantitative measurements of density in small regions surrounding suspicious targets prior to clinical biopsy. This study design will allow the association of quantitative measurements of volumetric density at the biopsy site with collagen signatures and pathologic diagnosis to be determined, to test the hypothesis that stromal alterations are related to breast cancer and high density.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements are:</p>
<p>Image multiple sections of previously reviewed and stained Hematoxylin and Eosin H&amp;E slides using the state-of-the-art SHG microscopy tool for benign (n=77) and malignant (n=77) breast tissues from participants in the BREAST Stamp Project.</p>
<p>Following imaging, assess collagen architectural patterns using visual assessment for each study participant and assign each participant with a &lsquo;Tumor Associated Collagen Signature' Score.</p>
<p>Following imaging, apply the algorithm CT-FIRE to quantitatively assess collagen architectural patterns, including collagen fiber length, angle and waviness.</p>
<p>Implement quality control (QC) measures for image processing and analysis and for collagen assessment analysis and to provide QC results.</p>
<p>Provide results including representative images, collagen TACS signatures, collagen fiber length, angle and waviness for these breast tissues from each study participant.</p>
<p>To return H&amp;E analyzed slides to NCI upon completion of analysis.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities<br />The NCI COR shall provide the Contractor with microscopic slides containing breast biopsy tissues previously stained for H&amp;E from 154 BREAST Stamp Projects participants. The NCI COTR shall review the data following completion of the task.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables<br />Deliverables: The contractor will provide receipt of all the slides that are shipped. The Contractor will provide electronic data and analytic results outlined above. Electronic data may be submitted using Excel spreadsheets.</p>
<p>The Contractor will return the H&amp;E stained breast biopsy tissue slides to NCI following completion of the analysis in light protected boxes at room temperature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 1 PM EST, on March 17, 2015.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Becton, Dickinson and Company, One Becton Drive, Franklin Lakes, NJ, 07417-1880 to provide antibodies for H5N1 study.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The mission of the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) is to perform robust scientific and clinical research leading to a better understanding of biology and clinical pathology. To attain this goal, we have built a strong basic science foundation and coupled it closely with innovative technology development and outstanding clinical research both at the NIH Clinical Center and in partnership with local hospitals.</p>
<p>The purview of our research is broad, encompassing investigations into the basic principles of molecular, cellular, and organ-level biology and their relationship to disease. Some current areas of fundamental interest include single molecule structure; protein assembly; molecular and cell biology; cell signaling and motility; membrane trafficking; physiology; systems biology; engineering and technology development. Insights into disease mechanisms derived from basic studies form the basis for translational research into new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p>DIR investigators also conduct concept-based clinical studies in the areas of interventional and surgical cardiology; pulmonary medicine; sickle cell anemia; bone marrow transplant; and hematologic disorders.<br />The mission of the trans-NIH CHI is cooperative research based on advanced technologies in order to efficiently translate enhanced understanding of immune function and pathophysiology to the clinic. The Center is based on cooperative research, technologically driven with the goal of understanding human immunology, and addressing pathophysiologically-related human diseases. This initiative is translational, but this overused term is defined here as both directly resulting in improved therapy of immune-mediated diseases and deriving important and often unique biologic information from the study of ill human beings.</p>
<p>The research performed in the Flow Cytometry section of the Center for Human Immunology (CHI) involves characterizing the antigen expression of white blood cells using fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies. These reagents are mixed together as staining cocktails. Optimization of these cocktails, including titering each of the reagents, is complex and labor-intensive.</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Branch, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking capabilities packages of potential sources, including Small Business (SB), HUBZone, Economically-Disadvantaged Woman-Owned (EDWO) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVO) small business concerns. This sources sought is for planning purposes only. The scope of this project includes all work associated with removing existing dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) units, make-up air units, constant volume air-handling units, exhaust fans, and transfer fans, and replacing them with new variable-air-volume (VAV) air-handling units, VAV terminal boxes, exhaust fans, and transfer fans. The work includes associated modifications to ductwork, piping, ancillary equipment, and providing new Direct Digital Controls (DDC). Due to the increased sizes of the new air-handling units, rework of the mechanical rooms will need to take place to get all of the larger equipment, ductwork and piping to fit. New VAV terminal boxes on the DOAS systems will be cooling only, and all other VAV terminal boxes will have hot water reheat coils with new hot water piping installed to them. The work also includes the extension of existing wet pipe sprinkler systems to provide protection for areas (rooms) currently not protected, and the installation of emergency egress lighting and audio/visual fire alarm devices in identified areas.
<p>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: <br />The majority of the project is required to meet ICD 705 security standards and therefore attention to security details and coordination with the Government will be required for inspection and certification of the spaces. A 72 hour notice is required for facility access and escorts are required for all work to be accomplished. The scope of this project requires the Contractor to adhere to strict, well-coordinated schedules, and a need to maintain meticulously kept work sites, material storage, and staging areas. The Contractor is required to incorporate efficient delivery routes throughout the complete project site to prevent impacts to occupants and project delays. The facility will remain occupied while work commences and the Contractor must work to minimize impact to normal operations of the facility. The Contractor is required to develop a schedule for his work that includes length of time that each space will need to be occupied. The Contractor will be required to provide the Contracting Officer with weekly briefings. These briefings shall track progress and identify all spaces that will be impacted by his work three weeks before the work in these spaces is planned for execution.</p>

McMaster, Director of the Army Capabilities and Integration Center, will discuss the Army of 2025 and Beyond. Force 2025 will require land power concepts and capabilities for the Joint Force as integrated and innovative solutions within Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF).<br /><br />Their speeches will be followed by two senior leader panels discussing:</p>
<p>&bull; The complex operational environment, Force 2025 and Beyond, and desired realistic training.</p>
<p>&bull; The evolution of training toward one live-synthetic training environment and the Army's modernization challenges in enabling realistic training today.</p>
<p>These topics were discussed at similar engagements at an Association of the United States Army convention and the Inter-Service/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference.</p>
<p>For additional information and to register for the CAC Industry Forum please go to: http://usacac.army.mil/node/565 or call 913-684-8316. The registration deadline is Jan. 23, 2015. There is no registration fee.</p>
<p>CAC, Fort Leavenworth, is a major subordinate headquarters of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. It has often been referred to as the "Intellectual Center of the Army."</p>

<DESC>This Partnership Opportunity Document (POD) is in association with an upcoming NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for an Earth Venture Mission (EV-M) due to be released in the summer of 2015.	NASAs GSFC is seeking a partner for the development of a Command and Data Handling (C&DH) unit with radar transmission waveform and timing signal generation capability. This subsystem is a key element of a remote sensing radar for a potential EV-M proposal, which is designed to meet the science goals of the NASA EV-M Program, as currently understood.  <p> NASAs GSFC mission teams will be submitting proposals to the EV-M AO currently scheduled for release by June 30, 2015.  The mission AO will be a single step competitive process. The selected mission will proceed directly into Phase A.  While the AO schedule cannot be fully specified at this time, the following is estimated on the basis of recent AOs and related missions: <p> AO release				June 30, 2015 Proposals due				September 30, 2015 (TBR) Selection				March/April 2016 Launch				TBD <p> This POD is issued to select a teaming partner to help prepare the NASAs GSFC EV-M candidate mission concept for proposal submittal and to provide a suitable radar C&DH and waveform/timing generation unit development should the mission be selected for flight. <p> There will be no exchange of funds between the teaming partners for the portion of this partnership opportunity dealing with the preparation of the initial submission of a proposal to the EV-M AO. Full funding will be available for subsequent phases should the mission be competitively selected for those additional phases. <p> 1.0 Mission Overview <p> The objective of the potential NASAs GSFC EV-M proposal is to develop a low cost dual-frequency profiling radar for measurements of cloud and precipitation from space. Cost is a critical factor in all EV-2 mission concepts. The win-ability of this proposal highly depends on the science return, instrument technology readiness and mission cost. <p> 1.1 Desired of A C&DH and Waveform/Timing Generation Unit <p> NASAs GSFC is interested in finding a partner to provide a Command and Data Handling unit with a radar waveform and timing generation module for a dual-frequency (Ka-band, 35.5 GHz, and W-band 94.0 GHz) remote sensing radar. All interested parties are required to respond to this POD in accordance with Section 4.0 below. <p> 2.0  C&DH and Waveform/Timing Generation Unit 2.1 Initial Proposal Support <p> SOW:  It is expected that the selected respondent will provide support using their own resources to help develop and prepare the full EV-M mission proposal in response to the NASA AO associated with the C&DH unit (with waveform and timing generation capability) design, fabrication, test and integration with the other radar electronics.

<DESC>1 Introduction<br />This request for information (RFI) is not a solicitation for a contract or grant award. This RFI notice is for information and planning purposes only, is not a request for proposal and is issued in accordance with FAR Provision 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (OCT 1997) provided at: http://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/52_215.html#wp1144503. No solicitation document exists at this time. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or services to issue a solicitation. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this request for information, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.
<p>2 Background <br />The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Integrated Dissemination Program (IDP) office is requesting information from industry and other organizations (e.g., non-profits, research laboratories, and universities) to determine whether capability and interest exists for establishing partnerships with NOAA for the purpose of re-architecting the NWS Telecommunications Gateway (NWSTG) under the newly-formed Integrated Dissemination Program (IDP).</p>
<p>A re-architected NWSTG capability will ensure a modern, scalable, extensible, and reliable dissemination and infrastructure services are constructed using current best practices. The NWSTG is the Nation's hub, operating on a 24x7 cycle for the collection and distribution of an extensive range of weather data and products (surface observations, models, radar imagery, satellite imagery, buoy data, watches and warnings, and forecasts). Additionally, customer's worldwide use of data distributed by NWSTG affects a wide range of economic and emergency management decisions. NWSTG is also the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Region IV Global Information System Center (GISC).</p>
<p>The NWSTG provides national and global near real-time data exchange services using automated communication resources, transmitting a wide variety of environmental data types. The NWSTG is operated twenty four hours a day to acquire process observations, construct messages, and disseminate messages and files of observations, model analysis, and forecast products. The time-perishable products are disseminated cyclically according to fixed schedules. The NWSTG is committed to maintaining a timely and reliable transmission of products at the highest level.</p>
<p>2.1 System Background<br />The mission of the NWSTG is to provide timely, efficient, and effective dissemination of all-weather products to all customers for the continuous protection of life, limb, and property. The NWSTG is a central collection center and communications switching system (via broadcast and/or web services) for millions of hydro-meteorological observations and products each day for the following user communities:<br />&bull; Internal NOAA (e.g. Weather Forecast Offices)<br />&bull; Federal Agencies (DoD, DHS, DoT, DoA)<br />&bull; International Community (e.g. World Meteorological Organization (WMO))<br />&bull; WMO Global Information System Centre (GISC) Washington <br />&bull; WMO Regional Telecommunication Hub - Washington<br />&bull; Commercial Operational Partners (e.g. WeatherBug, AccuWeather)<br />&bull; Academia (e.g. University of Oklahoma, Penn State)<br />&bull; Public users</p>
<p>The NWSTG has been identified as an essential government resource in Presidential Decision Directive 67 - Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations. The NWSTG receives / disseminates over 3.2 million watches, warnings, products, and observations per year, and 1,880 radar products every 5 minutes. The daily bandwidth averages 6+ terabytes for all weather products with an average latency of 55 seconds.</p>
<p>3 Purpose of this Request for Information (RFI)<br />NOAA NWS is looking to replace the existing NWSTG message switching system, which is the core component of NWSTG. This RFI is intended to inform NOAA on the current status of industry sources, business practices, technical capacity, and operational capability of vendors providing message switching systems product/solution. NOAA is providing all industry stakeholders an opportunity to comment and respond to this RFI.</p>
<p>The submission shall reflect the vendor's product/solution and approach to address product/solution capabilities, fit to meet the requirements and replace the existing message switching system while meeting all requirements for security, system scalability and efficiency, reliability and availability, data messaging frameworks, and an overall strategy for implementing the system. The response shall include as much details as possible for the government to understand the available products/solution, its capabilities in managing weather related data as and where applicable, and how the product will be able to replace the existing gateway switching system.</p>
<p>4 Scope<br />NWS is looking at re-architecting the current NWSTG Message Switching System by replacing the current system with a more manageable, efficient, scalable and robust system. The NWS is looking for companies to respond to this RFI to inform us about their capabilities, experience, and knowledge in providing such enterprise grade switching system services for weather data. The enterprise grade switching system should be able to fully replace the current system capabilities and provide added scalability and efficiency without disrupting the overall operations.</p>
<p>4.1 Current Telecommunication Gateway Switching System overview:<br />The Telecommunication Gateway Message Switching system is considered to be the core of the NWSTG operation. There are three primary components of the NWSTG; 1) Data Ingest, 2) Message Switching and, 3) Data Dissemination. It is at the center of a 24x7, highly critical NWS operations service which ultimately factors in the savings of life, limb, and property through the timely and accurate delivery of weather warnings and watches to the general public. It is imperative we are running 24x7x365 days, with the expectation of availability being at 100%.</p>
<p>4.1.1 Data Ingest:<br />Currently, the NWS collects data from a wide range of weather observing systems which includes surface weather, radar weather, oceanic weather, etc., The NWS also has a wide range of partners, both nationally and internationally who provide and collect NWS weather data products. The partners and stakeholders include external Government agencies (FAA, DOD, etc.,) commercial stakeholders (WSI, DTN, etc.,), International Weather agencies and a number of Research communities located at Universities across the country.</p>
<p>To collect and disseminate this data, the NWS uses a large variety of communications interfaces to collect and disseminate data with our various stakeholders and customers. These interfaces include FTP, HTTP, Socket, etc., across a complement of more than 150 circuits. The types of data handled by the NWSTG is primarily text based, but does include a wide range of binary and gridded weather products.</p>
<p>The role of the switching system in our view is to properly identify and validate each product/message arriving at the NWSTG, determine its role and ultimate destination. This can include a delivery process of a "one-to-many" or "many-to-one" to support NWSTG customers. It may also include stripping down the product/message and recreating it as a new product in order to meet customer requirements. Once the delivery requirements are identified for each weather product, the switching system will verify and validate the proper delivery of each product.</p>
<p><br />4.1.2 Message Switching:<br />The current NWSTG message switching system is running on IBM AIX systems using WebSphere MQ (WMQ) and WebSphere MQ Integrator (WMQI). The message system uses the WMQ and WMQI to identify new data for processing from within local repositories and processes them using pre-defined rule sets.<br /><br />In certain cases as per the set rules or header information the Switching system parses the data files and sends components of the file to other applications systems for further processing. These systems/applications will then take the data and produce various data products (specific sources, data, information etc.) The new products and data files are then placed in their own respective repositories. The new data products can be completely new files or same data files with a new WMO header. The switching system then takes the new data files/products and hands them to their respective systems and repositories for dissemination to NWS customers. This switching process will use pre-defined rule sets for handling the routing system switches this data to the respective dissemination repository based on the WMO headers and/or rules set with the system.</p>
<p>The data is also stored in databases for further processing and archiving. There are various background processes associated with the switching system that are used to process the data, which includes parsing data files, cleaning data files, storing data, reading WMO headers from files, creating and combining various weather products under new WMO headers for further processing and dissemination.</p>
<p>The current switching system provides management tools used to create new rule sets for data processing, data flow, format updates and changes, request reply features, and setting priority between various data files, and data flows for processing.</p>
<p>Once the switching system hands over the new products and/or the data files into their respective systems repositories, the dissemination systems then take over to send out the files.</p>
<p>4.1.3 Data Dissemination:<br />There are various systems and local applications which send or hosts data for partners and customers both nationally and internationally. The dissemination of weather products takes place through various mechanisms and protocols such as FTP, Sockets, LDM, DBnet, http, email, etc. The disseminating of the data to all customers in a timely manner is an element we cannot stress upon enough - the element of safety when you are sending weather warnings to protect life, limb, and property requires immediate delivery within our 24x7x365 operations environment.</p>
<p>4.1.4 Snapshot of Current Switching System:<br />The current message switching system is setup for high availability and efficiency. The current switching system daily averages include:<br />&bull; Number of Ingested weather products: 3,451,025<br />&bull; Number of switched messages per day: 12,678,602<br />&bull; Number of switched messages per minute: 8,804</p>
<p>4.2 Requirements:<br />NOAA NWS is looking for vendors to provide information and provide details of their products and/or solution that can replace the existing message switching system at NWSTG. NOAA NWS is looking for as much detail as possible that will enable us to understand the product, its capabilities for catering to the current and future growth of weather data and products.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  This is not a request for quotes and no contract will be awarded from this notice. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking businesses capable of ranking chemicals for reactivity using the Electrophilic Index to estimate relative rates of adduct reactions. This notice is a request for information from the business community. The Government invites contractors with the capability to provide services capable of linking predictable chemical reactivity-based protein adduct formation to a variety of target organ toxicities: Development of putative adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). The anticipated issuance date of the RFQ is on or about March 17, 2015. EPA anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with a delivery date of 180 days after EPA submits a list of the 100 chemicals to rank. This notice is a request for information from the business community. The Government invites contractors with the experience and capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements to submit a Capabilities Statement Package consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references, following the set format. The Government will not pay for any information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this evaluation. One of the main functions of this synopsis is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining whether there are businesses that can meet the Government's requirements and if a full and open competition, small business set-aside, or sole source is the appropriate strategy for this procurement. If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals.  Any and all businesses that are qualified to perform this work are encouraged to respond. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number 541380 applies to this requi rement and the small business size standard is $14M. It is requested that interested parties submit a brief Capabilities Statement package. The Capabilities Statement Package for this sources sought notice is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the company's ability to provide a service that matches the Government's specifications. The service's capabilities should match the following specifications: the contractor will rank 100 chemicals for their potential potency to produce hard or soft protein adducts in biological tissue. The US EPA will provide a list of chemicals that are of interest to EPA. Using the supplied list and the chemical literature, the Hard and Soft, Acids and Bases (HSAB) modeling contract will perform the structural analysis necessary to develop HSAB parameters (softness, hardness and electrophilicity) for each substance using quantum mechanical models. This work is expected to provide a sufficient range of chemicals from  which selections can be made for hypothesis-testing in future work. The Contractor will also develop plans for quality assurance. The Contractor shall perform the following tasks: provide a quality assurance plan that specifies how the tasks will be completed and documented, perform HSAB analysis and rank chemicals (based on softness, hardness and electrophilicity) that are provided by the EPA, provide EPA with output of HSAB analysis, including a list of chemicals ranked for reactivity in terms of potency, and discuss with EPA the strengths/limitations of the rankings and any confidence limits for the HSAB predictions and rankings. The company's capability statement should provide sufficient enough detail of its services for the Government to make a determination that the service meets the Government's requirement. Interested parties who believe they are capable of providing a service that meets the Government's requirement should provide a description of their company's s ervice and demonstrate how it meets the specifications of the Government's requirement. Respondents must include a company profile, to include company name, office location, point-of-contact information, DUNS number and CAGE Code, and number of employees. Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the capabilities package. Submission of capabilities statement package is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the EPA in tailoring the requirement to be consistent with industry capabilities. The determination to proceed with full and open competition is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties who believe that they are capable and qualified to provide this service should respond to this announcement by the response date below. Responses to this announcement shall be transmitted via email to the following address:  williams.louis@epa.gov. Responses must be rec eived no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Time on March 10, 2015 to be considered. Please address any comments or questions regarding this sources sough notice to Louis Williams, EPA RTPPOD OARM, EPA Research Triangle Park, NC, Code AA005 via the above address. Telephonic submissions and questions will not be entertained.

<DESC>Solicitation #: 15-PHL_MAR
<p>Procurement Type: Sources Sought</p>
<p>Title: Lease of Office Space in the areas of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware and its Surrounding Counties within Region 3.</p>
<p>RLP #15-PHL - OFFICE SPACE</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 531190-Leasing of Building Space to Federal Government by Owners</p>
<p>Summary:<br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in March.</p>
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for March is March 1, 2015 to March 07, 2015, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through FY 2015 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2014, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2015 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   ** You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP.  Your previous offered space will not be copied.<br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within the following boundaries:  Philadelphia, Montgomery, Delaware, Bucks, and Chester counties in Pennsylvania; Camden, Burlington, and Gloucester counties in New Jersey; and New Castle County in Delaware.  <br />Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

As part of the design/build design proposal, the contractor may provide proposals to utilize the existing base fire alarm equipment and qualify the expected usable life remaining in the existing backbone equipment.

The contractor shall provide or evaluate the total system replacement with comparable fire alarm system equipment. The contractor can investigate reutilization of existing conduit and backbone wiring for fire alarm panels and workstations installed in 2008 or later, however wiring for older systems shall be replaced, as wiring often is the leading cause of system trouble or nuisance alarms. </span></p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in March.<br /><br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects. The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'. Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.

The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements. Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov). Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>

<DESC>SLAC seeks vendors that can provide the following:
<p><br />A set of four carbon fiber blades (approximately 800mm long X 500mm wide X 4.4mm thick) to be used in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) shutter prototype. The LSST Camera Shutter controls exposure duration and interrupts light while the image is read out and the telescope is being re-positioned for the next exposure. It is a double-bladed guillotine style mechanical shutter that lies tightly packaged between the L3 lens/cryostat window and the filter and its exchange system. The shutter controls the length of time that the sensors on the focal plane are exposed to an image while blocking out all stray light when closed during read-out of the CCD sensors. The shutter is a two-blade design, where flat blades move across the focal plane to start or end an exposure. This double-acting shutter includes two shutter blade stacks. The first opens to one side to expose the field of view (FOV), beginning the exposure; then, the second blade set occludes the FOV by deploying from the opposite side, traveling in the same direction as the first. For the next exposure, the process is reversed. This provides a uniform exposure time for all pixels, since the first pixel exposed by the trailing edge of the first blade stack is also the first blocked by the leading edge of the second stack.</p>
<p><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. VENDORS INTERESTED IN BEING CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE SHOULD IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS AN "INTERESTED PARTY" VIA THE FBO PORTAL. DO NOT CONTACT THE SUBCONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. <br>  <br> This notice is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a solicitation. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) is seeking to determine the degree of interest and capability by U.S. businesses only in conducting clinician training on select biological agents in focused areas of East Africa: Uganda and Kenya.   <br>   <br> USAMRIID wishes to leverage relationships with key players in academic, medical professional and government organizations in order to deliver a useful, self-sustaining training product focused on the desires and needs of the Ugandan and Kenyan health care professionals.  With assistance from an experienced contractor the objectives of Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) for self-sustainment by the host country as well as potentially forming a central regional training hub for surrounding nations (namely Kenya) can be achieve.  <br>  <br> The requirement also encourages expansion of these training relationships into potential research collaborations when aligned with respective missions and resources.  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) mission of providing training to health care professionals in various aspects of diseases caused by especially dangerous pathogens requires an effective and efficient platform for clinician in-service training. The contractor's training program shall offer a well established infrastructure, networking, curriculum evaluation and course development resources.  The Contractor Training Program shall also maintain sustainability of the end product (a trained cadre of clinicians) by following-up after the training, maintaining a database of qualified trainers and offering reasonable compensation for their time and efforts.  The contractor is required to conducts research and analyses of the training outcomes as well as clinical research that employs the training that clinicians received.  The contractor will be required to travel to other African countries, which facilitates dissemination and oversight of the DTRA CBEP training to areas of restricted access by USAMRIID.  <br>  <br> Responses must clearly demonstrate capabilities through examples of previous and/ or current clinician training on select biological agents along with the required established infrastructure, networking, curriculum evaluation and course development resources in the African country of Uganda and Kenya.    <br>  <br> Vendors must at a minimum address the following: <br>  <br> -Capability to function as an integrating entity on the ground in Uganda and Kenya to assist USAMRIID with its mission to provide clinician training on selected biological agents of Ugandan & Kenyan concern.   <br>  <br> - Demonstrate extensive history and trusted, collegial relationship with key players in academic, medical professional and government organizations. Such as experience working with Makerere University and other prestigious academic institutions (Johns Hopkins, CDC and the Infectious Diseases Society of America).  <br>  <br> -Ability to use that architecture as well as its co-location on Makerere University to efficiently plan, collaborate, facilitate and execute the training.   <br>  <br> -Ability to provide financial, administrative, consultative and logistical support services that complement the USAMRIID training activities for Ugandan and Kenyan clinicians.   <br>  <br> - Demonstrate the infrastructure, networking, curriculum evaluation and course development resources already constructed to support training initiatives in the Eastern African country with goals similar (albeit different public health issues) as USAMRIID and DTRA CBEP.   <br>  <br> -Demonstrate organization structure suited for creating an effective learning environment tailored to suit the needs and learning styles of separate audiences, e.g., community nurses through advanced degree health care specialists  <br>  <br> -Ability to identify key host-nation physicians receiving training who will participate in further course-development opportunities by applying training principles to clinical Especially Dangerous Pathogens (EDP) characterization, obtaining specimens or clinical data from patients with EDP), aid in upgrading course content with relevant clinical information, assist in development of appropriate animal models, construct improved patient management practices and conduct improved disease surveillance programs.  <br>  <br>  <br> The Government anticipates a single indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract with a Period of Performance of one (1) twelve-month base period plus four (4) twelve-month option periods. Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Notice, the Government will determine whether a sole source acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Government's best interest. It is requested that all interested parties submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length) demonstrating its ability to perform the requested services and prior experience with similar requirements.  <br>  <br> Responses are due on Monday, March 10, 2015 by 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  <br>  <br> The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. <br>  <br> Capability statements are to be sent by emailed, attn: Sharon Smith, email: sharon.r.smith.civ@mail.mil.  <br>

<p>(1) What parts of the PWS are unclear to you? What parts would be difficult to price?<br />(2) What recommendations do you have to clarify the requirements of this PWS?<br />(3) Which requirements are the major cost or price drivers?<br />(4) What information or type of information, if any, would assist you in writing a technical or price proposal?<br />(5) What Government Furnished Material would you require for successful performance of the required tasks? <br />(6) What recommendations do you have regarding increased efficiency or effectiveness of processes for software maintenance? <br />(7) What recommendations do you have on ways to phrase the requirements within the PWS to better promote competition?</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information is for planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The Government Performance and Results Act (1993) and the Clinger-Cohen Act (1996) require Federal executive agencies to measure the results of their major programs and to establish processes to measure the contribution of their information technology (IT) investments to mission results.  With healthcare information technology (IT) expenditures rising to over $22.6 billion in 2007, healthcare organizations need to understand which investments provide actual business benefits. 
To maximize the benefits achieved from these investments, The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) established the Product Effectiveness (PE) program office to perform various assessments and analyses on specially selected health care programs, products, and processes to ensure they are effective and/or meet the needs of end-users. PE is organized into four (4) separate but interrelated domains: (1) Functional Reviews, (2) Customer Satisfaction, (3) Lessons Learned, and (4) Benefits Realization. The Customer Satisfaction Program collects, analyzes and reports qualitative information on significant programs, processes, technology, and medical products from VA stakeholders to measure their effectiveness and help improve them. The program is responsible for developing comprehensive qualitative evaluation plans; planning and performing data collection; analyzing results; identifying impacts and benefits; and making recommendations on improving the effectiveness of healthcare technology products and associated processes. Objectives include validating investment decisions, providing accountability, and supporting continuous improvement of VHA mission critical health informatics projects.
This contract supports the administration of Customer Satisfaction engagements for the VHA Product Effectiveness Program. This Scope of Work describes services required to support the Customer Satisfaction program in alignment with the goals and objectives of the PE organization.
The VHA QSV PE program office is establishing a contract for Customer Satisfaction Services. This will entail the Contractor to provide services to initiate, plan, and execute projects, also referred to as CS Engagements.   Activities to be performed include the following:

a)	Effectively initiate, facilitate, plan and execute customer satisfaction projects. 

b)	Gather information from multiple stakeholders and sources, this may include: clinical, business, managerial and technical staff; databases; literature searches, and reports. Stakeholders also represent numerous work settings, including: clinical/health care delivery environments, administrative, operational, and logistical.

c)	Create specific deliverables for the purposes of administering, documenting, reporting, analyzing, and communicating the results of activities and to support continuous process improvement.

The CS Engagements will be chosen based on the needs of the PE program in its support of VHA Strategic Goals.  

Engagement Descriptions 
Engagements are planned for the following Veterans Health Administration (VHA) initiatives and/or program offices:

"	Office of Strategic Integration
"	Connected Health
"	Chief Business Office
"	Patient Centered Care
"	Pharmacy
"	Patient Flow Management

Please note the listed engagements are examples of the planned subject matter and/or content of these services and are subject to change depending on the needs of the PE program. In the event any of the above planned engagements are changed, a comparable level of effort for the new engagement(s) will be required regardless of the subject matter.  
Engagements Requested
CS engagements are generally classified into three sizes: Large, Medium, and Small. Per the CS Process & Procedures document, each engagement is divided into four unique phases. Each engagement always has at least one phase (Phase 1 - Due Diligence), but may require up to four phases.  For example, one large engagement may consist of only Phase 1, while another may require all four phases. The CS Program Manager will assign each phase during the course of each engagement.

The services described shall apply to the following engagements.  These engagements may be staggered throughout the period of performance.  






Schedule of CS Engagements and Phases Requested:

Large Engagement(s): 1.1 - 1.8
Phase	Quantity
1.	Due Diligence	8
2.	Planning	5
3.	Execution	2
4.	Lessons Learned	2

Medium Engagement(s): 1.9 - 1.12 
Phase	Quantity
1.	Due Diligence	4
2.	Planning	3
3.	Execution	3
4.	Lessons Learned	3

Small Engagement(s): 1.13 - 1.22 
Phase	Quantity
1.	Due Diligence	10
2.	Planning	6
3.	Execution	6
4.	Lessons Learned	6


All of the above services identified in the Schedule of CS Engagements and Phases Requested include a Due Diligence phase. Engagements consisting only of phase 1 are also referred to as Due Diligence only engagements.  Generally, phase 1 activities are estimated to take 10, 8 and 6 weeks to complete for large, medium, and small engagements, respectively. However, these estimates are subject to change due to their dependence on multiple factors that could either reduce or extend their durations.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission 's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		8455-00-NIB-0040<br />Name:		Neck Lanyard, Cord Style, J-Hook, Black, 36" x .25"<br />Description:	36" x .25", lightweight, non-breakaway, fabric neck lanyard cord with metal J-hook. Cord color is black. J-hook is made of sturdy metal. Clip allows for users to easily attach and detach identification cards and other items for quick availability. UOI is DZ.</p>
<p>NSN:		8455-00-NIB-0041<br />Name:		Neck Lanyard, Strap Style, J-Hook, Black, 36" x .75"<br />Description:	36" x .75", lightweight, non-breakaway, fabric neck strap lanyard with metal J-hook. Strap color is black. J-hook is made of sturdy metal. Clip allows for users to easily attach and detach identification cards and other items for quick availability. UOI is DZ.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			8455-00-NIB-0040<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	BAU 68909; BAU 68939; BAU 68903; BAU 68902; AVT75480</p>
<p>NSN:			8455-00-NIB-0041<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	BAU 65619; BAU 69514; AVT75426; BAU 69321; AVT75568; AVT75425; BAU 69324; AVT75424</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no adverse impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please visit http://abilityone.gov/distributors/potential.html for more information.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than March 16, 2015 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have NASA Langley has developed a new aircraft design with the engine nacelle over the wing, improving engine ground clearance and freeing landing gear design. While previous over-the-wing designs have produced unacceptably high drag conditions, the new NASA design reduces drag on the wing. By optimizing the nacelle design and the wing leading edge location, NASAs design confines the shock to the leading edge of the wing. Also, placing the exhaust nozzle over the wing reduces noise to the communities below.  NASA developed the novel configuration to address the drag penalties associated with traditional over-the-wing nacelle designs. As shown in Figure 1, the novel features of the wing design include the unswept inboard wing section between the fuselage and the nacelle with an extended chord. The chord is extended so that it is almost in line with the front face of the nacelle, promoting near two-dimensional channel flow between the nacelle and the fuselage that pulls the standing shock wave farther forward. Confining the shock naturally enhances the leading edge suction and eliminates the shock traditionally located near the trailing edge. The net effect is reduced compressibility-based interference drag, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the drag coefficient, multiplied by wing chord, for the over-the-wing nacelle (OWN) compared to an under- wing nacelle (UWN) and a wing with no nacelle at all. Noise is reduced because the engine nozzle is tangential to the wing upper surface and near the middle of the wing chord to put the exhaust noise source in the best position to be shielded from the community by the wing below it.  The configuration has been assessed using both inviscid Euler and viscous Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have Researchers at NASAs Langley Research Center have developed an airplane capable of being stowed in a confined volume and deployed in a high altitude environment for extended duration flight operations in a low-density atmosphere. Engineers, scientists, and end users can take advantage of this innovation that provides previously unattainable high altitude flight operations. The airplane is delivered to a specified altitude folded in a container or rocket. Once released, the plane unfolds and executes a pull-up maneuver to stabilize altitude. In addition, the current suite of onboard scientific instrumentation includes magnetometers, a mass spectrometer, and variable use cameras. NASA is seeking market insights on commercialization of the new airplane design, and welcomes interest from potential producers, users, and licensees.  The airplane can be folded in a confined volume, transported by a carrier vehicle, and deployed after delivery to terrestrial or extra-terrestrial venues. The innovation includes the stowaway capsule, and the aerodynamic design of the airplane enables flight in low-density atmospheres such as on Mars. The airplane configuration includes the airfoil sections, folding method, and the outer mold line. The plane has the capability to maneuver in the Martian atmosphere at an atmospheric pressure comparable to 100,000 feet above sea level on Earth.  During flight operations, the airplane employs a host of scientific instrumentation for study of atmospheric properties such as composition, chemistry, and dynamic behavior.  It can also map crustal magnetism for improved understanding of crustal evolution and tectonic history and detect near-surface hydrogen abundance to locate underground water and hydrated minerals.  NASA developed the Mars airplane to improve measurement resolution capabilities beyond that of ground rovers and satellite surveyors. The use of an extended-flight, maneuverable airplane in low-density atmospheric conditions provides previously unavailable planetary research capabilities.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have a novel lifting and precision positioning device with hybrid functional characteristics of both crane-type lifting devices and robotic manipulators. The design of the Lunar Surface Manipulation System (LSMS) allows for fine positioning with complete control over both translation and rotation of the payload. In addition, the design permits several other operations using a wide variety of special purpose tools, such as a bucket, pallet forks, grappling devices, sensor and visualization packages, and dexterous robotic arms that can be quickly added to the tip. NASA is seeking development partners and potential licensees.  NASA Langley developed the LSMS because of the need for a versatile system capable of performing multiple functions on the lunar surface, such as unloading components from a lander, transporting components to an operational site and installing them, and supporting service and replacement during component life. Current devices used for in-space operations are designed to work on orbit (zero g) only and thus do not have sufficient strength to operate on planetary surfaces. Traditional cranes are specialized to the task of lifting and are not capable of manipulator-type positioning operations.  The innovations incorporated into the LSMS allow it to lower payloads to the ground over a significant portion of the workspace without use of a hoist, functioning like a robot manipulator, thus providing a rigid connection and very precise control of the payload. The LSMS uses a truss architecture with pure compression and tension members to achieve a lightweight design. The innovation of using multiple spreaders (like spokes in a wheel) allows the LSMS to maintain its high structural efficiency throughout its full range of motion. Rod portions of the tension members automatically lift off and re-engage the spreaders as the joint articulates, allowing a large range of motion while maintaining mechanical advantage. In addition, the LSMS uses a quick-change device at the tip end that enables automated acquisition of end effectors or special purpose tools to increase its versatility.

<a href="mailto:Orville.landicho@va.gov">orville.landicho@va.gov</a>
<DESC>The VA VISN 21 intends to negotiate a sole source contract with ECRI. The proposed contract action is for an ECRI Membership - Health Devices Gold. This is requirement is to provide access to the following database and website for an unlimited number of users at the VISN 21 VAMCs: Health Devices System, Healthcare Product Comparison System, Sourcebase, Medical Device Evaluations, Guidance Articles on Medical Technology Issues, Problem Device Reporting, Device Alerts and Recalls, Universal Medical Device Naming System device and manufacturer codes, and Consultation.

This sole source action is in accordance with the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES and no solicitation will be issued; however, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer for consideration. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements. Responses are due by March 6, 2015 at 2:00 PM PST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Responses must be e-mailed to orville.landicho@va.gov .  No telephone responses will be accepted.  No reimbursement for any costs associated with providing capability statements will be provided by the Government.

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 

2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Subscription to the ECRI Institute Health Devices Gold tool. The subscription will be used to access medical equipment evaluations, guidance
articles, reports, and patient safety alerts. The PR will include a base year + four years options. 


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Evaluations of medical equipment reliability, safety, cost effectiveness, human factors, and other elements are essential to purchasing and using
medical technology safely and effectively. Evaluations are completed by ECRI and independent engineering and clinical professionals and
distributed to medical facilities via the Health Devices Gold tool. ECRI also publishes Hazard Reports and User Experience Network articles to
identify problems involving medical devices that present a possible source of danger or difficulty but which have not yet been identified by vendors
or the FDA as reasons to issue Field Safety Notifications. Additionally, ECRI distributes routine Health Device Alert newsletters, compiling recalls,
hazards, product safety alerts, and reported problems involving a broad range of medical devices and supplies. Health Device Alerts augment the
facility recalls notification process by providing direct access to a number of recall sources.

4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
No other service is known to provide all required information in one consolidated tool. ECRI Institute is the sole, proprietary provider of the research, and analyses, offered through our membership programs, and hold the copyright to the published materials provided via these programs.


5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Completed several internet searches for Emergency Care Research Institute or similar product suppliers and manufacturers using Google, VetBiz, DSBS, GSA e-Library, GSA Advantage, FPDS and SAM websites.

"	Contacted UNICOR (FPI), Ability One and searched their website catalog (http://www.abilityone.com/OA_HTML/ibeCZzpHome.jsp?minisite=10040&respid=22372&grp=IBE_M_OTHER and http://www.unicor.gov/). Market Research determined that the requisition is not available through Ability One and UNICOR.  
"	Searched DSBS and VetBiz websites. The searched revealed that there are small business vendors that have the same NAICS code, but small businesses could not deliver the requisitions because the online subscription is peculiar to one contractor and the manufacturer has a proprietary data right for its products. ECRI is the standard tool utilized by VA Medical Centers Nationally for consolidated recall access, equipment comparisons, and educational tools. No other service is known to provide all required information in one consolidated tool.
"	The GSA website revealed that the requirement is not on a GSA.
"	The NAICS code is 519130 and the requirement is below $150K; therefore, it will not be reviewed by SAOW/OSDBU.   
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Access to the gate installation site is over a narrow dirt road with minimal turn around areas so coordination with the onsite personnel is needed for off-loading of the gate as close to the installation location as possible for the delivery vehicle. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS BEING ISSUED CONCURRENTLY WITH THE SOLICITATION.
<p>Description: NSN 2530-01-394-4794-HUB,WHEEL,VEHICULAR being bought in accordance with BAE SYSTEMS TACTICAL VEHICLE (0FW39) P/N KIT 4727 or MERITOR HEAVY VEHICLE SYSTEMS LLC (78500) P/N KIT 4759. PLEASE NOTE: DEALERS MAY BE ASKED TO PROVIDE TRACEABILITY TO THE OEM. Based on market research this item is a commercial item and will be solicited using FAR Part 13.5 procedures. The required quantity is 249 each, FOB ORIGIN and inspection at DESTINATION is required. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfq after the issue date of 03/20/2015. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in US dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. This solicitation will be released on a RFQ and it is to be returned to the buyer at Defense Supply Center Columbus, PO Box 3990, Columbus, OH 43218-3990, ATTN: Mindy R Messerly, PLCLBCE, or can be emailed (mindy.messerly@dla.mil). The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307</p>

To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.

(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Stacey Swader Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-4825 Email: stacey.l.swader.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.02 per hour or $160.80 per week or $696.79 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product 	Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ 	___________________ <br />___________________ 	___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<SUBJECT>Architect-Engineer (A/E) Services for the Tenant Backfill Project at the John Weld Peck Federal Building in Cincinnati, Ohio
<SOLNBR>GS-05P-15-SL-C-0022
<RESPDATE>040115
<CONTACT>William M. Chapman, Contracting Officer, Phone 3123530868, Email william.chapman@gsa.gov
<DESC>PROJECT: J.W. Peck Tenant Backfill, Cincinnati, Ohio<br />BUILDING TYPE: Federal Office Building<br />SIZE: 220,000 square feet<br />BUDGET: $29 to $35 million <br />FUNDING: Funds Are Not Currently Available<br /><br />Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.<br /><br />In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, the facility will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements. The project intends to strive for LEED Gold.<br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br /><br />The J.W. Peck Federal Building is a 10 story office building located at 550 Main Street in the heart of downtown Cincinnati.  Region 5 has identified the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Energy (DOE), Social Security Administration Office of Disability Adjudication Review (SSA ODAR), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and U.S. Trustees (UST) as tenants who could backfill vacant space within the building.  GSA is currently analyzing the available options.<br /><br />The current project proposes to renovate approximately 220,000 sq ft within the J.W. Peck Federal Building.  Improvements would include restacking the IRS within the building and renovating their current space, as well as renovating building vacant space for incoming tenants.  The project will be renovating only interior customer spaces and will not provide improvements to any public spaces.  However, an increased heat load on the building may require modifications to the HVAC system and rebalancing.<br /><br />IRS currently occupies 165,000 USF within the Peck and 65,000 USF in leased space. IRS needs to reduce, collocate, consolidate space and lower their rental costs. They plan to do so by completely eliminating the 60,000 USF of leased space and reconfiguring space within the Peck to implement new workplace strategies. They have requested a final total of approximately 115,000 USF of space in the Peck Building to accommodate this move and restacking effort. This is a large reduction of almost 115,000 USF in total.<br /><br />GSA proposes that 4 other agencies move leases into the Peck building with the following space requirements:  DOE at 80,000 sq ft, US Trustees at 4,200 sq ft, SSA ODAR at 21,000 sq ft, and OSHA at 6,500 sq ft.<br /><br />SCOPE OF WORK<br /><br />The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, engineering, interior design, furniture design, interior space planning, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, Building Information Modeling (BIM), computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) administration, Information Technology, Audio Visual, security, and post-construction contract services (PCCS). The project is also to include GSA design standards, conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), minimum LEED Gold requirements, and customer agency requirements.  GSA aims to minimize tenant disruption and the use of swing space through construction phasing.<br /><br />SELECTION PROCESS<br /><br />This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.<br />B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as "No Charge" by entering "NC" in the unit price. <br />c.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC>**update** If you wish to compete on this please see FedBid posting 701072. This is where quotes should be sent. Closing will be Friday (3/6/2015) <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  The government would like to hold a site visit so all competing vendors have a chance to see exactly what the upgrade entails. The site visit will be at Building 606 Thayer Road, West Point, NY on Tuesday (2/24/2015) at 1000. If you have any questions with the location or would like to RSVP, contact contract specialist Manuel Medeiros at Manuel.Medeiros@usma.edu or 845-938-3120. This site visit is not mandatory but it is highly recommended.   <br>    <br>  The primary purpose of this upgrade is to add three-way High Definition (HD) Video TeleConference (VTC) capability: commercial VTC on a dedicated computer that is also capable of conferencing through the existing USMA VTC conference bridge infrastructure. The VTC will have an HD (digital) camera. Given the distance between the camera and the equipment rack, a camera cable extension solution for video and control is required.   <br>    <br>  Commercial WiFi installed to provide visitors with web capability.   <br>    <br>  DAD Backdrop (hideable/retracting) behind presenter's area.   <br>    <br>  Rewire existing network switches under tables to conform to the new VTC addition.   <br>    <br>  Additional Extron AV trac.   <br>    <br>  Cabling to secure existing projectors.   <br>    <br>  Mobile Crestron control panel.   <br>    <br>  If technically possible, provide capability for two Laptops on the table to project to these existing projectors simultaneously.   <br>    <br>  The camera and all microphones must be directly available to all VTC/ATC systems.   <br>  Environmental vibration mitigated for both existing projectors.   <br>    <br>  The upgraded system should support wireless devices, including IPADs, IPhones, androids, and other similar devices for presentations and for sharing content during VTCs.   <br>    <br>  The upgraded system should include an automated camera backdrop system that includes the USMA logo to present the highest quality and highest impact video impression.   <br>    <br>  We would like an additional control to be added with an IPAD and docking station recharger that can be used without removing the protective sleeve.  <br>    <br>

Access to the site is achieved by turning south from Highway 40 on 9500 East in the town of Jensen.   The street 9500 East leads directly to the Stewart Lake Waterfowl Management Area.  Coordination with on-site personnel will be required for access to the area through a secured gate.
Access to the gate installation site is over a narrow dirt road with minimal turn around areas so coordination with the onsite personnel is needed for off-loading of the gate as close to the installation location as possible for the delivery vehicle. <BR> <BR>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Senior Program Manager is a member of the USAID Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Field Programs Division, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designed, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five regional teams: Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK), Africa (AFR), Middle East (ME), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and Yemen, Europe &amp; Eurasia, and Asia (YEA). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>OTI is looking to hire Senior Program Managers for multiple regional teams, which will be determined upon hiring.  At the time of this solicitation, OTI is looking to fill expected vacancies on its Middle East and Afghanistan/Pakistan teams, but the final team assignments will depend on office needs at the time of award. The Senior Program Manager will work in close coordination with the relevant Regional Team Leader to establish an effective team, manage existing country programs, participate in new country program design, assessments, and develop and maintain collaborative and productive relationships with counterparts throughout USAID and the Interagency.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Senior Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Senior Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the assigned DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, the Senior Program Manager will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future program strategies in high priority countries;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>

<p>&bull;	When required, supervise staff as delegated by the Regional Team Leader (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring to staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel, program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to embassies and USAID Missions may also include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate in country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and/or participate in the selection of program implementers such as grantees, contractors, and personal services contractors. Within guidelines provided by the Regional Team Leader, negotiate program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental (NGO) counterparts;</p>
<p>&bull;	Although not a policy maker, the individual influences program policy by reason of recognized expertise in the particular field of development assistance;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support of implementation and management of assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts overseas for up to three months if required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop, monitor, evaluate and recommend performance measures for country programs and individual projects, including contractors and grantees;</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with NGOs, international donors, Department of State, U.S. Government agencies and others interested in particular OTI country programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate with other DCHA offices, USAID divisions, the Department of State, the National Security Council, and other U.S. Government agencies and departments;</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI in high-level conferences and meetings, explain and interpret policies and requirements to others, and negotiate important issues with other groups, the USAID Mission (if present), the Department of State, the National Security Council, and other U.S. Government agencies and departments;</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate and assist with the conceptualization of new OTI-wide program options including analytic frameworks and strategic objectives. Participate in the design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, act as Regional Team Leader during his/her absence, or in other Regional Team roles (e.g. Deputy or Country Representative in the field for short periods of time);</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful implementation of programs within the guidelines provided by the Regional Team Leader.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS Announcement (SSSA). SSSAs are issued to assist the agency in performing market research to determine industry interest and sourcing capability. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. This is not a guarantee of a future request for proposal or an award. This document should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the U.S. Government. Any information provided to the Government in response to this document will become Defense Threat Reduction Agency and United States Strategic Command Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (DTRA/SCC-WMD) property and will not be returned. The Government will not reimburse contractors for any costs associated with responding to this Sources Sought notice.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a single Time &amp; Materials &lsquo;C' type contract, not to exceed 60 months inclusive of the base period and all option years. The estimated ceiling of the contract is anticipated to range between $100-140 million.</p>
<p>The DTRA/SCC-WMD Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) directly addresses global health security threats by working with partner nations and other stakeholders to improve biosafety, biosecurity, and disease surveillance for traditional select agents (weapons-usable biological material) and emerging pathogens that may cause public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC).</p>
<p>The purpose of this SSSA is to identify potential sources with the requisite experience and skill sets required to perform the DTRA/SCC-WMD CBEP mission requirements of the proposed Scientific &amp; Technical Engagement Partnership (STEP). Through the STEP Program, CBEP will partner with a variety of collaborators (including research institutions, non-governmental organizations, and local scientists) to develop collaborative research programs, leading the way for future CBEP engagements. These activities will be augmented with specialized training in areas such as public health preparedness and emergency response; biological containment research and containment facilities engineering; One Health field surveillance and outbreak response; and, biosafety and biosecurity. The North American Industry Classification System Codes for this requirement are 928120, 541712 and 541690.</p>
<p>The contract will build a long-term partnership between strong research and technical centers and CBEP partner country institutions that will nourish and grow hypothesis-driven research programs that result in sustainable funding and academic publications. As a result of STEP engagements, CBEP partner countries will also have reduced the potential impact of biological threats through enhanced biological safety and security, awareness of biological risks, and knowledge related to biological pathogens.</p>
<p>Potential sources, either alone or with appropriate teaming partners, must have demonstrated expertise and capability to perform worldwide in all physical and operational environments as detailed in the attached DRAFT Statement of Objectives.</p>
<p>Contractors who believe they possess the expertise and experience may submit a written statement, not to exceed one page in length, including:</p>
<p>&bull; An overview of the company's technical capabilities clearly indicating the ability to perform the tasks as delineated in the DRAFT Statement of Objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Any small businesses that believe they can accomplish this entire requirement as the prime under a Time &amp; Materials contract should indicate their small business status (See Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 19) in their capability statement.</p>

<DESC>This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The DEA is not at this time seeking proposals. The purpose of this RFI is to seek industry information about existing commercially available real-time and non- real-time tracking systems. This RFI is not seeking information about commercially available real-time and non- real-time tracking systems which are in the developmental phase. DEA consistently seeks to obtain information and comments from industry that will provide the agency with insight into market conditions and/or scientific advances that will aid in the refinements of requirements and the formation of an acquisition strategy for tracking technology systems. This RFI is designed to conduct market research to determine the current level of technology and availability of such technology in the current market. DEA is interested in obtaining information related to existing, fully developed, and integrated commercially available tracking technology that effectively integrates Global Positioning System (GPS), wireless communication systems, and customized mapping and data distribution software. Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist DEA in determining the potential level of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability of the Small Business community to fulfill this requirement. However, responses to this RFI are solicited from all interested parties. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a requirement for a family of real-time and non-real-time tracking equipment to meet the operational requirements of the tracking program currently in operation throughout DEA. The equipment shall be compatible with the current Centralized Tracking System (CTS) used to monitor and track all DEA assets and investigative targets. The tracker shall be self-contained and include all necessary components to install, collect and transmit, via wireless technology, GPS data (latitude, longitude, time, date, and velocity) to a remote tracking terminal station. The ability to remotely command and monitor tracker status shall exist. The tracker shall have as a minimum the following programmable features: GPS sample rate ( minimum 5 seconds), motion detection, scheduled and unscheduled callouts (phone, e-mail, pager), Geo-fence (entrance, and exit alarms) and power management (Sleep, Wake on motion, Full on). The actual tracking device power specifications shall be DC operated with the following power requirements: power inputs shall be protected against polarity reversal., internal power regulation shall allow operation from a power source rated between 9VDC and l SVDC, maximum total device current during operation shall not exceed 1OOma. During sleep mode the maximum current shall not exceed 1Oma, The maximum physical size shall not exceed 4.7" x 2.8" x 1.75" to include connectors, magnets, mounts, and tie wrap loops and the maximum weight shall not exceed two pounds, excluding batteries. The tracking devices shall have a built-in capacity to store at least 200,000 GPS records. Non-volatile memory shall be used to prevent data lost during power outages or operating in non&shy;coverage areas. While operating in non-coverage areas, GPS records shall be stored in onboard memory and automatically downloaded once the tracking device is within coverage. Devices that are designed as data loggers shall retain all GPS data records in memory until downloaded. If GPS tracking records are stored in a format other than industry standard NEMA, the contractor shall provide the necessary software conversion tools to allow the data to be exported to data analysis programs such as Microsoft Access and/or Excel. As a minimum, tracking records shall include data fields that record the target&rsquo;s latitude, longitude, time, speed, and block street address. The mapping software as a minimum shall have the capability to perform data search and sorts on these fields. All tracking devices shall have as a minimum, one (1) input control line that can read the status of a switch (open or closed), and one ( 1) output line that can be remotely commanded to switch a one ( 1) amp load. Switching inputs/outputs are not required on devices that are designed to be used as data loggers. All tracking devices shall operate in the following environment with no degradation in operational performance: operating temperature range of -20F to 140F, relative humidity of 5% to 95%, water resistance equivalent to that as sprayed from a garden hose for three (3) minutes, survive a one ( 1) meter drop onto a concrete surface as well as vibrational forces that are associated with the exterior surfaces of a moving vehicle. All power cables, input/output cables, programming cables, antennas (GPS and Cellular), and documentation necessary to install the tracking device using either the vehicles power source or an external battery source should be provided with each tracking device. Tracking devices shall operate using commercially available communication protocols and standards.

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) will issue a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 10 year concession contract to provide for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services at the Mammoth Cave Hotel within Mammoth Cave National Park. The Director, pursuant to 36 C.F.R. Part 51, has determined the existing Concessioner is NOT a preferred Offeror for the Contract to be awarded.<br /><br />As an attraction, Mammoth Cave predates all national parks in the United States: historic records report that people first started visiting the cave in 1816, and it became internationally known by the mid-1800s. Congress authorized Mammoth Cave National Park on May 25, 1926. The purpose of Mammoth Cave National Park is to preserve the cave system, including Mammoth Cave, the scenic river valleys of the Green and Nolin rivers, and a section of south central Kentucky for recreational use, particularly the hilly country north of Green River. The Park contains the longest recorded cave system in the world with more than 400 miles explored and mapped. The Park was designated a World Heritage Site on October 27, 1981, and became the core area of an International Biosphere Reserve on September 26, 1990. <br /><br />The Concession Business Opportunity is comprised of Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services: <br />The Concessioner will operate the Mammoth Cave Hotel which includes the Sunset Terrace Lodge, the Historic Cottages, and the Woodland Cottages, a full service dining room and a new fast casual facility, a gift shop located in the Mammoth Cave Hotel offering merchandise and Kentucky-made crafts. Additionally, the Concessioner will operate the Camper Store at the Service Center Complex, which provides grocery, camping supplies, and convenience items. The Concessioner also currently operates eight buses to transport approximately 42 percent of cave tour visitors from the visitor center to various cave entrances. Other required services include vending, kennels, and public shower/laundry services within its facilities. Gross revenues from 2010-2012 have been between $3,814,646 and $3,990,194.
<p>A site visit will be held on February 4, 2015 at Mammoth Cave National Park. Please RSVP at least one week in advance if you plan to attend the site visit by contacting Bruce Powell, Deputy Superintendent at (270) 758-2186 or email bruce_powell@nps.gov. The site visit will be an opportunity for all interested parties to get an overview of the concession operation along with a tour of Concession Facilities associated with the Draft Contract.</p>
<p>Questions related to the Prospectus must be submitted in writing, via email to Bruce Powell, Deputy Superintendent, Mammoth Cave National Park, at bruce_powell@nps.gov, no later than Thursday, February 12, 2015.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY for the purpose of exploring alternative solutions and determining industry standards for operations and maintenance services and custodial services in government facilities. In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), the information requested is for planning purposes only and is not intended to bind the Government. This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB) or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change. The General Services Administration has not made a commitment to procure any of the services discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regard to its submission. The Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.
<p>Description:</p>
<p>GSA is seeking information from industry in the areas of Operation and Maintenance Services, and Custodial Services to reduce costs with minimal impact to the satisfaction of the tenants. We are seeking expert solutions that may result in changes to the attached scope of work that would achieve substantial costs savings. Some examples are reducing required reports, more streamlined maintenance programs, PM frequencies, or which requirements can be eliminated or reduced? To your knowledge how often has GSA provided feedback saying how we use reports, or how we benefited from them? How can current installed technology reduce staff levels? How big of a risk is the $2500 repair threshold? What risks currently born by the contractor, can be shifted back to GSA?<br /><br />GSA is open to any suggestions for modifying or eliminating requirements per the scope of work. If you would like to provide us with a commercial statement of work that you feel is comparable and would yield the same outcome, please provide a copy to us. We appreciate your time and effort in responding to this request for information.</p>
<p>Requested Information</p>
<p>The response to this RFI will be in writing submitted to the point of contact below. Any individual or institution may respond to this RFI, and there is no limit on the number of responses that an individual or institution may submit.</p>
<p>The response should contain the following information:</p>
<p>-- Name of submitter and contact information (institutional affiliation, E-mail address).</p>
<p>-- Cite specific sections and page numbers in the attached documents with recommended revisions.</p>
<p>-- Key aspects and description of the revised technical approach to delivering these services.</p>
<p>-- Identification of potential synergies between GSA and service contractors that could offer opportunities for cost reductions.</p>
<p>Submissions to this RFI are due by 4:00 pm CST,&nbsp;16 March 2015.&nbsp; (This was extended from March 9th to allow more time for document reviews and RFI preparation.)</p>
<p>GSA recognizes the need to protect proprietary information and does not intend to broadly disseminate the RFI responses. RFI responses should be clearly marked proprietary information.</p>
<p>It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. If GSA decides to proceed with a new procurement or announcement, we will synopsize our intent on FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. It is the interested party's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>A conference call will be scheduled for 10:00 am CST, 2 March 2015 where subject matter experts will provide a summary of this RFI and to answer questions. All interested parties should request the conference line number from the point of contact below. Otherwise, all questions concerning this Request for Information should be submitted in writing and addressed to the contact below.&nbsp; Questions&nbsp;may be submitted up to the date and time&nbsp;for&nbsp;responses. &nbsp;Any E-mail correspondence should have the subject line: GSA-PBS-R7-2015-OMC-RFI&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR HQ), in support of the Naval Sea Systems Command, Program Executive Office, Submarines, Maritime Surveillance Systems Program Office, PMS 485, intends to issue a Full and Open Competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for the development of Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) passive acoustic linear arrays. Based on market research, the Government determined that there were no small businesses capable of producing the required arrays within the required time frame.
The SWSS arrays are surveillance sensors used as the primary sensing capability for SWSS units which are physically attached to the arrays.  Each SWSS unit is a stand-alone, battery powered system which will collect, process, analyze the data from the array and transmit undersea contact locating information to operational commanders.  They are designed to support the Navy's littoral undersea surveillance needs in detecting and reporting submarines.  Each SWSS array comprises the following sub-assemblies: one acoustic array (to include its leader cable and terminating connector); one array interface card (physically located inside the SWSS node bottle which includes its necessary connectors and bulkhead connector), and one array dispenser.
The proposed contract will be a single award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with an ordering period of five years that will allow for the development and production of a maximum of 75 SWSS passive acoustic linear arrays.  The development and production effort will be procured on a Firm- Fixed-Price (FFP) basis.
A Sources Sought, SPAWAR Headquarters MKTSVY F1ADA dated 24 June 2014, was issued for market research purposes to determine the interest and capability of Small Business to participate in this acquisition.  Of the four responses to the Sources Sought, three were from small businesses and one was from a non-profit organization.  The Government's analysis of the Sources Sought responses indicated that none of the four were capable of producing the required arrays within the required time frame.  Therefore, it was recommended that the SWSS Array RFP be issued as a Full and Open Competitive solicitation.  The SPAWAR Small Business Office and the Small Business Administration Representative reviewed the Sources Sought analysis and concurred with the decision not to set-aside this effort.
Responses to this announcement should be addressed to James Leal at James.Leal@navy.mil. Companies interested in this RFP should monitor the FedBizOpps.com website for the release of this solicitation.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award. <br>  <br> This is a non-personal services contract to provide Military Dashboard Design. The South Atlantic Charleston Dashboard (SACD) will transform the District's approach to executing construction and operations and maintenance projects to provide internal and external customers with a greater level of consistency and predictability in the delivery process. This dashboard will be adapted from the established and proven USACE Fort Worth District Medical Operations Performance Dashboard (SWFMOCD).

<DESC>United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) has a continuing need for Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP) services.&nbsp; Additional option periods are required on the existing Task Order to span the gap between the current contract ending 28 February 2015 and implementation of the new Under Secretary of Defense Policy (USD(P)) Mission Assurance policy.&nbsp; The new Mission Assurance policy is expected to be released sometime during the second or third quarter of&nbsp;FY 15 to establish DoD Mission Assurance responsibilities.&nbsp; Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP)&nbsp;under the Mission Assurance Strategy will expand to synchronize current responsibilities with the Antiterrorism; Cyber Security; Information Security; Physical Security; COOP; and CBRNE Programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Knowing that the responsibilities assigned to USTRANSCOM are changing with the Mission Assurance Policy, it is not possible to solicit for contract support until such time as the requirements are fully known.&nbsp; Adding two, six-month option periods (Option&nbsp;Period 3: 1 March 2015 - 31 August 2015 and Option Period 4: 1 September 2015 - 29 February 2016)&nbsp;to the existing task order allows for USTRANSCOM to compete full and open for this acquisition in the future&nbsp;and to continue to meet its established DCIP responsibilities&nbsp;as required by DoD Directives, Policy, and&nbsp;Instructions.&nbsp;
