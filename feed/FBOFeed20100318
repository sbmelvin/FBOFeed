<DESC>Electronic Systems Center (ESC) is seeking qualified sources to further develop and sustain the Global Adaptive Planning-Collaborative Information Environment (GAP-CIE) software application developed under the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) program.  GAP-CIE supports a new real-time, net-centric, crisis-planning capability that integrates operational information and creates an automated "Courses of Action" suite the National Command Authority (NCA) assesses to weigh appropriate responses.
GAP-CIE provides global planners (National, Strategic, and Operational levels) a doctrine based series of portal workspaces that are process-structured for data, information and services orchestration.  The planning workspaces support collaborative, web-based joint operation planning across security enclaves for rapid development and maintenance of "living plans", and when necessary, the dynamic transition of integrated courses of action (COAs) to execution.  Incremental modernization of this capability is necessary to provide additional COA development capabilities (Contingency and Crisis Action) and to scale the system for an expanding user base with emphasis on sustainability as an enterprise service that is federated, synchronized, and distributed for redundancy and reliability.

<SUBJECT>A -- GLOBAL HAWK MULTI-BAND RADOME ANALYSIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
<SOLNBR>R2357
<CONTACT>Bill Lyons kathleen.delgado@hanscom.af.mil

<a href="mailto:kathleen.delgado@hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>This is not a solicitation.  This synopsis is being issued to conduct market research for informational and planning purposes for the High Data Rate-Airborne Terminal (HDR-AT) Program.  The United States Air Force, Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom Air Force Base, 653 ELSW/SNND, is seeking responses from potential sources to perform the up-front technical analysis and testing necessary to develop an airborne satellite antenna radome capable of supporting both Ku commercial and Ka Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellite communication links.
Radome target radio frequency performance requirements include:Insertion Loss:    Commercial Ku TX:  <= 1 dB   WGS Ka TX:  <= 1 dB(Note:  For commercial Ku and WGS receive frequencies the insertion loss goal is <= 1 dB, however receive performance may be traded for improved transmit values)  Transmit Axial Ratio Degradation:   Ku:  <= 0.75 dB over 98.9% of pointing angles (3-sigma)   Ka:  <= 0.5 dB over 50% of pointing angles and <= 1 dB over 98.9% of pointing angles(Note:  For receive frequencies the axial ratio goal is as for transmit, but receive performance may be traded in favor of transmit axial ratio)
Radome Induced Boresight and Differential Boresight (TX to RX Misalignment) Error:   Ka:  <= 0.04 degrees over 98.9% of pointing angles   Ku:  <= 0.08 degrees over 98.9% of pointing angles
Sidelobe degradation   Radome effects shall not cause antenna sidelobes degradation greater than 2dB This new multi-band radome must meet all of the environmental performance specifications of the current Global Hawk radome.  Of significant concern to the Government is maintaining the current radome shape to avoid/limit potential airworthiness recertification actions.  This analysis effort will culminate in the testing of a small sample of the radome material produced to test limited functionality against environmental and electrical requirements.  Estimated period of performance would be nine (9) months after contract award.  The Air Force is seeking firms who believe they are qualified to conduct this effort.  
Firms who respond to this sources sought synopsis must provide detailed information demonstrating their capabilities in  the following areas: (1) Knowledge of/experience with developing and producing multi-band, low loss radomes for aircraft; (2) Discussion of available company organic hardware & software capabilities to enable analysis, design, production, and testing to support such an effort; (3) Experienced technical personnel available to perform this effort; (4) Your approach to successfully complete this effort within the estimated period of performance; (5) Any data rights assertions that you might already maintain that would relate to such an effort and how it might affect performance of the efforts; (6)  What data you would expect as Government Furnished Information (GFI) to complete this effort ; and (7) The accuracy of effort results should the GFI could not be furnished. Responses are limited to no more than 20 double-spaced, single-sided pages.  Firms who submit responses to this notice are requested to identify prior contracts (by contract number and issuing office) and Government points of contact (preferably the buyer or contracting officer) where they have provided similar types of efforts.  
Interested firms should submit their written and electronic responses to the contracting officer, Ms. Kathleen N. Delgado, 653 ELSW/SNND PK, 5 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2100, (781) 271-5133, mailto:kathleen.delgado@hanscom.af.mil.  Responses must be received no later than fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this announcement.
This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice nor will it reimburse firms for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.   We remind companies interested in pursuing this opportunity in any prime, subcontractor, or teaming arrangement capacity of their responsibility to plan for and address potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues.  This is especially important if a company is presently supporting the Government through an Advisory and Assistance Services contract.  Guidance is found in FAR Part 9 - Contractor Qualifications, and possibly OCI clauses in other Government contracts your company may have.  Companies should contact kathleen.delgado@hanscom.af.mil with any questions you may have on this matter.

<DESC>EMDS is an Army enterprise application that is used to automate the Force Management Office Force Validation Committee (FVC) process.  The FVC is an element of DAMO-FM, which conducts a cross-functional assessment of select Army units on a monthly basis.  This assessment offers current and predictive analysis based on authoritative sources of information for personnel, equipment, training, and stationing readiness at all levels.  The EMDS enterprise application allows the FVC to review more units in a shorter period of time, which allows for more timely information to be presented before the Vice Chief of Staff Army (VCSA) at the monthly Army Synchronization Meeting (ASM).  Additionally, EMDS provides a common operating picture of Army units before deployment, thereby increasing the likelihood of accuracy of unit readiness assessments.<BR>POC: Calvin Artis / calvin.artis1@conus.army.mil

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center (JM&L CC) Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806 - 5000, on behalf of the, Munitions Engineering Technology Center, Medium and Cannon-Caliber Munitions Division, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, has a need for the development and demonstration of technologies that will bridge the gap between the current Counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM) capability and the future Objective Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) capability for providing mobile, 360 degree hemispherical extended area protection from RAM threats.  These technologies are to be demonstrated as part of ARDECs four-year Extended Area Protection and Survivability (EAPS) Integrated Demonstration (ID) Army Technology Objective (ATO) Program.  ARDEC's desire is to develop technologies that support a ground-mounted air-defense gun system to provide both wide-area protection and protection to specific high valued assets on the battlefield.  This pre-solicitation notice is in anticipation of an RFP whose scope is to further advance a rudimentary fire control sensor tracking system that was successfully demonstrated to command-divert and command-detonate outgoing single 50mm interceptors during the previous demonstration phase of the EAPS ATO.   The objective of the EAPS ID ATO phase is to demonstrate a more mature and sophisticated Fire control sensor and Fire Control and Radio Frequency (RF) suite capable of providing command functions to optimized 50mm interceptor ammunition.  This sensor Suite must provide the following functions; a search mode capable of detecting RAM type targets in a single quadrant, tracking of multiple threats and 50mm interceptors simultaneously, and command communication functionality and a telemetry link to the outgoing interceptors.  This will require the development of the command functions to support the necessary communication data-link with the Fire Control Sensor to the outgoing interceptors as well as the Fire Control software algorithms using the fire control sensor data to implement objectives of the EAPS ATO-ID program.  ARDEC-Picatinny intends to satisfy this requirement by awarding a Classified Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type Contract for a period of performance of thirty seven (37) months (FY10-FY13) through full and open competition.  This contract will be incrementally funded each year.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available electronically at the following Internet address: http://procnet.pica.army.mil &  https://www.fbo.gov/  on or about 15 days from the date of this announcement. The USG has available documents supporting  the RFP that are essential to the bidder in providing an accurate and complete proposal while minimizing questions and clarifications.  These documents have various distribution levels, ranging from FOUO to SECRET.  Documents supporting the RFP are available from the point of contact listed in the RFP by request upon successful validation of appropriate facility and personnel clearances and the bidders certification as an approved Department of Defense Contractor (Distribution D).   Points of contacts for this requirement are Mr. Gherin Fracasso, Contracts Specialist, gherin.fracasso@us.army.mil, and Mr. Timothy Jensen, Contracting Officer, tim.jensen@us.army.mil.  Proposals will be required on or before 12:00 pm EDT 17 May 2010 to: JM&L CC, Attn: CCJM-JA, Gherin Fracasso, Bldg 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO EXECUTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS, LLC UNDER GSA CONTRACT GS-35F-0170K/ED-OIG-09-O-0070.<br />&nbsp;
<p>In September 2008, the U.S. Department of Education, Office of the Secretary, Risk Management Services (RMS) awarded a contract to Executive Information Systems, LLC for the procurement of SAS business intelligence and statistical analysis software tools and support services to assist RMS in determining potential risk with the ED grantee and grant portfolio as part of the ERM analysis activities. SAS services have assisted the RMS and the OIG in creating and implementing a robust system to enhance monitoring by allowing data-driven decisions and creating complex applications using the aforementioned statistical analysis software tools. The RMS system, the Decision Support System (DSS), analyzes important financial management information, including audit findings, excessive drawdown reports, financial health indicators, and internal controls compliance. In formulating risk reports, this data derives from existing data sources as input (Grants Application Processing System (GAPS), Federal Audit Clearinghouse, Audit Accountability and Resolution Tracking System, EDFacts, and proprietary data acquired from Dun &amp; Bradstreet).</p>
<p>The DSS resides on the OIG Data Analytics System (ODAS), an intelligent data warehouse that provides proactive data mining capabilities and identifies internal control issues within ED and Federal Student Aid (FSA) systems. ODAS is housed in the OIG's Information Technology Audits and Computer Crime Investigations (ITACCI) lab and is connected to an independent network separate of ED's operating environment.</p>
<p>Further work on the DSS requires the usage of the SAS AppDev Studio's advanced development environment which leverages a tightly coupled connection to the SAS ODAS backend infrastructure and the JBoss application server, which is where the SAS Portal resides.</p>
<p>The Department expects to obtain this software by issuing a firm fixed price Delivery Order under GSA Contract GS-35F-0170K/ED-OIG-09-O-0070 with Executive Information Systems, LLC.</p>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of transceivers for previously acquired HP servers. These previously acquired HP servers will be used to establish a new Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), and Firewall infrastructure at ESOC East.  The infrastructure is a replication of the existing infrastructure currently in place at the Harry S Truman Building (HST). This purchase is for transceivers  cable/fiber conversion components  that are integral to a $2.5 million dollar blade server system previously purchased. The original order did not include this component. This was an oversight. The component is proprietary. The transceivers will only be plugged into these previously acquired HP servers. It should have been included in the original system purchase. It is not an open market item.
These previously acquired HP servers were one acquisition of several to establish the PKI/DMZ/Firewall architecture at ESOC East. The architecture will be a replica of the PKI/DMZ/Firewall architecture currently in place at HST.  It will use the same suite of products in use at HST to ensure compatibility across enclaves and to maintain consistency across sites to ensure the ability to centrally support the customer lights-out ESOCs.  This is in full compliance with our FISMA reporting responsibilities and the Presidents Management Agenda.<BR><BR>41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Paragraph (c) provides for use of a brand name procurement.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as key components of the Departments PKI / DMZ / Firewall infrastructure.  This purchase is one of several to replicate the Departments existing PKI / DMZ / Firewall infrastructure.  Question 3 above addresses the historical background of this issue more fully.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The FAA intends to issue a modification to a competitively awarded Contract that was issued in 2008 to IOWA State University.  The purpose of the Modification is to expand the scope of the contract to include developing a public domain, industrial specification which describes the ultrasonic inspection processes used for typical engine disk geometries.  These inspection processes were used to generate Probability Of Detection (POD) curves under the original contract.  The FAA believes it to be in their best interest to issue a modification to the current contract as it would be too costly to go out for a separate, competitive procurement for the policy development.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This opportunity is only available to the contractor(s) who were awarded the contract(s) for work in response to Solicitation No. AG-04R3-S-09-8113, COLLABORATIVE RESTORATION STEWARDSHIP, ON THE UMATILLA, WALLOWA-WHITMAN, MALHEUR AND OCHOCO NATIONAL FOREST. The original solicitation was competitively advertised as a Commercial Items RFP. The Government intends to award multiple Delivery Orders from a single request for quotations.  This project will be partially or wholly funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds and is subject to all reporting requirements thereto. 


The Collaborative Restoration Stewardship contract is an integrated resource contract that includes ground-based logging, cable logging, and product transportation as well as slash treatment.  The issuance of these Delivery Orders require the contractor(s) to reduce the potential of high intensity wildfire by removing or rearranging the existing fuel loading on the forest floor.  This particular project title is Gold Stew TO 1, which is located in the Silvies Project Area, on the Malheur National Forest.  All biomass removed will remain the property of the US Government and be transported by service contractor to local processors. This work will result in retaining healthy, vigorous understory trees at an average spacing of 20 feet to improve tree conditions and forest health, reduce ladder fuels located beneath overstory trees to reduce individual tree torching potential, provide a fuel loading profile that promotes defensible space for fire suppression, and for the re-introduction of fire in the project area. Fuel loading objectives relate to the remaining tons/acre and size of material left after treatment. Target fuel loading objective is to have no more than 5 to 10 tons per acre left once the work is completed. Slash treatment where required will be accomplished using mechanized equipment to masticate (chip) the slash. 


This project requires removal of approximately 2,320 tons of non-saw material (merchantable woody biomass). 


The resultant Task Order contract(s) will be a firm-fixed price, with requirements for biomass removal.

<DESC>The mission of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), DCTD, NCI centers on the discovery and preclinical development of agents with clinical anticancer potential. Preclinical pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies are an early and integral part of the overall drug development process and contract resources for preclinical development studies have existed in DTP continuously since the late 1970s. Characterization of the pharmacokinetics of new compounds provides important information for the selection of optimal drug development candidates and for the design and interpretation of preclinical efficacy studies, including the selection of formulations, routes, and schedules of administration. Moreover, one objective of preclinical toxicology evaluations is the correlation of toxic effects of a compound with plasma concentrations and/or area under the curve (AUC). The successful outcome of these studies thus depends heavily on the availability of sensitive methods for quantifying compounds in biological fluids and the careful integration of preclinical pharmacology and toxicology data.<br /><br /><br />Project Requirements<br /><br />Activities of any contract awarded from the proposed solicitation will include, but not be limited to, the following tasks:
<p>(1) Development of sensitive analytical methods to quantify compounds in plasma, urine, tissues, and other biological matrices;</p>
<p>(2) Plasma stability and protein binding studies, which are conducted at an early stage of compound development to ensure proper sample handling and to aid in the interpretation of in vivo studies;</p>
<p>(3) Pharmacokinetic evaluation of test compounds following administration to animals by various routes and schedules, including a determination of bioavailability by various routes;</p>
<p>(4) Quantification and identification of drug metabolites generated in vivo and in various in vitro systems (S9 fractions,<br /><br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will consist of five (5) years, from December 15, 2010 through December 14, 2015.</p>

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Sociometrics Corporation, 170 State Street, Suite 260, Los Altos, CA) for the continued operation of the Teen Age Pregnancy Prevention Database.
The NICHD intends to negotiate a one year contract with four option years with Sociometrics Corporation for the continued operation of the Teen Age Pregnancy Prevention Database.
Sociometrics was established in 1983 and has been managing the database under contract since that time. The proposed new contract will permit the continued operation and management of the database as a publicly-accessible repository for social science data on the incidence, prevalence, antecedents and consequences of teenage pregnancy and family planning. 
In 1994, the scope of Data Archive on Adolescent Pregnancy and Pregnancy Prevention (DAAPPP) was expanded to include studies that focus more broadly on adolescent sexual health issues, thereby including studies examining behavioral factors related to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in addition to pregnancy. 
Sociometrics Corporation shall continue furnishing all necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and processes to continue operating the database. Sociometrics Corporation  acquires datasets from  investigators, prepares the investigators datasets in a common format, and makes the datasets available, for a modest fee, through their  website.  To evaluate and to select data sets, the following explicit criteria are used: scientific significance; policy and program importance; validity and reliability of data and ability to generalize and the feasibility of acquisition of the data set. 
In order to perform the continued work, a new prospective contractor would need to develop or have an operational database and software that functions as a conduit for researchers to access research data utilizing user-friendly tools that allow researchers and program staff to run target queries.  Additionally, a new prospective contractor must have demonstrated successful professional relationships with researchers as well as demonstrated successful marketing strategies and networks in order to publicize the availability of the data to researchers and government agencies in order to maximize this valuable resource.   
Pursuant to 41 U.S.C 253 (c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, Sociometrics Corporation is the only source capable of continuing these services without substantial duplication of cost to the Government, as well as unacceptable delays and loss of consistency make competition unfeasible for the continuation of this project. Interested parties may submit their interest and corporate capability statements in response to the requirements as described above in writing. This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor is an RFP currently available. All interested parties may submit their statements to the point of contact below to the contracting office address no later than Friday, April 2, 2010 3 p.m. E.S.T. See numbered Note 22.

NO COLLECT CALLS OR FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION WILL BE ACCEPTED.  RESPONDENTS MAY SUBMIT THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS VIA E-MAIL IN ADDITION TO 3 HARD COPIES.  

Capability statements should be sent to:

Inspections shall be performed in accordance with PACP standards including the specific date and time of inspection.
The solicitation will include an Additive bid item to clean and TV an additional 2,100 LF of wastewater mains located at Manzanita Lake Campground area, and will be subject to the availability of funding at the time of award.  This area contains 4 Campground Loops with 5 Comfort Stations and one Camper Service Store with showers. Most of the sewer lines were installed in the 1950' and 1960's.  Some sections have been repaired with PVC or Cast Iron Pipe.  Some of these mains were slip-lined in the early 1990's.  Original pipe types are Ductile Iron, and Cast Iron.  Size range is 6" to 8".  The project range is estimated to be between $100,000 and $250,000.  Project completion is expected within 30 days of receipt of a Notice to Proceed.

<DESC>The work of this project requires the Contractor to provide all labor, supervision, materials, and equipment as needed to replace the roof (approx 4,400 SF) and repair the west porch structure of the Point Reyes Hostel main lodging facility located within Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, CA.  The roof has exceeded its useful life and must be replaced, and the front porch structure and railing have failed.  Several construction methods have been used to construct the roof as additions were added to the structures over the years.  Asbestos shingles cover 80 percent of the roof.  Smaller areas are constructed of composition shingles and built-up tar and gravel.  The project will replace the deteriorated roof with a standing seam steel roof chosen for its environmental friendliness and to support a future project construction of a photovoltaic array. Rain gutters and downspouts will be installed to direct the runoff to areas chosen to reduce erosion.  The asbestos material removed shall be properly disposed of by the contractor and appropriate documentation provided to the National Park Service.  The front entrance covered porch has damage to the structural members and deck structure.  The substructure components of the porch will be repaired in the project.
The project range is estimated to be between $100,000 and $250,000.  Project completion is expected within 60 days of receipt of a Notice to Proceed.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, anticipates award of a service contract that will cover FY10 - FY11 service requirements related to US Navy submarine storage batteries.  This will be a sole source procurement to EnerSys Technology, Warrensburg, MO based on FAR 6.302-1, only one source capable of meeting the Government's requirements.  A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  Requirements covered will be field and maintenance services for EnerSys main storage batteries on submarines that are in service (i.e., not under construction).  The Navy is in the process of transitioning from the flooded lead acid batteries to Valve-Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA batteries); installation of batteries are beginning to shift away from flooded lead acid to VRLA batteries.  As part of the field services effort the contractor is required to make routine visits at least once a year to each submarine as authorized by the Government, and make emergency visits as authorized.  The maintenance portion of the effort requires the contractor to have a complete maintenance program for all batteries on submarines.  Requirements specific to battery type require assistance in the planning, installation, testing, checkout, adjustment, disassembly and repair of submarine battery cells; and performance of on-the-job instruction and training of Navy personnel (military and/or civilian).  It is estimated that 2.0 man-years per year will be necessary to complete the requirements.  The applicable NAICS classification is 541330.  A Confidential Security Clearance is required.  Interested parties may submit inquiries or request a copy of the solicitation by sending an email to lorna.tribby@navy.mil.  The solicitation will be available on or about 30 July 2009 via the Internet at the NSWC Crane Homepage at http://www.crane.navy.mil and will close on or about 31 August 2009.  Point of contact is Mrs. Lorna Tribby, Code 0564EQ, telephone 812-854-6021, fax 812-854-3465, or email lorna.tribby@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source contract to Northrop Grumman Sperry Marine Division of Charlottesville VA for procurement of the following items:  seventeen (17) each LCAC Navigation Processing Unit Scan Converter Cards P/N 4801034 and  one (1) each  Bridgemaster E radar system consisting of  one (1) each Antenna Array P/N 65604/A/X; one (1) each Electronics Unit P/N 65800ZARR; one (1) each Turning Unit P/N 65825LAR/X; and one (1) each Radar Serial Interface Unit P/N 65847A. This acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: NAVSEA has conducted an extensive qualification program for manufacturers of scan converter cards and LCAC radar systems and has determined that it is necessary to purchase the same radars for the Non-SLEP craft as the SLEP craft. Currently the scan converter cards and Bridgemaster E radar system, originally manufactured by Sperry Marine, has been installed on all completed SLEP LCACs and has been on installed on some of the non-SLEP LCACs. These items, as previously installed, are integrated into the SLEP navigation hardware and software that will form the basis for the NDI replacement gear. Any other items would require extensive re-development, testing and qualification costs, and duplicating the logistics train established for the SLEP LCACs. Sperry Marine, as the OEM, is the only known source for this equipment. Therefore, there are no other sources that can satisfy this requirement. Offerors wishing to qualify items for future procurements may find out about the process for qualification by contacting Ivan Velazquez-Padilla at 850-235-5833, ivan.velazquez-padilla@navy.mil . Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  Required delivery is (22) weeks from issuance of the contract.  NAICS 334511 applies. FSC 5840.  Electronic quotes are encouraged.  The award will be based on a fair and reasonable price on or about 22 Jun 2010.  POINT OF CONTACT Code B32/Nicole Anderson, 110 Vernon Avenue, Bldg. 435, Panama City, FL 32407.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis a requirement for one (1) year of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services in support of the Forces Surveillance Support Center (FSSC) Relocatable Over the Horizon Radar (ROTHR) Systems.  The ROTHR System is a radar system that detects and tracks drug trafficking activities in Northern South American and Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico basins.  It is used by the Navy, North American Defense (NORAD), Customs, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and other national security agencies.  ROTHR Systems are located in Virginia, Texas, and Puerto Rico.  The Contractor shall operate, maintain, and support the ROTHR Systems 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Additionally, the effort includes systems engineering, engineering change proposal preparation and analysis, failure analysis, configuration management, preparation, installation and testing of field change kits, logistics support, training, and repair and refurbishment services.  This requirement presents several challenges to the Contractor including having to work with a mature system, dealing with parts obsolescence, and the Government does not possess the Level III technical data associated with this unique legacy system.
Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) of Reston, VA is currently providing the required services under Contract Number N00140-05-C-0015, which is scheduled to conclude on 31 July 2010.  While the Government is currently preparing for a long-term competitive procurement of the required services, a Bridge Contract with incumbent contractor RTSC is in the best interest of the Government to avoid a break in services.  This 1-year procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate directly with RTSC for this 1 year effort to cover a period of performance of 1 August 2010 through 31 July 2011.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:Darren.Shaffer@volpe.dot.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, a contract with the Harvard Medical School (HMS), Division of Sleep Medicine (DSM).  The contract will require the contractor to develop a multi-media web-based education program to provide Class 1, 2, and 3 railroad employees with a scientifically valid way to assess personal risk for prevalent sleep disorders as potentially related to the shiftwork schedules of railroad industry employees, and educational resources and accessible information regarding sleep science, sleep health, fatigue and fatigue management. This program shall be developed from currently available web-based applications, specifically, a proven screening tool for sleep disorders in shiftworkers. The goal is to produce a web-based educational program that draws in the target user, and provides him/her with easy-to-understand, scientifically credible information. This program requires the incorporation of an existing web-based sleep disorders screening tool for shiftworkers, which can be adapted to provide a rail context. The screening tool must (1) be web-based; (2) screen for multiple sleep disorders: insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and restless leg syndrome (RLS), in addition to narcolepsy with cataplexy and shift work sleep disorder (SWSD), and restless leg syndrome (RLS); (3) be validated as demonstrated by previous, successful development and implementation in another shiftworker population, in order to ensure that it is appropriate for adaptation to shiftworking railroad employees. Proof of validation must exist in the form of published, scientific study findings regarding data obtained through administering the screening tool, and be presented in one or more peer-reviewed, scientific journals; and (4) the data collected using the sleep disorders screening tool must be maintained and utilize appropriate safeguards of personal and sensitive information as provided over the web in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and other such standards. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 611710 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million. This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested firms must submit, to the above named point of contact, a maximum of three, but not less than two pages addressing their capabilities, and providing clear and convincing evidence of the firm?s capability to meet the screening tool?s required criteria identified above.  Written capability statements must be submitted to be received no later than 4:30 pm E.S.T January 15, 2008.  This proposed action is for research and development for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority in FAR 6.302-1.  All responses to this Notice, including Statements of Capabilities, must be in writing, and may be transmitted by either postal or electronic mail. All responses must be sent to Darren Shaffer, Contract Specialist, United States Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02142-1093.

Responses received after fifteen (15) calendar days from the synopsis date or without the required documentation will be considered non-responsive and will not be considered.  Such documentation will be utilized solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  The Government will not pay for any documentation provided in response to this synopsis and documentation received will not be returned to the sender.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources for Whole Body Imager (WBI) systems for screening of passengers to be used in our Nations airports. The TSA will examine each Offerors response to this announcement to determine those vendors who have satisfactorily met the minimum requirements as specified in the white paper requirements section of this announcement. The TSA intends to establish a Qualified Product List (QPL) based on the overall performance of each Offerors WBI against TSA specifications and reasonableness of price.  Only Offerors who respond to this announcement and demonstrate compliance to TSAs requirements, as specified in the TSA WBI Procurement Specification, dated May 2008, will be eligible for placement onto the QPL.  This will be an open QPL, meaning that the Offeror will be able to submit white papers to the contracting officer at any time, although testing will only occur at the discretion of the TSA.  If initial testing finds that the product fails to meet the basic requirements, a vendor will not be permitted to retest sooner than 30 business days after the failure, unless it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  If the product fails a second test, the product will be locked out of future testing for six months, unless the Government determines it is in TSAs best interest to allow further testing.  Only Offerors who successfully complete testing will be placed on the QPL and be considered for a contract award.

Requirements for the WBI system have been broken into four tiers with progressively increasing levels of requirements.  The vendor has the choice to meet the requirements of the different tiers.  To be added to the QPL, each vendor must meet all Tier I requirements.  A higher-level system must meet all the requirements of the tiers below it.  For example, a Tier III system must meet all Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III requirements.  Potential examples of Tier I requirements include Security Technology Interface Program (STIP), privacy filters, and the ability to scan an individual in the 95th percentile for height.  The tier structure primarily reflects progressively increased requirements for performance to potentially include multiplexing and explosives detection. (see attachments for full announcement)

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Engineering Service Division (ESD), Elizabeth City, NC, intends to competitively acquire engineering processes, technical and training support for the Coast Guard's logistics transformation effort and to sustain current users of the Asset Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS). Requirements exist for support services in the following locations: Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Elizabeth City, NC, Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC) Baltimore, MD, and the Aviation Training Center (ATC) in Mobile, AL.
<p>Asset Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS) has long been employed by Coast Guard Air Stations as a means to track maintenance actions and operational data of Coast Guard aircraft; specifically the Electronic Asset Logbook (EAL) and Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) functions of the system. EAL and ACMS programs are vital to the logistical support of Coast Guard assets by; tracking usage rates, documenting scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, ensuring asset configuration integrity, and documenting operational data. Based upon the success of the system, the Logistics Transformation Program Integration Office (LTPIO) will be expanding the use of ALMIS to include all assets in the Coast Guard. The Decision Support System (DSS) is a module in ALMIS that provides; integrated help, web reports and Power Play Cubes. A cube is a file that is created by aggregating data along a number of dimensions and storing it in such a way that it can be accessed quickly. All the dimensions in this cube can be accessed and changed in a rapid manner. The data might be operational hours including dimensions such as time, unit, and asset number. Coast Guard active duty, government employees and some contractors located at Coast Guard Headquarter\Areas\Districts\Air Stations\Sectors\Groups\Units and Cutters must be trained to gain the ability to perform operational and maintenance data entry and analysis using ALMIS. IMPROTANT: The Coast Guard is not entertaining new software and/or hardware configuration. The anticipated release date for the Request for Proposed (RFP), HSCG38-10-R-500004 will be on or about the 04 January 2010 with an anticipated closing date and time for submission 03 February 2010 at 2:00 P.M. local time. The solicitation and all corresponding documents will be available at the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. An award of a firm-fixed price IDIQ competitive contract to the offeror whose conformance to the RFP will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered is anticipated. The Government intends to make a single award. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 518210, which has a small business size standard of $25M annual revenue. This is a 100% Small Business set-aside. Only small businesses will be considered for award. The period of performance will be for a total of 3 years consisting of a one year-base period (01 April 2010 through 31 March 2011) followed two one-year option periods. Requests for a copy of the RFP shall be in writing and mailed to the following address or you may correspond via e-mail to: Lucille.McEachin@uscg.mil. Offeror's shall include solicitation number, business name and full address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, facsimile number, and cage code. Requests are to be submitted to: USCG, Aviation Logistics Center, ESD Procurement, Building 78, Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001, Attn: Mrs. Lucille McEachin. No telephone inquiries will b accepted.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding a requirement to provide follow-on non-contractor logistics support for the LTPS Advanced Targeting Pods (ATP) currently integrated on the following platforms:  F-15E, F-16 (all Blocks), B-52, and A-10.  In the future, the LTPS may continue to be integrated onto additional airframes.  The USAF proposes to establish an LTPS Post Production Support (PPS) contract as early as 1 March 2011 to provide ATP users with support in the areas of:  hardware and software upgrades to fielded systems, potential upgrade of fielded LTPSs to future Advanced Targeting Pod-Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) configurations, source documentation and technical data maintenance, flight test support, studies, demonstrations, and pod/host platform integration support.  The LTPS PPS program's key acquisition objectives are to:  1)   maintain or improve the current level of support to the LTPS ATP host platforms and operating locations! , 2)  maintain compliance with DoD policy requirements-to include Unique Item Identification (UID) and Operational, Safety, Suitability, & Effectiveness (OSS&E) tracking, and 3)  manage obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  The Government contemplates that PPS requirements will be addressed via a five-year Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with possible extension, as a follow-on to current LTPS ID/IQ contracts with Northrop Grumman System Corporation (i.e., the Original Equipment Manufacturer and prime contractor).  The sponsoring activity is the 647th Aeronautical Systems Squadron, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  Sources responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business,!  a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business, or a minority institution.  This effort is open to US bidders only.  The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code is 336413.  Interested sources shall register as a source on the PIXS website (https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources must also respond with a complete capability/qualification package describing their technical expertise and experience, personnel and facilities.  The package is limited to 10 pages, with standard font sizes and margins.  Information can include means in which the USAF can foster competition among venders for this effort.  The response should also identify technical risks, issues and any partnering arrangements that may be considered.  Please provide a telephone number, an email address, and a facsimile number in the response.  Information marked as "Proprietary" will be protected and will not be divulged unless mandated by existing laws.  This information should be sent to 647 AESS/PK, 2145 Monahan Way, Wright-Patterson, AFB OH 45433-7017 no!  later than fifteen (15) days from the publication of this notice.  The point of contact is Mr. Daniel R. Demaree, (937) 255-7979, email daniel.demaree@wpafb.af.mil.  Any non-technical and/or contractual questions should be referred to the above individual.

Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.

This new capability would serve as a comprehensive training platform applicable and available to any of our 12,450 4N0X1s regardless of the individual's training, experience, or location around the globe. MTF's would no longer need to develop a local training program, which is the standard of practice today, representing countless man-hours to develop and administer. The driver for this requirement is to create a standardized training platform designed to reduce medicolegal vulnerabilities and establish a measurable end product line that we as an AFMS can stand behind. Providing a common training platform in this core competency bridges the gap between the experience and competency throughout the medical technician's lifecycle and skill level while reinforcing key fundamentals and principles the AFMS feels relevant in rendering safe and effective health care.</p>

<SUBJECT>Architecture & Engineering Services for the Building 1 Renovation Project
<SOLNBR>NB194000-A-02654
<RESPDATE>040210
<CONTACT>Jason Gerloff, Contract Specialist, Phone 3034976320, Email jgerloff@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on Small Businesses that are capable of providing Architecture and Engineering Services for the renovation project of Building 1 in Boulder, Colorado. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This notice is not a request for proposal. A solicitation is not available at this time.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of the sources sought. The sources sought is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for quotes and proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for/or award a competitive contract. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FEDBIZOPPS. It is the potential sources responsibility to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS site for release of any solicitation or synopsis resulting from this announcement.<br /><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are completed for the renovation project that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a full and open competitive procurement and subsequently award a standalone contract. If the Government determines that enough qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside. Failure of small businesses to identify themselves at this time having the ability to act as the Lead Architect/Engineer will result in the solicitation being advertised full and open to both small and large business concerns.
<p>NIST has a need for a Lead Architect/Engineer for the Renovation of Building 1, a cast-in-place reinforced concrete building that would meet the following requirements. Provide pre-construction services to include detailed cost estimating of a $40 - $60 million construction contract for the Building 1 Renovation on a federal campus. In addition to cost estimating, the selected A/E shall provide constructability reviews, value engineering recommendations, provide design reviews at the various design submittal stages for two years. Due to the size of the project, the Architectural-Engineering (A-E) firm's contract with NIST is projected to range from $3.5 to $4.5 million dollars for design services to include all architecture, engineering, hazardous material/soil testing, inspections, laboratory de-commissioning standards, survey work, coordination with multiple federal, state, and local agencies and municipalities. The A-E shall have past experience in the same scale of renovation projects and provide sufficient references for successful project completions of multiple projects ranging between $40 and $60 million. The A-E shall be familiar with the use of Integrated Project Delivery through the use of Building Information Modeling which will benefit the government during the entire life cycle of the building. This experience shall include renovations of occupied space including but not limited to Domestic Water, Fire Suppression Water, Sanitary Sewer, Storm Water, High Voltage Electrical, Telecommunications, and Security. The A-E shall be familiar with hazardous material removal methods including removal and containment that meets both the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Colorado's Department of Environmental Health Protection Division. <br />Renovated spaces shall be sufficient to support NIST's vision well into the 21st Century and will be supportive of infrastructure recently developed on site. The finished environment shall be supportive of internal collaboration and informal interaction and shall be energy efficient. The complexity of the program is evident from the numerous and diverse research divisions and support organizations located on the campus.<br />The A-E shall provide documentation, including references, of projects like-in-kind to the proposed Building 1 Renovation project. The A-E shall be responsible for a complex communication plan to include customer internet accessibility, traffic control, coordination efforts for outages of the federal building and 3 federal agencies. The A-E shall be responsible for coordinating with the federal and state health agencies listed above in addition to potentially the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort as 541330, and the small business size standard is $4.5 million.</p>
<p>After a determination is made on a small business set aside or open to all business concerns, the Building 1 Renovation solicitation will be announced and procured under the Brooks A/E Act and FAR Part 36. The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants during the selection process. This is not a Request for Proposals.</p>
<p>All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) prior to any award. To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 800-333-0505 or on line at <br />https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html.</p>

<p>Title: Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome Support Services Contract</p>
<p>This is a Small Businesses Sources Sought notice (SS).  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this project is 541990.</p>
<p>The small business size standard is $7M.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG's) research focuses on discovering genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and identifying new approaches to cancer prevention.  This project is for the re-competition of contract N02-CP-65501 with Westat, Inc., which was awarded on a competitive basis for a five year period.  This Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of NCI.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this support will be to provide support services for the Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes (IBMFS) Program which involves large numbers of families in which there is proband with a cancer-prone IBMFS, and includes both family studies at the NIH Cancer Center and field studies of members of large families.  The NCI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small businesses concerns in performing the tasks/duties herein.  Based on the responses received from this SBSS notice, the proposed project may be solicited as a Small Business Set-Aside.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice or the NCI's  use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The project will require a contractor to provide support services for the Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Program within the Clinical Genetics Branch, Human Genetics Program, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute.  The IBMFS Program encompasses several rare, well-characterized bone marrow disorders, each with a high degree of neoplasia.  It involves large numbers of families in which there is a proband with a cancer-prone IBMSF, and includes both family studies at the NIH Clinical Center and field studies of members of large families.  The Contractor shall perform some or all of the following activities as may be specified by the NCI Project Officer in the conduct of each study.</p>
<p>A.   Study Initiation and Liaison</p>
<p>1.	Determine parties whose cooperation and approval is necessary for implementation of the study (e.g., federal or state agencies, universities, hospitals, medical offices, laboratories, other NCI Contractors, etc.).</p>

<p>8.	Assist in the development of protocols and completion of forms as may be required for various committees, such as Institutional Review Boards. Attend such committee meetings if requested by the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR).</p>
<p><br />B.  Development of Study Materials and Procedures</p>
<p>9.	Prepare, pretest, and produce data collection forms (e.g., abstract forms, follow-up forms, coding forms, questionnaires and exposure assessment forms, biospecimen collection and processing forms, tracking forms, etc.). Questionnaires may be either paper or computer-assisted.</p>
<p>10.	Prepare training programs and materials for abstractors, interviewers and other study personnel. Conduct training for new staff in a timely manner and update training for all staff as needed, but not less than annually.</p>
<p>11.	Prepare procedure manuals for nurses, genetic counselors, research assistants, phlebotomists, abstractors, coders, interviewers, tracers, supervisors, data editors, and other personnel as needed.</p>
<p>12.	Prepare procedure manuals for the collection of biological specimens, shipment of biological specimens, submission of specimens to repositories, and tracking of specimens and laboratory results.</p>
<p>13.	Prepare manuals for obtaining and handling medical records, pathology specimens and reports, submission of pathology specimens for review, and collection of death certificates or cause of death. This includes coordinating systematic reviews and coding of reports or of surgical pathology specimens (i.e., central pathology review) by appropriate nosologists, clinicians or pathologists.</p>
<p>14.	Prepare and update manuals of usual operating procedures relative to evaluating, managing and coordinating follow-up of members of high risk families.</p>
<p>15.	Prepare nursing assessments and plans for clinical evaluation of individuals at high risk of cancer because of family history or specific exposures.</p>

Patients treated for an initial symptom who are being followed for the occurrence of cancers or other treatment related outcomes of interest.</p>
<p>23.	Trace study subjects and locate them or their next of kin for interview, examination and/or collection of study specific biological specimens.</p>
<p>24.	Maintain current contact information for study participants and their health care providers, updating existing computer records containing contact information in an ongoing fashion, and tracing selected family members who have been lost to follow-up.</p>
<p>D.   Interview and Abstracting Data Collection</p>
<p>25.	Obtain the necessary permissions/consents and then interview subjects or their family members using mail, telephone, or in person questionnaires. Verify a sample of completed questionnaires. Questionnaire content will be provided by the NCI COTR and will be jointly modified, if necessary.</p>
<p>26.	Abstract, photocopy, microfilm or computerize records (clinic or office medical records, hospital charts, vital records, job records, etc.). Maintain quality control over the abstracting or copying process. Verify the accuracy of an appropriately sized sample of abstracts (determined with the COTR) by independent re-abstracting. Accuracy is to be maintained at a 98% level.</p>
<p>27.	Procure death certificates from vital records departments. The Contractor shall be responsible for determining details of and payment for death certificate procurement. The Contractor shall also be responsible for complying with requirements regarding retention of such records in consultation with the COTR.</p>
<p>28.	Purchase other data, materials, and/or services as directed by the COTR.</p>
<p>29.	Validate exposure or disease histories obtained in interviews by obtaining copies of original records. This includes maintaining a management tracking system for the retrieval of such records.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), located in Gloucester, MA., intends to issue a fixed price purchase order for the design, testing and delivering of commercial fishing line radio frequency ( RFID)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>tags.</p>
<p>Fishing gear marking, a component of the ALWTRP,( Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan) is required for gear identification purposes if gear is recovered from an entangled animal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gear marking techniques are useful in determining, for example, if the gear was fished legally, the types of fisheries involved in entangling whales, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The goal of this project is to develop a type of tag that could be successfully deployed on fishing lines to help gather information on the origin and type of fishing gear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Understanding gear origin and type of gear can help guide management decisions and assist in disentanglement efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This " smart" tag must 1) be capable of being manufactured in multiple fluorescent colors, 2) contain a readable bar code utilizing a portable reading system, 3) be capable of sticking to both wet and dry line, and 4) be easily attached with a durability of at least one year of commercial fishing at sea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additional necessary characteristics of the tag include easy storage onboard vessels, low cost to purchase, and high visibility while hauling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It must contain bar code information that includes the type of gear, part of the gear it is attached to (e.g., buoy line, groundline), and origin of gear (state and owner). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The intent is that several RFID tags would be placed along the line between the surface system and gear on the ocean floor and also on lines between traps on the ocean floor. Lines have a range of between 5/16" to &frac34;" in diameter. Lines are often set in depths of up to 250 fathoms. Lines are at sea for several years so tags would need periodic replacement with a target of at least one year of operation<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The lines are used repeatedly over several years, but the tags would function a full year before replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to be submerged most of the year, the tag receives considerable abuse several times per week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tags are tossed around in both placement and retrieval.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On retrieval the line is wrapped a rotating V-pulley such that the bottom of the "V" has no width.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the line is wrapped, it is trapped in the "V" and pulled in with tensions in excess of 3000 lbs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is possible that the tag would be trapped in some way between the line and the V-pulley side applying great pressure on the IC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the tags extend out from the line like a flag<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>there is the potential they would be permanently crimped.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Introduction</strong><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Management of marine mammal populations falls within the jurisdiction of NOAA Fisheries' National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 and, for some species, under the Endangered Species Act (</span><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">ESA</span><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">) of 1973.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Section 118 of the MMPA directs NMFS to establish Take Reduction Teams (TRTs) to assist in the development of draft take reduction plans (TRPs) for strategic stocks of marine mammals that interact with a category I or II fishery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The long term goal of the take reduction planning process is reduce the mortality and serious injury of marine mammals to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate goal while taking into account the economics of the fishery, the availability of existing technology, and existing state or regional fishery management plans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Presently the NMFS Northeast Regional Office (NERO) has three active take reduction teams working to address the incidental serious injury and mortality of marine mammals associated with various commercial fishing activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (ALWTRT) was established to address serious injury and mortality of right, humpback, fin and minke whales in the several fixed-geared fisheries including the Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic lobster trap/pot fishery, the Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery, and the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the 2003 ALWTRT meeting, members agreed by consensus on two overarching principles for the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP): 1) reduce entanglement risks associated with groundlines (the lines that connect multiple traps/pots to each other in a trawl or, for gillnet gear, lines that connect an anchor or buoy line to a gillnet or gillnet bridle); and 2) reduce entanglement risks associated with vertical lines (buoy lines associated with trap/pot or gillnet gear).<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong>To address the entanglement risks associated with groundlines, NMFS, with input from the ALWTRT, has implemented a broad-based gear modification strategy that requires, amongst other measures, sinking groundline for trap/pot and gillnet gear (72 FR 57104, October 5, 2007; 73 FR 51228; September 2, 2008).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sinking groundlines reduce entanglement risk to large whales by sinking to the ocean bottom rather than arcing up into the water column.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A continuing concern in the evolution of the ALWTRP is the risk of entanglement in vertical line. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;Regarding entanglement risks with vertical lines, to better understand the vertical line entanglement risks, and potential biological and socioeconomic impacts of additional management measures intended to address them, NMFS is seeking additional information that can be ascertained from entanglements between commercial fishing gear and large whales.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At present, NMFS lacks very important gear characterization information that can be essential to management initiatives to further conserve large whale species.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>To achieve this information needed by NMFS, NMFS is seeking to explore a new technology to mark vertical lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The new technology is called Radio Frequency Identification (RFID).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The goal of this study is to develop a RFID tag, in consultation with the NMFS PRD Gear Research Team, which would be able to identify source of line recovered from entangled marine mammals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Line tagging concepts that have been experimented with, but not completed include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Injectable RFID - these units have been worked into the braids of the line and held in place by silicon caulk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This suffers from being very time consuming and spreads the braids of the line</li>
<li>A long narrow dipole is captured in smaller braided twine and then the twine is braided into the fishing line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This potentially increases the likelihood the IC will be crushed as well as the IC will be separated from the antenna by experiencing the tension and subsequent elongation of the fishing line.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>. Ideally tags would be able to stick to wet or dry line to accommodate line already in service.</p>
<p>The intent is to read the tags with a handheld reader, so 1-2 ft range is acceptable with a handheld reader.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Presently the quest to just be able to determine type of fisheries, location gear was originally set, where in the gear (buoy line or ground line) and owner of gear<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">.</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Test Protocols</span>:</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: none; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo4; ">Submersion Test - submerge so-called waterproof tags in a near ocean salinity water solution and test for RF function and observe for wick once a week for 13 wks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any tag that fails because of water migration fails that waterproofing approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Use 25 of each design approach.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">Abuse Test - pull fishing line with inlays attached under tension with a V-pulley using difference inlay design and orientations seeing if any naturally avoid V-pulley abuse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Run 25 of each design approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Simulate 100 "haul-ins".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read the inlay to identify damaged tags and plot the loss for each inlay attachment execution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Final Test- Build 25 of the proposed tape/inlay tags and attach to fishing line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Submerge in a similar salt water bath and pull through the V pulley once a day under tension for 3 weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Record and analyze any RFID read failures or permanent tag deformation.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Performance Period</strong>The performance period for this project is one year from the date of the contracts award.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>

<CONTACT>Chris Avery, Subcontract Staff Specialist, Phone 716-942-4587, Fax 716-942-2031, Email chris.avery@wves.org
<DESC><br />This is a sources sought procurement only. This is not a solicitation announcement. West Valley Environmental Services (WVES) as a prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Energy is seeking to pre-qualify potential construction subcontractors which have the capabilities and can provide the documentation as requested in the attached "Subcontractor Prequalification Requirements" document. There is no solicitation available at this time. However, upon review of the subcontractor prequalification requirements, WVES will make a determination if the information submitted meets the minimum technical qualifications specified and whether to include the organization in any future potential solicitations for the scope of work.
<p>Interested organizations are requested to submit their written Subcontractor Prequalification Requirements information by 5:00 pm on March 30, 2010 to the attention of the buyer at the place of contract performance. For any questions call Chris Avery at (716) 942-4587 or by email at chris.avery@wves.org.</p>
<p>General Overview</p>
<p>In order to control the further expansion of a Strontium -90 (Sr-90) groundwater contamination plume, at the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) located south of Buffalo, NY, West Valley Environmental Services (WVES) is planning to install an approximately 900' long by 3' wide by 25' deep Permeable Treatment Wall (PTW) in the North Plateau Area of the WVDP Site.</p>
<p>Work will be performed under and be paid for by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).</p>
<p>The PTW must be installed utilizing a one-pass trencher, such as one operated by DeWind One-pass Trenching Inc., which is capable of cutting and filling a trench approximately 3' in width and approximately25' in depth, and has a minimum operating turning radius of 50'. As the trench is being excavated, 14 x 40 mesh zeolite material (supplied by WVES in I ton Supersacks) will be simultaneously backfilled by the subcontractor into the excavation. Water must be used during the zeolite loading process to consolidate the material and provide hydrostatic equilibrium in the trench. Soil spoils from the process must be discharged away from the machine and collected in an EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) lined swale adjacent to the wall location.<br />The majority of the PTW will follow an existing unpaved road. The road elevation will need to be raised approximately 4 ~ in some areas with stone to facilitate trencher operations. Along the alignment, a lined soil catchment swale must be constructed. A new gravel access road will be built to support the installation operation. Trenching will occur through an area where strontium-90 (Sr-90) groundwater concentrations range from 1,000 to 35,000 p CiIl and soil concentrations range from non-detect to 400 pCi/g Sr-90; dose rates will be less than 10 mr/hr. The soil in the area of the PTW consists of native silty sand, and silty sand and gravel (S&amp;G). The S&amp;G overlies a denser, low permeability silty till.</p>
<p>Equipment decontamination may be required at the end of the project.</p>
<p>The subcontractor will be required to complete site specific health, safety and radiological training, and all personnel must pass a 9 panel drug test and health physical. The subcontractor's VVES-approved Project Manager and Safety Representative or Alternates will be required to be onsite during all work activities.</p>
<p>The Subcontractor's "Scope of Work" for installing the PTW includes providing all material (except zeolite), equipment, labor, and oversight necessary to:</p>
<p>1) Prepare the site for installation of the PTW to include:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Installation of an --800' long x 15' wide x 1' deep gravel access road<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Raising an existing roadway (-800' long x --15' wide), by&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; approximately&nbsp;&nbsp;4ft.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Constructing a soil catchment swale, parallel to and along the newPTW<br />2) Install the PTW using a continuous, one-pass trencher.<br />3) Collect trencher spoils in a lined soil catchment swale and covering and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sealing with EDPM</p>

The Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center (NOC), intends to award a call/task order against the competitively awarded Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for GCDB and Land Records Services to procure services for GCDB Conversion and Integration in Idaho.  The BPA being utilized is L10PA00578, and was awarded to Premier Data Services through GSA contract number GS-35F-0418K.

This opportunity is only available to the current BPA contract holder.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210.  Below is a general description of the services required.
The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey information and GPS positions to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) in support of parcel based recording, analysis and display of geographic information. This information is called the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB).  In Idaho there are three uncollected complex townships that are highly mineralized and contain numerous Mineral Surveys.  These townships also contain a proposed Energy Corridor and their collection is necessary in order to portray the PLSS.  The collection of GCDB Data in these townships is in support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) relative to land records cleanup for renewable energy projects (Wind, Geothermal, Solar, Energy & Transmission Corridors).

<DESC>The Government intends to award a competitive task order for a Contractor to take one or more HIPAA Privacy Rule de-identified data sets and, using methods and technologies that exclude "brute force" matching, demonstrate the ability or inability to re-identify the data. Re-identify means to accurately and unambiguously match the de-identified data record to an actual individual. It is important to note that the de-identification provision permits a covered entity to consider health information to be de-identified when it has removed all 18 identifiers and the covered entity does not have actual knowledge that the information could be used alone or in combination to identify the subject individual. Outcomes/Objectives of this project are to increase access to CMS data through the creation of public use data and a means of accessing these data, while continuing to strictly protect beneficiary and provider confidentiality. <br /><br />This notice is provided for informational purposes only as required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA-2009) (Pub. L. 111-15). CMS intends to award a task order under its Expedited Research and Demonstration (XRAD) Task Order Contract (TOC). The XRAD TOCs were competitively awarded in 2006 to six (6) Small Businesses under the procedures of FAR Subpart 16.5, Indefinite Delivery Contracts. Task Orders are awarded competitively in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1), "Fair Opportunity for Consideration Process". No additional information is available.<br /><br />This effort will be performed within two (2) years from the Date of Award. The Contracting Officer has determined that the most appropriate contract type is Cost Plus Fixed-Fee.<br />

<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) posts this notice of intent to issue a contract to EA Engineering, Science &amp; Technology for services to prepare a comprehensive design drawing, specifications, construction cost estimates, calculations and other follow-up and related services, including preparation of the bid package and perform construction inspection services during construction for the Replacement of NOAA/NMFS Laboratory Sea Water Intake/Delivery System at Galveston, TX. The AE will also be responsible to provide the detail Topographic survey.</p>
<p>In September 2009, NOAA awarded Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) Number DG133F-08-BU-0043/C003, against GSA Schedule GS10F0228J to EA Engineering, Science, &amp; Technology of Lincoln, NE for Geotechnical/Engineering Consulting Services for the Analysis of Sea Water Intake and Delivery System Options to support the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Galveston Laboratory. The current requirement for services to prepare a comprehensive design drawing, specifications, construction cost estimates, calculations and other follow-up and related services, including preparation of the bid package and perform construction inspection services during construction is essentially follow-on work to the work that EA Engineering, Science &amp; Technology of Lincoln, NE performed under BPA Number DG133F-08-BU-0043/C003, against GSA Schedule GS10F0228J, which expired in December 2009. To consider sources other than EA Engineering, Science &amp; Technology would be inefficient and could compromise the Government's ability to meet the project completion schedule. A Contractor other than EA Engineering, Science &amp; Technology would need additional time to acquire the knowledge necessary to fully understand the Government's requirements. Thus it is in the Government's best interest to acquire the follow-on work from EA Engineering, Science, &amp; Technology.</p>
<p>This notice is for full disclosure compliance and announcement of potential subcontracting opportunities only. No competitive solicitation package is available, and no offers will be accepted from any source other than EA Engineering, Science, &amp; Technology, 221 Sun Valley Blvd., Suite D, Lincoln, NE 68528.</p>

The goals of the bowhead and right whale programs are to study North Pacific right whales in the southeastern Bering Sea and to study bowhead feeding ecology in the Western Beaufort Sea north of Alaska. The proposed study will deploy long term moored acoustic recorders in the Bering and Beaufort Seas to acoustically monitor the occurrence, movements, and vocalizations of cetaceans. Oceanwide Science Institute will be supplying the instrumentation and technical support services for the operation and maintenance of the recording units. These acoustic recording instruments are unique instruments that meet all requirements of NMML's program and were used in previous two seasons.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate and award, on a sole source basis, a modification to Contract W9127S-05-C-0013, Rehabilitation of Turbines, Ozark Powerhouse, awarded to Andritz Hydro Corporation.  The modification would require Andritz Hydro Corporation to provide the materials, equipment, and services to rewind the existing generators on the three hydropower turbines at Webbers Falls Powerhouse, Webber Falls, OK. This action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.<BR><BR>Andritz Hydro Corporation is currently rehabbing eight hydropower turbines.  In order for the rehabbed hydropower turbines at Webbers Falls to perform at their maximum capacity level, a generator rewind is required. The capacity of the rewound generators will be increased from 20 MW to 25 MW to match the turbine capacity. The existing generators within the hydropower turbines were manufactured by General Electric. General Electric owns the technical data and drawings of the generators, and is the sole manufacturer of a major component of the generators, stator winding, required to perform the rewind services. Due to the proprietary nature of the component, General Electric will not release the required data and/or pricing to other vendors. Replacing the stator winding is the primary objective of the generator rewind service. Because Andritz Hydro Corporation has purchased the assets of General Electrics Hydro Division, Andritz Hydro Corporation has access to the technical data, technical drawings, and stator winding required to complete the generator rewinds.<BR><BR>This notice of intent is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for proposals. Solicitation document are not available. Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received within fifteen (15) days from publication of this synopsis. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. All responses must be directed to Janetta Daugherty at Janetta.B.Daugherty@usace.army.mil.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has identified Coronary Stents as candidate items for consolidated contracting through the Prosthetics Sensory Aid Service (PSAS).  The purpose of consolidated contracting is to obtain user uniformity and quality products at lower than current contract and open-market prices. 1.2 Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of this solicitation is to establish supply sources that will provide the contracted items for Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Services at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC).  The objectives are to insure availability and consistency of product for nationwide usage and to obtain volume-based, committed use pricing. 1.3 Contract Duration.  The base contract period will be for one year, with four unilateral one-year option periods that may be exercised by the Government. 1.4	Contract Effective Date.  The effective date of the contract shall be 45 days (or sooner upon mutual agreement) after the date of award.   Delivery of products shall be made to the individual VAMCs, FOB Destination, in accordance with the specific delivery instructions contained within the delivery orders.1.5	Award by Product Line. Awards will be made by line item.  VA has specified in the schedule how many line items will be awarded in each Product Line. All relevant items must be included in the offer/s.   Delivery Method will be utilized (See 3.0). The intended scope of this contract includes all current and future products that become available under the awarded line items.  The solicitation details the pricing information required to be submitted for these line items. Prices will be established for each of the PRODUCT LINE - CONSIGNMENT items.  VA recognizes that this market is not static and we need to have access to state-of-the-art technology.  Therefore, in addition to the items initially contracted for, the scope of this contract includes all Drug Eluting Stents and Bare Metal stents which become available during the course of the contract.  New or modified items may be added to or deleted from the contract at a later date in accordance with paragraph 4.0 Technology Refresh. 1.6 Multiple Awards.  This solicitation will result in fixed price contracts.2.0 EXTENT OF OBLIGATION2.1 Government Participants. The contractor shall provide the products specified in the contract directly to VAMCs throughout the United States and Puerto Rico at the prices awarded herein and under the terms and conditions set forth in the contract.  Individual VAMCs shall issue delivery/purchase orders to the contractor which shall indicate the specific items ordered, item quantities, and all necessary delivery and payment procedures.   2.2 Estimated Quantities.  See Schedule of Supplies for estimates.  There is no expressed or implied guarantee that the estimated quantities will be purchased under this contract.  The only guarantee is the minimum guarantee elsewhere stated in this solicitation.  Actual quantities may exceed or be less than those represented.  The estimates are for the total procurement, not per contract..2.3 Report of Sales Successful offerors will be required to provide a quarterly report of sales by line item, no later than 60 calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter ending March, June, September and December. Reports shall be sent electronically to the Department of Veterans Affairs National Acquisition Center to the designated contract specialist until the contractor is notified, in writing, of a different point of contact.  The quarterly sales reports must be provided to the VA as indicated in Clause AS 6001. 2.4 Medical Center Contractor Selection.  Each medical center will review the awards made under this solicitation and decide which contract best meets the needs of the facility taking into account the contractor's ability to provide service and the physician's medical determination as to which products will best meet the needs of his/her patients.  VA's choice of a delivery method is consignment. Upon selection of a contractor, the medical center will provide written notice of its intent to use the contract and its requirements.  Medical centers may change contractors at any time or use more than one contractor.					3.0 DELIVERY Agreement  3.1 Delivery Requirements.  The successful contractors shall provide two delivery methods.  The Medical Centers will either order in the "Just-in-Time" manner (section 3.2) or will use the "Consignment Agreement" (section 3.3).  The purpose of the two delivery systems is to meet the needs of medical centers that perform occasional procedures and/or the needs of those that perform significant number of implant procedures.  After award, each facility that will be using an awardees' contract will inform the contractor of the chosen method of delivery. Urgent delivery is upon receiving notification no later than 2:00 PM local time the day before surgery. The awardees shall supply to the appropriate medical center personnel all required items by 7:00 AM the following day.  The Government will pay the difference between Normal and Urgent freight charges. The implants shall arrive pre-sterilized.  In emergency situations, the contractor must be capable of delivering within a few hours on the same day.  Orders must be received and delivered seven days per week in these situations. All product deliveries shall go through Supply, Processing & Distribution (SPD).    3.2 Just-in-Time - Vendor shall deliver the product pre-sterilized.

Unused items will be returned to the vendor at the end of the term of this contract without reimbursement to the contractor or other expense to the Government. 4.0 Technology Refresh  A.  All implants offered shall be state-of-the-art technology.  "State-of-the-art" is defined as the most recently designed components which are announced for marketing purposes, available, maintained and supported in accordance with requirements specified in the solicitation.

<p>Quantity: 1 - High-Speed Portable Inertial Profiling system (IPS)<br />Provide price list for equipment and options.</p>
<p>General<br />The IPS shall be designed specifically as a portable IPS suitable for collection of road profile data at highway speeds. The IPS will be used to collect road profile data in both wheel paths at the same time on construction projects for determination of ride quality acceptance and payment to a contractor of appropriate incentives or disincentives. The availability of a GPS system for locating start/stop, surface roughness features, event markers, etc. is desirable, but not required. If available provide a quote as an add-on option.</p>
<p>The IPS shall meet the requirements of AASHTO PP11 and be certified to meet the requirements of AASHTO PP 49 at both a lower and upper speed limit when operated in accordance with AASHTO PP 50. Specify the lower and upper speed limits at which certification is achievable. The minimum acceptable cross correlation value is 92 when operated on a typical dense graded &frac34; in nominal maximum Superpave hot mix asphalt pavement.</p>
<p>Exceptions to the AASHTO standards and additional requirements follow.</p>
<p>Operation/Specifications<br />The IPS shall require only one person to operate (i.e., the vehicle driver).</p>
<p>The IPS shall be portable and capable of being mounted by a single person on different vehicles via a standard class III (2 in. x 2 in.) receiver. If the ISP utilizes a class II receiver provide a class III adapter.</p>
<p>No electronics shall be allowed in the vehicle except the operator notebook PC.</p>
<p>The IPS shall be able to operate in an outdoor ambient temperature range of at least 32 degrees F to 105 degrees F.</p>
<p>The IPS shall be operable at highway speeds between 15 and 65 mph while providing a reporting interval of 2 inches.</p>
<p>The IPS shall be capable of running off any vehicle 12v DC power supply by connecting to a standard trailer connection plug or a cigarette power adapter. Provide adaptors to accommodate connecting the IPS to the three most popular vehicle pin configurations (6 pole round, 7 blade, and 7 round pin).</p>
<p>The line laser sensor modules shall be adjustable for position to allow placement over the center of different width wheel paths.</p>
<p>Data collection and data storage shall be via a notebook PC.</p>
<p>The IPS shall provide for operation in SI units or US Customary units, and allow selection of the reporting interval.</p>
<p>The data collection software shall allow the IPS operator to enter operational parameters and other information, including:</p>
<p>- Beginning and ending station of the road section to be tested<br />- Increasing or decreasing stationing during the test run<br />- Longitudinal profile filter length<br />- IRI reporting interval<br />- Data file names</p>
<p>The IPS software must allow for selection of a longitudinal profile filter length of up to at least (300 ft.).</p>
<p>During data collection, the operator shall be able to enter Event Marks from the PC keyboard. The keystrokes shall be stored with the corresponding location.</p>
<p>Real time data acquisition and reporting of IRI is preferred. Distance measurement must display in real time.</p>
<p>The IPS shall be capable of producing profile files in Pavement Profile File (ppf) or .ERD file format. Both of which are compatible with ProVal 3. The PPF file format is preferred. The IPS software and data acquisition system must store the data in a raw format such that filter parameters can be changed for multiple post processing operations.</p>
<p>Hardware<br />The IPS shall include two line lasers (transducers) operating at a minimum of 3 kHz. Either a Roline 1130 or Roadmap 100 is acceptable.</p>
<p>The vertical line laser displacement sensors shall have a measuring range of at least 200 mm, i.e. +/- 100 mm from the mid-range position.</p>
<p>The vertical displacement measuring resolution of the laser sensors shall be at least 0.05 mm.</p>
<p>The IPS shall incorporate a minimum of two accelerometers and two height sensors appropriate for the intended use of the equipment.</p>
<p>The IPS shall provide accurate distance measurement via either a digital encoder wheel assembly linked to one of the vehicles wheels or an optical distance encoder system. Digital encoder wheel assemblies shall include all necessary hardware for mounting on multiple vehicles. Identify the number of different vehicles and number of adaptors required to accommodate mounting on those vehicles. The digital encoder wheel assembly shall be easily transferable between vehicles and shall not require the cutting or splicing of any wire(s) in the hosts vehicle's electronic system.</p>
<p>The IPS shall be equipped with a photocell device and shall enable automatic start and stop of data collection by placing reflective tape on the pavement. It shall also enable recording of location(s) of reflective tape(s) on the pavement during data collection.</p>
<p>The IPS shall include a transducer mounting system that is a mechanically rugged beam, tube or box, made from corrosion resistant material, such as painted or anodized aluminum, stainless steel or powder coated steel.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format found in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.
The solicitation number for this request is 70181AQ050 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 05-38) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  
This is a small-business set-aside procurement under NAICS classification code: 332312 and PSC:B534.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.
STATEMENT OF WORK:
Background: The US Fish and Wildlife Service is currently working to expand its polar bear research program in the Chukchi Sea to areas of eastern Russia.  Though polar bears can be captured via helicopter off the US coast of the Chukchi Sea, capturing bears in eastern Russia cannot be accomplished via aircraft.  Instead, we intend to use culvert traps to capture bears. Additionally, the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, US Fish and Wildlife Service is initiating a long-term in-depth study of the impacts of climate change, bear-viewing, and fluctuations in resource availability on Kodiak brown bears in the southwestern region of the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge.  Bears will be captured through the use of a helicopter and a culvert trap in order to target bears that utilize the Karluk Lake basin.   Rather than use a standard culvert trap that is in one piece and weighs 400-500 lbs, we are in need of a culvert trap that can be broken down into smaller, lighter pieces and transported throughout remote areas of the Arctic and Kodiak Island.  The bears the USFWS will be capturing weight approximately 1300 lbs.  
Traps with the design described below must have been field proven for capturing black, brown, Malayan sun bears, or polar bears in the wild.  Interested vendors must verify the use of their traps and designs for these bears for research purposes.  To establish past performance interested vendors must provide: at the the time of bidding three (3) professional references of customers their traps have been utilized successfully in capturing bears.
Interested vendors must provide detailed photos or diagrams of the safety door and frame, the trigger assembly, the side windows with darting ports, the assembly hardware, and a complete assembled trap along with the bid as well as documented proof of the safety door mechanisms functionality.
The vendor shalll provide hands-on instruction of the assembly and the operation of the traps at the time of delivery to Anchorage, AK.
One of the primary concerns of these traps is the safety to both animal and humans.  The USFWS does not have pictures or diagrams to provide.
SPECIFICATIONS OR EQUAL:
Traps - 1. High grade aluminum2. Six individual segements measuring 5 feet long by 48 inches high3. Two ends to fit trap4. Individual segements fastend together with cam-locks5. All fasteners, assembly hardware, and cam-locks should be huck-riveted6. No loose bolts or nuts in the construction or assembly7. Entry door should be framed 54 inches square that should fold down flat to the dismantled trap8. Six window openings of 1/2 inch stainless steel mesh with darting ports; approximately 6 inches by 12 inches,   One on each end and two on both sides9. Total weight approximately 400 lbs10. Tube diameter approximately 48 inches by 10 feet long11. The entire dismanteled trap will be transported (in one trip) in a 16 foot rubber raft or boat
Safety Door and Trigger Mechanism - 1. Safety door mechanism must automatically stop the door upon any hint of contact with any object (ie: cub) from being struck or injured if the mother bear has already tripped the trigger mechanism.2. A braking mechanism on the door should stop the door instantly mid fall if the door comes in contact with any object (ie: cub) during the downward travel.3. The doors mechansim should be created with a self-releasing mechanism so it continues to close as soon as the object (ie: cub) clears the doorway.4. The safety door should be designed and tested by a professional engineer.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />The contractor will be responsible for the implementation or completion of strategies and activities outlined in this documents and identify the expected products. To learn more, visit: http://www.montereybay.noaa.gov/educate/merito/welcome.html</p>
<p>GOAL<br />To increase protection of sanctuary resources by building a greater understanding of ocean related threats within our diverse communities and providing opportunities to engage in marine protection.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />There is a need to provide our constituent base with an understanding of the National Marine Sanctuary Program, local sanctuaries and the issues facing them. Our Hispanic communities represent the fastest growing population in California and currently comprise 32% of California's population. This is the only programming reaching our diverse communities, specific to ocean related issues. The progress made to date has been highly successful and very well received. We are now a trusted source of information and have even been asked to develop a volunteer program to accommodate the communities' need to get involved. Currently the main target audiences for MERITO are underrepresented students and Spanish speaking adults. Programs focus on priority issues including water quality protection, marine reserves, beach closures, wildlife disturbance and fishing issues.</p>
<p>The MERITO plan was developed in collaboration and partnership with agencies and organizations serving Hispanics, in an effort to provide expanded bilingual outreach and education about marine and coastal environments and their conservation to youth, teachers, adults, migrant families and community leaders. The three main programs of MERITO, (Spanish meaning is "merit" or "worth") serve to:</p>
<p>&#61485; Collaborate with K-12 schools, adult schools and community groups to build upon and foster new community-based outreach for Hispanic youth, adults, migrant families, and community leaders,<br />&#61485; Collaborate with natural resource management agencies like California Department of Parks &amp; Recreation and National Estuarine Research Reserves to increase visitation by Hispanic youth, adults and migrant families through site-based outreach,<br />&#61485; Collaborate with colleges and universities to develop and provide teacher trainings and college internships for Hispanic-serving teachers and undergraduate and graduate level students.</p>
<p>TASKS <br />1. Program Oversight: <br />&bull; Develop MERITO program and evaluation reports for fiscal year 2010/11. Work with the formats developed with the Coastal Services Center and NMSP for Program Design and Evaluation.<br />&bull; Provide recommendations to procurement staff regarding equipment, supply, and service acquisition while monitoring the budget and acquisitions.</p>
<p>2. Fund Development:<br />&bull; Develop grant proposals to at least two major organizations above $50k and two smaller proposals under $50k, in collaboration with the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation and the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation.</p>
<p>3.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for Economic Modeling and Forecasting Software Application and Subscription
<p>Office of Policy Development</p>
<p>March 2010</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates an award of a Firm Fixed Priced contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA), the US Census Bureau anticipates awarding a Sole Source contract to Interindustry Economic Research Fund, Inc. that incorporates one (1) basic year, and four (4) options for increased quantities, the total of which will not exceed the requirement for five (5) years {FAR Parts 17.204(e) &amp; 17.204(f)(3)}.</p>
<p>Solicitation No. ESA-RFQ-10-0000-OPD-FR-010 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>This notice and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) is an agency under the United States Department of Commerce that produces, analyzes and disseminates national economic and demographic data. Its three primary missions are the following:</p>
<p>1.	Maintain the highest possible quality Federal statistical system and make improvements where warranted and feasible.</p>
<p>2.	Communicate a vision of the key forces at work in the economy and of the opportunities they create for improving the well-being of all Americans.</p>
<p>3.	Support the information and analytical needs of the Department and the Executive Branch.</p>
<p>The ESA oversees the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the United States Census Bureau.<br />The Office of Policy Development (OPD) provides analysis of economic developments and policies affecting business performance and the economy for the Chief Economist, the Under Secretary, and other senior officials. OPD staff participate in interagency economic and policy working groups on issues ranging from current industry and macroeconomic conditions to new technologies and innovation.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of OPD include the ability to evaluate impacts to industries and the economy. In order to evaluate industry impacts, OPD has since 2001 been using the Inforum LIFT (for Long Term Forecasting Tool) model and the Iliad (for Interindustry Large-scale Integrated And Dynamic) model of the U.S. to measure interindustry transactions consistent with industry value added in the economy and total economic final demand or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and total income or Gross Domestic Income (GDI).</p>
<p>GDP, considered the most useful summary measure of the nation's production, measures final purchases by households, business, and government by summing consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. GDP is consistent with another economic measure, called GDI which also measures total incomes earned by households by summing wages and salaries, rents, profits, interest, and other income.  The LIFT and Iliad models are consistent with both GDP and GDI.</p>
<p>LIFT Model &amp; Iliad Model Overview</p>
<p>LIFT Model Overview</p>
<p><br />The Inforum LIFT model is unique among large-scale models of the U.S. economy. Combining an interindustry input-output (I-O) formulation with extensive use of regression analysis, it employs a "bottom-up" approach to macroeconomic modeling. LIFT's bottom-up technique possesses several desirable properties for analyzing the economy:</p>
<p>1.	The model works like the actual economy, building the macroeconomic totals from details of industry activity, rather than distributing predetermined macroeconomic quantities among industries.</p>
<p>2.	The model describes how changes in one industry, such as increasing productivity or changing international trade patterns, affect related sectors and the aggregate quantities.</p>
<p>3.	Parameters in the behavioral equations differ among products, reflecting differences in consumer preferences, price elasticities in foreign trade, and industrial structure.</p>
<p>4.	The detailed level of disaggregation permits the modeling of prices by industry, allowing one to explore the causes and effects of relative price changes.</p>
<p>LIFT is a full macroeconomic model, with more than 800 macroeconomic variables determined consistently with the underlying industry detail. This macroeconomic "superstructure" contains key functions for household savings behavior, interest rates, exchange rates, unemployment, taxes, government spending, and current account. LIFT contains full demand and supply accounting for 97 productive sectors.</p>
<p><br />In summary, the LIFT model is particularly suited for examining and assessing the macroeconomic and industry impacts of the changing composition of consumption, production, foreign trade, and employment as the economy grows through time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Iliad Model Overview</p>
<p><br />Iliad is a more detailed I-O model that has been developed as a companion to the LIFT model. Iliad is a 360-sector model of the U.S. economy, forecasting all components of final demand and value added, as well as prices and employment. The model currently operates in 2000 constant dollars, and is based on a benchmark 1997 input-output table.</p>
<p><br />Iliad also forecasts employment, value added components, and prices, at the 360-sector level. The Iliad model currently relies on the LIFT model for more aggregate drivers. The user of Iliad can either use LIFT variables to directly index the growth of the corresponding detailed sectors in Iliad, or use existing equations to forecast the detailed industries, and then control them to LIFT growth rates or levels. Equations exist for employment and imports, which can then be scaled to conform with LIFT totals, if so desired.</p>
<p>[END OF OVERVIEW]</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF NEED</p>
<p>The Government is contemplating awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the purchase of the most current version of LIFT-model and Iliad-model economic forecasting software, and an annual subscription to the LIFT and Iliad annual economic forecasts.</p>
<p>1.0	Background</p>
<p>In 2009, OPD used the LIFT model for an interagency study on the economic impacts of implementing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAF&Eacute;) provision and the Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) provision of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act. While demonstrating that the CAF&Eacute; provision mandates are feasible, the study also demonstrated that the RFS provision mandates are not feasible. In addition to these findings, the study was able to show the impact on the economy and industries of reaching levels of energy efficiency and substitution that would not have been obtained if the Act were not in existence.</p>
<p>Also in 2009 and extending into 2010, both the LIFT and the Iliad models were used as a resource to provide detailed CO2 emissions estimates for 360 sectors in the Iliad model for industries, government and households.  These estimates, then, can be used in a variety of forums such as in climate change and international trade policy analysis.</p>
<p>2.0	Requirement</p>
<p>In order to conduct these types of analyses, OPD requires an interindustry I-O model that measures interindustry transactions consistent with industry value added in the economy and total economic final demand (GDP). The model needs to be versatile enough so that impact to individual industries can be simulated in the economy (known as a "bottoms up" analysis approach) as well as the effects of macroeconomic variables on individual industry performance (known as a "top down" analysis approach).</p>
<p>The model also needs to relate output to jobs by occupations and by number of employees, and predict output and employment, and employment by occupation, for over 350 NAICS industries, thus providing the industry-detail needed in OPD industry analysis. ESA and OPD require a solution that meets all of these criteria.</p>
<p>3.0		Scope</p>
<p>The primary goal of this contract action is to obtain the most current software versions of Inforum's LIFT model and Iliad model software, and an annual subscription to the LIFT and Iliad annual economic forecasts.</p>
<p>4.0		Applicable Documents</p>
<p>Attachment 1, Invoicing Procedures</p>
<p>5.0		Deliverables</p>
<p>The Contractor shall deliver all deliverables to the COTR at:</p>
<p>Wesley Dias<br />Economics and Statistics Administration<br />1401 Constitution Ave N.W. - Room 4841<br />Washington, D.C. 20230<br />(202) 482-4165 - wdias@doc.gov</p>
<p>In order to support the needs of the ESA and the OPD, the Contractor shall provide:</p>
<p>&bull;	The latest version of the LIFT and Iliad model software so that the OPD can run industry forecast simulations, as needed.</p>
<p>&bull;	The historical database used to support the LIFT and the Iliad models is included in the model software.</p>
<p>&bull;	Forecasts, for approximately 20 years into the future, of industry output, employment, and trade among other variables such as productivity for the 100 sector LIFT model and the 360 sector Iliad model.  The forecast shall also include estimates of macro-variables such as GDP for the same forecast period.</p>
<p>&bull;	An annual subscription to the LIFT and Iliad economic forecasts in print and CD ROM formats.</p>
<p>&bull;	Technical support/services packaged in units of 25 days to be used on an ad hoc basis.</p>
<p>6.0		Required Format for Contract Deliverables<br /> <br />The Contractor shall provide one copy of the software in the latest version of both the LIFT and Iliad models in the form of a CD-ROM.  The Contractor shall also provide the OPD with an electronic version of the historical data used to support the models, and the forecasts of both industry and macro-variables, also on CD-ROM. The Contractor shall provide one or more paper-bound versions of the forecasts for both LIFT and Iliad models.</p>
<p>No software or forecasts generated by the contractor will be made available by OPD to any requesting Government or private entity without the prior written approval of the Contractor.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for providing ESA with deliverables that conform to the Acceptance Criteria in Section 6.1 herein. The Contractor shall provide the deliverables to the COTR within 15 days of the date of award.</p>
<p>6.1		Acceptance / Quality Assurance</p>
<p>The Contractor shall submit the deliverables in the required format, to the COTR as outlined in Section 5.0 and 6.0 herein. ESA reserves the right to review the deliverables and to reject any software media determined not to conform to contract requirements.</p>
<p>ESA will provide the Interindustry Economic Research Fund, Inc with written notification relating to defective or non-conforming  deliverables within 30 days of receipt of the deliverables. The Contractor shall provide a replacement of defective software media to the COTR within 7 days of receiving such notification from the Government. These replacements shall be provided at no cost to the Government.</p>
<p>Acceptance of the contractor's data will be determined by the ESA's examination of the deliverables. The Contractor is expected to improve the quality (as necessary) of subsequent deliverables based on input from the OPD regarding the current deliverables.</p>
<p>The deliverables shall reflect the characteristics on the ensuing list, such that ESA and OPD management and staff easily understand the deliverables. The data shall be:</p>
<p>o	Submitted within the required timeframes (consistent with customary industry practice);<br />o	Consistent with industry practice;<br />o	The latest available, in the correct units and for the correct time period;<br />o	Free of errors, and;<br />o	Submitted in the format specified in Section 6.0.</p>
<p>6.2		Price/Cost of Deliverables</p>
<p>The following are the calendar year prices of the deliverables being acquired under this contract for the base period and the options. The contractor agrees to deliver the deliverables described herein at the prices listed on the table for all options that are exercised under this contract.</p>
<p>In consideration of the Contractor's full performance of the contract, and in accordance with the terms of the contract, the Economics and Statistics Administration will pay the contractor a fixed price for each contract line item (CLIN) that conforms to sections 5.0, 6.0 and 6.1 that is delivered during a Period of Performance that has been exercised. The Contractor's offer price shall include any and all costs and expenses, direct and indirect, as well as any profit, fee, or any markups of any nature.</p>
<p>Option Periods 1 through 4 are optional supplies (option quantities) that may be exercised at the government's discretion through a unilateral modification and are subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS OF ONLY ONE SOURCE:</p>
<p>Interindustry Economic Research Fund, Inc.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a noncompetitive contract under the provisions set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as authorized by 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p>The lack of competition for this procurement action is due to the Office of Policy Development's (OPD) need for an economic modeling and forecasting solution that provides a "top-down" and "bottom-up" analyses capability. LIFT is unique in that it allows for such a "top-down" and "bottom-up" analyses; users can impose a macroeconomic solution on the model and derive corresponding industry outputs ("top-down") or modify interindustry relationships and solve for the impact on macroeconomic variables ("bottoms-up"). For OPD's projects to assess direct impacts to industries, it will be necessary to modify interindustry relationships that can only be done with LIFT.</p>
<p>In order to perform the required economic analyses OPD requires an economic forecasting model that is versatile enough so that impacts to individual industries can be simulated in the economy. This "bottoms-up" analysis approach is unique to the LIFT model. The model must also have the ability to simulate the effects of macroeconomic variables on individual industry performance. This "top down" analysis approach is common to the LIFT model, as well as to other industry models. The model also needs to relate output to jobs by occupations and by number of employees. The INFORUM LIFT model that will be provided by IERF is the only model known to EAS and OPD that meets all of these criteria.</p>
<p>Furthermore, LIFT, when used with the Iliad model, predicts output and employment and employment by occupation, for up to 355 NAICS industries, while other models predict output for fewer NAICS industries. Thus, LIFT provides the greatest industry detail needed in OPD industry analysis.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the Government knows of only one source capable of providing the required supplies at the desired level of quality.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6 AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>**************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Purchase Request Number: F3W4010071AQ01 Request for Proposal. This document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.</p>
<p>**************************************************************************************</p>
<p>The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation (available from http://farsite.hill.af.mil)</p>
<p>52.212-1 - INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. A purchase order will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government. An evaluation of "Technically Acceptable" will be assigned when the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal and the offeror meets the performance and technical capability<br />requirements defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>A copy of the company's business license(s) and a narrative summarizing the company's experience with similar work are required to be submitted with the proposal. The narrative must include statement of understanding regarding the Government's requirement to be provided with the HVAC and electrical certificates for technicians prior to the performance of such work. Also, one of the following documents are required: a Meisterbrief or an ISO 9001 or 9002 certificate. Proposal must be submitted on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1) After determining that a complete and acceptable proposal has been received in accordance with the requirements, offers shall initially be ranked according to price, as identified under the Description of requirement above. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>2) Next, the government technical team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors (approximately the lowest 5 proposals) against the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>--Business License(s): Business licenses submitted will be evaluated to determine if the contractor has authority to perform in Germany.</p>
<p>--A Meisterbrief or an ISO 9001 or 9002 certificate: Documentation will be reviewed to determine relevant experience.</p>
<p>--A narrative summarizing company's experience with similar work. Narrative must include statement of understanding regarding the Government's requirement to be provided with the HVAC and electrical certificates for technicians prior to the performance of such work. Documentation will be reviewed to determine relevant experience.</p>
<p>3) By submission of an offer, the offeror accedes to these terms. Award will be made without discussions - contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing with their response. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and a technical standpoint. Failure of an offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>4) Once determinations are made regarding technical acceptability of proposals, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror who submitted a proposal rated technically acceptable. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding<br />contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) &#61551;&#61472;In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) &#61551; Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror &#61551; does &#61551; does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror &#61551; does &#61551; does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
      It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer.

Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.

<DESC><p>***&nbsp;18 March 2010 ***</p>
<p>The following questions pertaining to the purchase description have been proposed and the responses from the engineer accompany this amended combined synopsis solicitation. The due date for responses has also been extended from 26 March 2010 to 6 April 2010.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.3 Measurement Uncertainty<br /></span></strong></p>
<p>Q: The uncertainty budget of &plusmn;0.20% only leaves &plusmn;0.05% for the LFWS system. Does this also include the &plusmn;0.5&deg; temperature control effect on viscosity? Will the reference meters be calibrated on multiple fluids and a multi-fluid Roshko Strouhal table be used or will each meter be calibrated for a single viscosity. Will be able to see samples of the reference meter data to evaluate the effects of multiple viscosities or interpolation variations on the uncertainty?</p>
<p>A: The &plusmn;0.5 &deg;F is of a nominal set point. The uncertainty of the temperature measurement is therefore the relevant measure for uncertainty.<br />Single or multiple viscosity characterizations will be based on the requirements at each location. If a specific number of calibration points for the reference meters are required to meet the requirements, please state that in the proposal.<br />The AF calibrates turbine flowmeters at 10% full scale increments from 10% to 100% of full scale, and at 1% full scale increments below 10% full scale.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.1 Flow Rate Control</span></strong></p>
<p>Q: Is there any considerations given to prevent over speeding of the flowmeters under test? Is there any desire to protect the reference turbine flowmeters from over speeding?</p>
<p>A: This can be proposed as additional capability.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.3 Pressure Control</span></strong></p>
<p>Q: Are you requesting that the test pressure be at 150 psig or do you want the pressure to be adjustable up to 150 psig?</p>
<p>A: Adjustable up to 150 psig.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.5 Software<br /><br /></span></strong>Q: Does the software need to allow some access to underlying equations so that the Air Force may change them in the future if desired? Is password security access acceptable?<br /><br />A: Our experience has proven that access to equations can result in accidental changes that negatively affect measurements, and it is unlikely that the fundamental underlying equations will need to be changed.<br />Password security access is not acceptable.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.5.1.1 Test Instruments</span></strong></p>
<p>Q: Based on the number of available outputs, do you require multiple meter calibrations? <br /><br />A: The LFWS shall be capable of calibrating multiple meters. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.5.2 Reference Meters</span></strong><br /><br />Q: Does this mean that more than one master meter might be used to calibrate a flowmeter under test? Where are the reference meters to be installed? It appears the two test sections are intended for units under test. We need clarification on the intended installations.<br /><br />A: More than one master meter may need to be used to calibrate a flowmeter under test.<br />The reference meters can be installed in either meter section.<br />Two sections are required, and a test instrument may ultimately be installed in the same meter section as the reference meter. In that case, if that is the only meter being calibrated, the other meter section is not used and the "straight pipe" identified in 4.5 would be installed in the unused meter section.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.5.7 Software Warranty</span></strong><br /><br />Q: Will AFMETCAL be willing to install revised software, or will the supplier have to travel to site?</p>
<p>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;AFMETCAL will distribute the software and it will be installed by each individual lab.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.1 Calibration Fluids</span></strong><br /><br />Q: Will the fluids be changes regularly? What procedures are required to prevent contamination of the hydrocarbons with water and vice versa? Are there explosion proof requirements since Mil-C-7024 has a low flash point?<br /><br />A: While only speculation, it is believed that fluids will not be changed very regularly.<br />Procedures to prevent contamination will be developed by the Air Force or can be incorporated into the design and/or stated in the manual.<br />Necessary considerations based on these fluids should be incorporated into the proposed design.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.4 Drain Pan</span></strong><br /><br />Q: Are the reference turbine meters in the same section as the test meters?<br /><br />A: They can be but are not required to be.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.5 Meter Sections</span></strong><br /><br />Q: Would this be a 2" AN fitting?<br /><br />A: This paragraph indicates that the design shall accommodate at least two inch diameter meters. If the design is to 2", then a 2" AN fitting would be appropriate.</p>
<p>Q: How many flowmeters do you want to calibrate at one time? Are both test sections functional and producing calibration data at the same time? <br /><br />A: The number of flowmeters calibrated at one time would be based on pressure drop and/or the amount of inputs.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.5.1 Sliding Test Instrument Surface</span></strong><br /><br />Q: Please clarify this requirement?</p>
<p>A: Traditional positive displacement liquid flow calibrators have a drip pan with angled surfaces to direct spilled fluid down into a pipe for recirculation. Having a flat, sliding, test instrument surface that spans the drip pan allows for instruments such as rotameters to sit on or to be propped up onto for vertical positioning and stability. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.5.3 Flow Straightening</span></strong><br /><br />Q: Are you requiring a set of different flow straighteners to cover &frac12;" up to 2"?<br />What end fittings are required on the flow straighteners?<br /><br />A: The piping leading to the meter sections shall have sufficient flow straightening, thereby not decreasing the meter section length as described in 4.5.<br />Fittings are addressed in 4.5.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.5.3 Meter Section Temperature, Densities, and Viscosities</span></strong><br /><br />Q: Does this imply that the temperature probe will be located at the output of the reference flowmeter and the input of the meter under test?<br />Are you asking for multiple temperature sensors to be placed at the inlet of both the reference flowmeter and the meter under test?<br /><br />A: The temperature probes are at the inlet of each meter section, upstream of the meter(s) in that section. The temperature at each inlet is used for determination of fluid density and viscosity of that meter section.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.8 Size<br /></span></strong><br />Q: Are there some space restrictions that require the length to be restricted to 10 feet long? Would 164" be acceptable?<br /><br />A: Yes, there are space restrictions that dictate this requirement. 164" is therefore not acceptable.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.9 Portability</span></strong><br /><br />Q: How do you intend to move the LFWS with a chilled water source and air supply hooked up to the calibrator? Do you require flexible hoses for these connections? If so, how long?<br /><br />A: Castors allow for moving the LFWS around the lab, more for positioning the unit originally and in the future as needed, rather than for moving it in the context of operation as the question implies.<br />Flexible hoses do not need to be supplied.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.11 Power Requirements</span></strong><br /><br />Q: Will a fused disconnect and plug be provided or is that part of the installation requirement?<br /><br />A: Fuse size should be stated and can be integrated into the unit.</p>

(Amended 17 March 2010). ________________________________________________________________<br /><br />QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (16 MARCH 2010)<br /><br /></span></strong>QUESTION 1:&nbsp; Can the Government provide an IGCE?<br /><br />ANSWER 1:&nbsp; No, the Government does not provide that type of information for a soliciation.<br /><br />QUESTION 2:&nbsp; Is there an incumbent currently providing the services requested? And if there is, who is the incumbent?<br /><br />ANSWER 2:&nbsp; No, there are currently no vendors providing these services.<br /><br />QUESTION 3: Is NGA requiring assistance for ISO Certification or contractor support separate from the certification?<br /><br />ANSWER 3:&nbsp; The registrar will perform the assessments listed in the SOW. We are not requiring consulting services, the requirement is for ISO registrar services.<br /><br />QUESTION 4:&nbsp; According to "Section 3.1 Assessments" of Solicitation No HM017710R0010, it appears that the NGA is looking for a registrar and not a contractor to help conduct internal audits. Would the Government please clarify whether this is the case?<br /><br />ANSWER 4:&nbsp; The term "contractor" is a general term equivalent to "vendor" or "company". "Registrar" and "Certification Body" are more specific terms, but in the context of this SOW they are synonymous. A "company" not accredited as a "registrar" cannot perform the required services.<br /><br /><strong><br />___________________________________________________________<br />SECTION 3.8 OF THE SOLICITATION IS HEREBY MODIFIED TO INSERT THE NAME OF THE CONTRACTOR UNDER PROVISION 5X52.209-9004 - USE OF CONTRACTOR SUPPORT (OCT 2009).

<DESC>The following eight(8) points of additional pertinent information are provided for all whom intend to offer a quote for this service:
<p>1. Nose gear is temporarily affixed due to crash and MLG may or may not require removal. Coast Guard may choose to use low time gear for fleet spares.</p>
<p>2. Both engines are low time since overhaul and needed for fleet spares.</p>
<p>3. Horizontal and Vertical Stabilizers were recently overhauled and many components and primary structures are in Ready For Issue (RFI) condition, and will be used for Fleet Spares.</p>
<p>4. The necessary insured value of the aircraft, while in the contractor's custody, is to cover any damaged incurred during maintenance and transport procedures. The aircraft property value is $5.2M (or 5.2 Million Dollars).</p>
<p>5. There will be no A&amp;P Certified sign-off needed on components disassembled or sign-off on any stage of dismantlement.</p>
<p>6. The anticipated disposition of the aircraft parts/material is to maximize reutilizations of aircraft and components.</p>
<p>7. The aircraft will be placed in storage with the possibility of reclamation at a later date. We have numerous airframes stored at AMARG that we regularly use to reclaim hard to procure parts. All structural parts indentified by the Coast Guard will need to be removed IAW OEM procedures, packaged and transported properly because we intend to reuse these parts.</p>
<p>8. There are no objections to retracting the MLG versus removal provided this can be done without damaging the aircraft.</p>
<p>In consideration of the aforementioned, the Closing Date and Time of this solicitation is extended to 4:00 PM EST, 25 March 2010. The original statement of work remains the same.</p>

The current fleet of riverine vessels is approaching the end of its service life. To maintain operational viability, OAM intends to procure up to 80 Riverine Shallow Draft Vessels (RSDV); initial base year plan is to purchase 29 RSDVs. All RSDVs will be powered by one gasoline powered &ldquo;hybrid designed&rdquo; water-jet engine. The RSDV will be required to operate in shallow rivers and lake areas of the United States. The RSDV will be required to operate in 4 inches of water and be capable of safely transiting areas containing rocks, gravel, trees/logs, sandbars, and vegetation while providing the Border Patrol Agents-Marine (BPA-M) with a safe working platform to perform their duties and missions.

<DESC><p><strong>SOLICITATION NOTICE</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Glynco, Georgia an Agency of the U. S. Department of Homeland Security is seeking qualified Design/Build firms to provide design and construction services for a renovated administration facility at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Glynco, Georgia. This procurement is 100% 8(a) set aside. Size standard under NAICS 236220 is $33.5 million; Project Cost range is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. The work requires design and construction (renovation) of a 24,600 square ft., three story administration facility at the FLETC Glynco Campus, Glynco, Georgia. The estimated magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00 with a performance period of 550 calendar days. It is anticipated that 3 to 4 firms will be selected from this Phase One solicitation for participation in the RFP/Phase Two solicitation.</p>
<p>The administration facility is a 24,600 square ft., three story steel framed structure used for office space in support of training programs at the FLETC. This project will include demolition back to the structural elements then renovation to a new administrative facility. Furnishings, equipment and fiber/copper/cable TV cabling shall be provided for all spaces. Personnel elevators and space for electrical, mechanical, IT and janitorial equipment are required. ADA requirements shall apply to first floor only. Site improvements such as exterior lighting, sidewalks, landscaping and handicapped parking are included. Existing parking space will remain as is. The building will have the goal of reducing energy use by 30% compared to the baseline building performance rating per ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Energy Standard for Buildings. The building must be able to achieve a LEED Silver rating; documentation must be provided to confirm LEED rating; submission for certification will be a government option.</p>
<p>Additional design and construction criteria for the project will be included in the RFP package. The RFP package will include the Phase Two selection factors and will be issued to the firms selected from the Phase One solicitation. The RFP package will include design criteria for code compliance, performance and prescriptive specifications, design and construction submittal requirements, space utilization plans, floor plans, elevations, wall sections, finish schedule, conceptual site plan, site survey, and soils report. These were developed more than four years ago and may not be adequate for the construction/renovation work to be accomplished at this time. The criteria will rely upon industry standards, where allowable, to afford the Offeror a degree of design flexibility while meeting specific project requirements. The successful Offeror must design and construct a complete and usable facility as described in the RFP documents.<br /><br />The facility shall be constructed within budget identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and be fully usable upon acceptance by the Government. A quality control person and superintendent shall be on site at all times during the construction. The Contractor's safety program shall be administrated by a certified safety specialist. The quality control person shall be independent of other on-site personnel and shall devote his time exclusively to work under this contract. Quality control, safety, and environment plans shall be prepared for and approved by the Government prior to the start of construction. The period of performance is 550 calendar days.<br /><br />The Government intends to award a single (one (1)) contract as a result of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; to award the contract to other than the proposer submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government. This will be a two phase evaluation. Phase One will result in the development of a short list of approximately four (4) firms who will proceed to Phase Two. Phase One evaluation will be made solely on the written responses provided to the Government. Phase Two evaluations will be based on technical and price proposal submissions and result in selection of a single firm. Phase Two award will be based on technical evaluations and pricing with technical and pricing weighting approximately equally. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offeror's. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Offeror's should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.</p>
<p>An Offeror's proposed Phase Two team, including the firms and key personnel proposed in response to Phase One Solicitation, and as supplemented for purposes of the Phase Two Solicitation, must continue to remain fixed for the duration of the Contract except as noted herein. An Offeror may add consultants, subcontractors and/or key personnel to supplement design and/or construction resources as necessary to address proposal deficiencies. If extraordinary circumstances require a proposed change either during the solicitation or after contract award, the request with rationale must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer, whom at his or her sole discretion, provides written authorization of the change. Requests for a substitution must either be submitted prior to the submission of the Final Proposal Revision or must be clearly indicated in the Offeror's Proposal Cover Letter. The Offeror shall provide the complete qualifications and experience of the firm or individual proposed to be substituted. Changing personnel may affect an Offeror's overall rating. Unauthorized changes can result in the elimination of the Offeror from the Phase Two competition.</p>
<p>Proposal Preparation - Phase One and Phase Two: Provide technical proposals complying with all instructions provided herein. The technical proposal shall be completely severable from the price proposal and shall not contain any pricing information. Do not exceed a total of fifty (50), 8-1/2" x 11", type written pages.

<DESC>The mission of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), DCTD, NCI centers on the discovery and preclinical development of agents with clinical anticancer potential. Preclinical pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies are an early and integral part of the overall drug development process and contract resources for preclinical development studies have existed in DTP continuously since the late 1970s. Characterization of the pharmacokinetics of new compounds provides important information for the selection of optimal drug development candidates and for the design and interpretation of preclinical efficacy studies, including the selection of formulations, routes, and schedules of administration. Moreover, one objective of preclinical toxicology evaluations is the correlation of toxic effects of a compound with plasma concentrations and/or area under the curve (AUC). The successful outcome of these studies thus depends heavily on the availability of sensitive methods for quantifying compounds in biological fluids and the careful integration of preclinical pharmacology and toxicology data.<br /><br /><br />Project Requirements<br /><br />Activities of any contract awarded from the proposed solicitation will include, but not be limited to, the following tasks:
<p>(1) Development of sensitive analytical methods to quantify compounds in plasma, urine, tissues, and other biological matrices;</p>
<p>(2) Plasma stability and protein binding studies, which are conducted at an early stage of compound development to ensure proper sample handling and to aid in the interpretation of in vivo studies;</p>
<p>(3) Pharmacokinetic evaluation of test compounds following administration to animals by various routes and schedules, including a determination of bioavailability by various routes;</p>
<p>(4) Quantification and identification of drug metabolites generated in vivo and in various in vitro systems (S9 fractions,<br /><br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will consist of five (5) years, from December 15, 2010 through December 14, 2015.</p>

<SOLNBR>DHSEAGLE2
<RESPDATE>043010
<CONTACT>Holly Donawa, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-447-5566, Email holly.donawa@hq.dhs.gov - Purnell Drew, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-447-5557, Fax 202-447-5550, Email purnell.drew@dhs.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) EAGLE II &ndash; Small Business Overview: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a significant and continued need for information technology (IT) services to support the execution of its mission. DHS has met that need principally through the use of the Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions (EAGLE). The original EAGLE suite of contracts was awarded to 25 large businesses (in June 2006) and 28 small businesses (in September 2006) across five (5) functional categories with a five year base period and two (2) one (1) year options. Under this arrangement, individual task order competition can be limited to small businesses within a selected functional category if there are two or more small businesses that can provide the required services. For details on the current EAGLE contract, please visit the DHS open for business website at: http://www.dhs.gov/xopnbiz/opportunities/editorial_0700.shtm. As required per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), contractors are required to re-represent their size status for long-term contracts, those contracts in excess of 5 years, if a merger or acquisition occurs, or if there are contracts with novation agreements. The purpose of the re-representation rule is to improve the accuracy of small business size status reporting. This rule was added to all of the EAGLE contracts. Nine (9) of the original 28 EAGLE small businesses have since been acquired by larger firms; thus, they no longer have small business status but can compete for task orders which are not set-aside for small businesses. DHS expects that a majority of the existing EAGLE small businesses will not qualify as &lsquo;small&rsquo; at the end of year 5 of the contract. With 19 small businesses remaining in the EAGLE suite of contracts and 2 &frac12; years of contract performance remaining, DHS does not plan to &ldquo;ramp-up&rdquo; (add contractors to the EAGLE suite of contracts). Instead, the plan is to consider proceeding with EAGLE II &ndash; Small Business. Background: The existing EAGLE contract serves as a department-wide platform for acquiring Information Technology (IT) service solutions in five functional categories (FC's): &bull; FC1 &ndash; Engineering Design, Development, Implementation and Integration &bull; FC2 &ndash; Operations and Maintenance (2 tiers; 1 without telecommunications and 1 with telecommunications) &bull; FC3 &ndash; Independent Test, Evaluation, Validation and Verification &bull; FC4 &ndash; Software Development &bull; FC5 &ndash; Management Support Services In reviewing the EAGLE task orders awarded to date, DHS has observed that FC3 has rarely been used and FC5 is best leveraged when included as part of each EAGLE task order requirement. In addition, preliminary small business market research has indicated that the small business IT community is capable of providing services involved in categories FC1, FC2, and FC4. Further, DHS has noted that an increasing number of small businesses are capable of providing IT services that have a substantial telecommunications element - currently FC2 &ndash; Tier 2. Strategy: Accordingly, DHS has developed two one page charts summarizing alternative approaches (please see Attachment A &ndash; Alternative Strategy Using Small Business Category Tracks and Attachment B &ndash; Alternative Strategy Using Functional Category Tracks). Alternative 1 utilizes a small business category approach where task orders would be competed within separate pools for 8(a) small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small businesses, small businesses, and IT/Telecommunications small businesses. Alternative 2, utilizes a functional category approach where award pools would be established using functional areas of work. The scope of each contract would be limited to that functional category and market research would determine which small business category would be the targeted pool. EAGLE II &ndash; Small Business will continue to be a suite of Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity services-based contracts that will enable all DHS components to acquire IT support services to accomplish their mission objectives. DHS believes that either of the proposed approaches provides outstanding opportunities for the small business community, while enabling DHS to benefit from a highly capable small business IT talent pool. Additionally, both approaches support our ongoing commitment of identifying opportunities for the various federal small business programs. Requirement: The DHS Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), invites interested vendors to respond to this notice by providing comments on the attached draft &ldquo;EAGLE II &ndash; Small Business&rdquo; proposed plans for the follow-on effort for the EAGLE contract (see Attachments A and B). It is important to note that vendor responses are solely for the purpose of requesting industry feedback and neither constitute pre-competition, nor will responses be evaluated in any way. These draft plans should not be construed in any way as the official EAGLE II &ndash; Small Business plans, nor do they commit DHS to a particular course of action or a particular timeline. This is a market research effort to gain insight into the capacity of the small business community to meet continuing DHS IT requirements. Vendors are invited to address any subject(s)/issue(s); however, the Government is particularly interested in feedback and comments in these areas: o Alternative Strategy using a Small Business Category (Attachment A) or Functional Category (Attachment B); o Utilization of a 2-Phase award process for EAGLE II, i.e. where phase 1 will evaluate vendors on a fairly limited basis short of full proposals such as capability statements and phase 2 would be full proposals including price for those small businesses invited to continue to phase 2; o Performance-based considerations; and, o Industry Best Practices that might be appropriate to consider in planning and executing EAGLE II-Small Business. All vendors interested in submitting a response should do so electronically to DHSEAGLE2@dhs.gov no later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, on Wednesday February 25, 2009. This submission should not exceed 10 pages. Efforts should be made to keep responses as BRIEF as possible, concentrating on substantive information. The Government will not pay for the cost of response submissions. Vendors must appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information. DHS will adhere to Federal Acquisition Regulation policy on handling proprietary information. This is not a Request for Proposal and no contract will be awarded as a result of this RFI notice. The Government reserves the right to post additional notices relative to the RFI and request capability statements and/or similar documentation. Please note that no registration is required nor is a bid list maintained.

STATUS OF EAGLE II SMALL BUSINESS REQUIREMENT AS OF APRIL 28, 2009: Vendor responses to the February 10, 2009 Request for Information for &ldquo;EAGLE II-Small Business&rdquo; were received on February 25, 2009 and have been reviewed. The government is currently solidifying its acquisition strategy based on the overwhelming responses from industry. Additional information will be provided through subsequent FBO announcements regarding which alternative strategy the government intends to utilize for the upcoming EAGLE II-Small Business procurement. An Industry Day is anticipated to discuss the government&rsquo;s approach and to answer questions submitted by vendors. More information will follow within the next quarter regarding the proposed Industry Day. DHS thanks vendors for their interest.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Engineering Service Division (ESD), Elizabeth City, NC, intends to competitively acquire engineering processes, technical and training support for the Coast Guard's logistics transformation effort and to sustain current users of the Asset Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS). Requirements exist for support services in the following locations: Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Elizabeth City, NC, Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC) Baltimore, MD, and the Aviation Training Center (ATC) in Mobile, AL.</p>
<p>Asset Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS) has long been employed by Coast Guard Air Stations as a means to track maintenance actions and operational data of Coast Guard aircraft; specifically the Electronic Asset Logbook (EAL) and Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) functions of the system. EAL and ACMS programs are vital to the logistical support of Coast Guard assets by; tracking usage rates, documenting scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, ensuring asset configuration integrity, and documenting operational data. Based upon the success of the system, the Logistics Transformation Program Integration Office (LTPIO) will be expanding the use of ALMIS to include all assets in the Coast Guard. The Decision Support System (DSS) is a module in ALMIS that provides; integrated help, web reports and Power Play Cubes. A cube is a file that is created by aggregating data along a number of dimensions and storing it in such a way that it can be accessed quickly. All the dimensions in this cube can be accessed and changed in a rapid manner. The data might be operational hours including dimensions such as time, unit, and asset number. Coast Guard active duty, government employees and some contractors located at Coast Guard Headquarter\Areas\Districts\Air Stations\Sectors\Groups\Units and Cutters must be trained to gain the ability to perform operational and maintenance data entry and analysis using ALMIS. IMPROTANT: The Coast Guard is not entertaining new software and/or hardware configuration. The anticipated release date for the Request for Proposed (RFP), HSCG38-10-R-500004 will be on or about the 11 February 2010 with an anticipated closing date and time for submission 10 March 2010 at 2:00 P.M. local time. The solicitation and all corresponding documents will be available at the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. An award of a firm-fixed price IDIQ competitive contract to the offeror whose conformance to the RFP will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered is anticipated.

<DESC>Premier Data Services has been awarded the subject requiremement.  Below is a description of the task required and services being provided.  The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey, title, and legal land description information to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and title information in support of parcel based display of geographic information.  The Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) is the digital portrayal of the PLSS and is assembled in a series of working ascii files and a geo-database for publication.  This task order is to improve the accuracy of the depiction of the PLSS within GCDB.
This task will consist of three major components:  1) Field collection of GPS observations on 584 PLSS corners, 2) Incorporation of this more accurate control data via GMM into individual target township data sets.  3)  Regional adjustment (GMM), Attribution Quality Assurance (FIXAN), and topology Quality Assurance (FIXLX) workload, to produce regionally adjusted, seamless CADNSDI compliant GIS coverages for ARRA townships and similarly updated GMM source files.  The goal is to reasonably depict these areas in GCDB.
Remonumentation of government corner positions is not allowed under this award.  Monuments shall be described as found and not rehabilitated.  The contractor will not use accessories to establish a corner position, but accessories may be used to verify that a monument is in the position of record.

<DESC>Premier Data Services has been awarded the subject requirement.  Below are the of the requirement.
Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, the Montana BLM has been tasked with ensuring positional mapping accuracy of records and boundaries in support of renewable energy development. The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey information and GPS positions to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System in support of parcel based recordation, as well as analysis and display of geographic information.  This information known as the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), has been assembled in a series of ascii flat files which is converted to a GIS format to support stakeholders and customers of the information. 
The geographic location of the identified renewable energy townships, is primarily in areas having the potential for renewable energy in support of the current administrations energy priorities and in the transmission of that energy.  
This work will include the research of survey information for each corner in preparation for recovering survey corners and measuring their positions with survey grade GPS receivers.  Research may be conducted on federal, state, or private/local government survey records.   Work shall include research that is needed to efficiently locate, record information, and measure the location of survey corners or boundary locations.  Only one coordinate pair in North American Datum 1983 (NAD 83), is needed for all rectangular or non-rectangular corners.  The accepted GPS measurements will be used for control in the GCDB.   Digital photographs of found monumentation as well as other evidence such as bearing trees etc. shall be collected.  This work shall be performed on approximately 1000 corner positions in 147 townships.

<DESC>Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, the New Mexico BLM has been tasked with ensuring accuracy of the attributes of digital land records.  The geographic location of the identified renewable energy townships is primarily in areas having the potential for renewable energy in support of the current administrations energy priorities and in the transmission of that energy.  There are 1266 townships associated with renewable energy.  All work is limited to these 1266 townships.
The vendor shall compare MTPs and HIs against title documents to ensure that land ownership status is accurately depicted and described.  Documents are to be compared to MTPs, Use Plats, and LR2000 digital records to ensure data are accurately described as noted.  These documents include any and all types of cases noted on the plats.  Records that have not been scanned will be scanned by the vendor during this process.  The vendor shall then examine all Rights-of-ways or other case file types for review of those cases within the jurisdiction of the field offices.  These examinations will likely involve scanning of records that have not yet been scanned.

THE R&D EFFORTS WILL DEVELOPADVANCED LOW NOX COMBUSTOR TECHNOLOGY.&lt;P&gt;NASA Glenn Research Center has committed support for specific efforts under the AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Recovery Act funds for NASAs Aeronautics ResearchProgram will accelerate key research, enhance the state of aeronautics for the nation,and expand the viable and well-informed trade space for vehicle design decisions andenable simultaneous realization of National noise, emissions, and performance goals. Withthe NASA Research Announcement (NRA), NNH09ZEA001N, NASA sought proposals that willidentify new combustor concepts capable of meeting N+2 NOx goals.&lt;P&gt;The specific area of support for this work, per NASAs Recovery Act Program Plan forAeronautics Research, is to develop low emissions combustor concept capable of meetingthe LTO (landing and take-off) NOx emissions reduction goal while contributing to theachievement of the fuel burn goal and without negatively impacting other emissions. Thelow emissions combustor should be capable of meeting the N+2 LTO NOx goal of 75%reduction from the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) standard adopted atCAEP 6 (Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection).&lt;P&gt;This is a cost share contract awarded under a full and open competition. The contracttype of Cost share was determined based on the high complexity of the work andperformance uncertainties that cannot be sufficiently identified or their cost impactsreasonably estimated.

<DESC>FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY - This contract modification provides Recovery Act (ARRA) funding to create and develop a public query tool (application) to enhance the research capability of the NIDDK Central Data Repository. The Repository stores data from various multi-center trials and epidemiological studies. It also acts as a central coordinating entity by facilitating efficient distribution of data and samples. However the wide variety of studies and the complexity of data collection activities in the various studies makes it difficult for outside researchers to identify the resources that would be most useful. This contract modification will create a public query tool to simplify searches or repository resources to the general public. It will also create tools for repository statisticians to search across studies and perform meta-analyses, learning by combining selected data from various studies. This project will enhance the computerized interface of reasearchers with the NIDDK Central Repository. This is a change to the NIDDK Repository that will have the effect of increasing the efficiency that researchers can explore the available data sets and biological samples for research studies. The amount of time outside researchers need to spend to determine whether or not data sets will support planned studies will be greatly reduced. As such this will be an improvement to the research infrastructure at the Repository.<br /><br />NOTE: This action is not fixed price. The contract is cost reimbursable because the complexity required to coordinate, maintain, and manage a National biomedical research database repository depends on variables that are unknown prior to contract performance. Because of the unknown variables, a cost reimbursable type contract is most appropriate.

<p>In accordance with FAR Part 5.7, Publicizing Requirements Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), this is a notification of a modification to an existing, competitively awarded, Time-and-Materials (T&amp;M) Delivery Order HHSN276200900301U (Protiviti) under the requirement entitled RECOVERY - Professional Information Technology Program and Technical Services to Support the Federated Identity Management Initiative. This deliver order was previously competed and awarded in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 8.402 Federal Supply Schedules.</p>
<p>It is the intent of The National Library of Medicine for Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to modify existing award, competitively awarded Time-and-Materials (T&amp;M) delivery order to Protiviti Government Services under the company GSA Contract No. GS-35F-0435N. The purpose of the modification is to incorporate additional labor hours within the statement of Work in order for the contractors to further support CIT with the design and implementation of federated identity management solutions that comply with OMB's e-Gov initiatives as defined in the E-SIGN Act, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, the E-GOV Act, OMB M-04-04, NIST SP 800-63 and other allied documents.

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance, W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs and valve bulkheads to de-water the structures. This work can only be performed when the valves are dewatered.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  3)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  The contractor will already be on site to dewater and repair the lock and this work can be performed at the same time utilizing some of the same specialized equipment and personnel already on site.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR><BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to extend it Science and Engineering Apprenticeship Program (SEAP) contract, number W81XWH-09-D-0031, awarded to George Washington University (GWU) for an additional six months through September 30, 2010.  This non-competitive contract extension will allow for continuance of scientific, technical, adminstrative and educational support services to the SEAP student apprenticeship programs sponsored by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), the Army Research Office (ARO) and the other DoD military services.  The contract modification will be accomplished without competiton because thee is no other source who could continue the performance of services effective April 1, 2010 without interuption and continuity of services.  The ARO anticipates the award of a new. competitive Cooperative Outrach Agreement (COA) contract effective October 1, 2010 to continue performance of these services in support of SEAP.  The SEAP has three components: (1) SEAP; (2) College Qualified Leaders Program (CQL) and; (3) the Gains in Education and Mathementics Program (GEMS).  The contractor provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment for the administration, technical and educational support of the program, to include the three components described above.  The SEAP will transition to ARO and the COA on or before October 1, 2010.  The COA consolidates twelve educatonal programs under one umbrella and ARO has issued solicitation W911NF-10-R-0002 for proposals to support the new COA which will be competitively awarded by October 1, 2010.  ARO anticipates multiple awards willbe made for the COA.  The announcement can be viewed at http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?Action=6&Page=8. Parties interested in the SEAP or any other programs consolidated under the ARO COA may also contact ashley.wade@us.army.mil.
