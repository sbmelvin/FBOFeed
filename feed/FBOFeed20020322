<DESC>USAID/BOLIVIA contemplates issuing a Request for Application (RFA) for a five (5) year health activity in support of USAID/Bolivia?s Health Strategic Objective to improve the health of the Bolivian population. Specifically, the purpose is to help bring about healthy behaviors, client-friendly health services and participatory health systems.  The 5-year activity will do this through two major mechanisms: 1) a small grants program through which funds will be channeled to non-governmental organizations in the health field; and 2) provision of technical advisory services in a range of health areas.  The sub-grants will support lines of action directly related to the 3 intermediate results of the health strategic framework.  The intermediate results are: 1) Strengthening people?s health-related knowledge and practices, so that they better protect and promote their health and seek required health services in a timely and cost-effective manner; 2) Improving the coverage and quality of health services, so that they can resolve people?s health needs satisfactorily and in a way that respects clients? rights; and 3) Promoting a decentralized and participatory health system that responds to community needs and is subject to social control by the community.  Typically, sub-grants will finance decentralized, locality-specific work that tailors already-proven best practices to the local context, resulting in measurable improvements in people?s health.  To provide the technical advisory services, a database of largely Bolivian-based specialists will be established.  Maintenance of USAID/Bolivia?s TraiNet database is a third component of the activity.

The NAIC Code for the above award is 541990. 

Interested parties should submit via APO mail, fax or courier their expressions of interest to the Agreement Officer. Approximately two weeks after this notice USAID/Bolivia will release RFA-Bolivia 511-02-011. USAID/Bolivia intends to make one (1) award from this RFA to the most responsible firm/organization whose proposal offers the best value to the Mission. USAID/Bolivia plans to complete this competitive process as soon as possible and make an award no later that September 15, 2002.

The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet. 

This CBD notice can be viewed and downloaded using the Agency Web Site. The solicitation, once issued, can be downloaded from the Agency web site.

<DESC>This notice is provided on a sole source basis, with an intent to award a firm fixed price order with State University of New York (SUNY), Hearing Research Laboratory and Dr. Donlad Henderson. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items,  prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number, N00259-02 -T-0030 is issued as a request for quotations(RFQ).  Clin 0001: Non-personal service contract for  Research services for the period 01 Apr 2002 to 31 Mar 2003.  Qty: 1; Unit of issue: year .  The duties to be performed shall be in accordance with the statement of work.The statement of work reads:  INTRODUCTION: The Department of Defense Spatial Orientation Center of Naval Medical Center, San Diego staff conducts ongoing projects in auditory and vestibular research. ABREVIATIONS: DOD = Department of Defense, ONR = Office of Naval Research, NMCSD = Naval Medical Center San Diego, SUNY = State University of New York, CRADA = cooperative research and development agreement, GPOC = Government Point of Contact, DSOC = DOD Spatial Orientation Center, AO = antioxidant, ROS = reactive oxygen species, FR = free radicals, L-NAC = acetyl-L-cysteine, ALCAR = acetyl-L-carnitine, IP = intraperitoneally, SPL = sound pressure level, kHz = kilohertz, sec = second, COL = Colonel, MC = Medical Corp, FY = Fiscal Year. SCOPE: Contractor will conduct research into noise-induced hearing loss protection in support of funded investigations under the ONR Military Operational Medicine program. This program encompasses research into developing countermeasures for the prevention of tissue/organ damage prior to exposures to high-energy sources (loud sounds) and to develop methods for prevention and rescue of neurosensory tissues with exposures to exotic energy sources. This work entails performing a series of experiments over a 12-month period.  AIM: This study will extend our previous noise-induced hearing loss model (which used continuous sound exposure) to impulse noise and kurtotic noise. The investigation entails utilizing the best antioxidant (AO) compounds from year one?s investigations.  For this series of studies we will investigate the effects of AOs in protecting and rescuing hearing after exposure to impulse noise and kurtotic noise.  
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  At the NMCSD site: We will investigate the effects of AOs in protecting and rescuing hearing after exposure to impulse noise and kurtotic noise. In one set of animals (3 groups: 1 control; 1 ALCAR; 1 L-NAC), AOs will be given before and after exposure to noise to investigate protective effects.  The second set (3 groups: 1 control; 1 ALCAR; 1 L-NAC), will receive the AO treatment only after exposure to investigate rescue effects.  Both of these sets of groups will receive a noise exposure that will consist of impulse noise of simulated M16 rifle fire (150 dB peak SPL; 100 shots, interval of 1 impulse/sec).  A total of 36 animals will be utilized for these series of experiments.  At the  site: These series of experiments will be designed as performed in section 3.1 except that instead of impulse noise, kurtotic noise will be will consisted of continuous octave band noise centered at 4 kHz; 90 dB SPL and 113 dB peak SPL applied 1/sec impulse noise 3h duration, replicating occupational noise exposure. All kurtotic noise experiments will be run at SUNY Buffalo in the laboratory of Donald Henderson.  In one set of animals (3 groups: 1 control; 1 ALCAR; 1 L-NAC), AOs will be given before and after exposure to noise to investigate protective effects.  The second set (3 groups: 1 control; 1 ALCAR; 1 L-NAC), will receive the AO treatment only after exposure to investigate rescue effects. ).  A total of 36 animals will be utilized for these series of experiments.  Duties:   The contractor shall perform a full range of research procedures, within the scope of his/her training and experience, on site using SUNY furnished facilities, supplies and equipment. Workload occurs as a result of scheduled and unscheduled requirements for research activities.  Primary workload is a result of experiments generated to pursue the specific aims of research protocols funded by the Office of Naval Research and the DoD Spatial Orientation Center (DSOC), Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD).  Contractor is responsible for a full range of experimental requirements in auditory physiologic research including: animal preparation and care, calibration and quality control of sound equipment and measurements, kurtotic noise exposures, physiologic assessments, collection and gathering of biological specimens, shipping of biological material, planning and execution of research within the personnel and equipment capabilities of the facility, and the quality and timeliness of experimental records and reports required to document procedures performed and services provided. Contractor shall monitor supply and material levels and work with appropriate personnel to reorder supplies, animals, and materials as needed to support ongoing and planned research. Contractor will expose chinchillas to kurtotic noise consisting of continuous octave band noise centered at 4 kHz; 90 dB SPL and 113 dB peak SPL applied 1/sec impulse noise 3h duration. In the first set of protection experiments three groups of animals of six each will be designated as Control, ALCAR, and L-NAC groups.  For the L-NAC group, L-NAC will be given by intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 325 mg/kg 48 hrs before and one hour following noise exposure, then BID the following 2 days after exposure to noise to investigate protective effects.  The ALCAR group will receive IP injections of ALCAR (100mg/kg) and the Control group will be given saline injections at the same volume on the same schedule as the L-NAC group. The second set of rescue experiments 3 groups of six animals each (Control; ALCAR; L-NAC), will receive the AOs in the same concentrations as in first set of experiments but the treatments will be administered only after exposure to investigate rescue effects.  Again the control animals will be noise-exposed but received the saline injections. A total of 36 animals will be utilized for these series of experiments.
Contractor is responsible for performing hearing assessments using auditory brainstem response (ABR) via subcutaneous needle electrodes placed in the skin of the head and proximal to the ear on all animals.  In the protective group, the ABRs will be obtained prior to injections of AOs or saline, after injection of AOs or saline but before noise exposure, one hour after noise exposure, and 1, 2, 3, weeks post noise.  ABRs will be obtained in the rescue group before noise exposure, one hour after noise exposure, and on day 11 and day 21 post-noise exposure. Contractor will, immediately upon completion of the final threshold measurements, euthanized the animal and then the cochleae will be harvested. Cochleae will be perfused with room temperature 4% paraformaldehyde solution buffered with 0.1 Molar phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After suitable fixation time, the specimens will then be perfused and rinsed with 0.1M PBS and then stored and shipped in this solution at 4o C to NMCSD for hair cell counts.  Contractor will provide oversight and guidance for all procedures and data analysis of all experiments at the Baylor University Medical Center, Institute of Metabolic Disease site.  Contractor will also work closely with COL.

<DESC>This notice is provided on a sole source basis, with an intent to award a firm fixed price order with Baylor University Medical Center, Insititute of metabolic Disease for a period of one year (base year) plus one option year. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number, N00259-02 -T-0031 is issued as a request for quotations(RFQ).  Clin 0001: Non-personal service contract for  Research services for the period 01 Apr 2002 to 31 Mar 2003.  Qty: 1; Unit of issue: year . Clin 0002:  Option year 1 for the period 01 Apr 2003 to 31 Mar 2004.  The duties to be performed shall be in accordance with the statement of work.The statement of work reads. INTRODUCTION: The Department of Defense Spatial Orientation Center of Naval Medical Center, San Diego staff conducts ongoing projects in auditory and vestibular research. ABREVIATIONS:  DOD = Department of Defense, ONR = Office of Naval Research, NMCSD = Naval Medical Center San Diego, BU = Baylor University, GPOC = Government Point of Contact, DSOC = DOD Spatial Orientation Center, ROM = reactive oxygen molecules, FR = free radicals, SPL = sound pressure level, mL = micro liter, kHz = kilohertz, HPLC = High Pressure Liquid Chromatography, COL = Colonel, MC = Medical Corp, FY = Fiscal Year.  SCOPE: Contractor will conduct research into cochlear biochemical responses to intense noise exposures in support of funded investigations under the ONR Military Operational Medicine program. This program encompasses research into developing countermeasures for the prevention of tissue/organ damage prior to exposures to high-energy sources (loud sounds) and to develop methods for rescue and treatment after exposure to exotic energy sources. This work entails performing a series of experiments over three years to: (1) understand the cochlear intracellular biochemical response to damaging sound energy, (2) to identify and delineate the reactions involved with glutathione metabolism and reactive oxygen molecules (ROM) and free radicals (FR) produced by oxidative stress in response to acoustic over-exposure, and (3) utilize our recent antioxidant technology to increase hair cell glutathione or antioxidant defenses to reduce the formation of and damage caused by FRs and ROM molecules in order to prevent hair cell damage or death caused by traumatic noise. The first year encompasses three experiments (A, B and C). Experiment A involves studying groups of chinchillas under no noise conditions to characterize baseline biochemical and metabolic responses of the auditory hair cells.  Experiment B entails exposing the same number of animals, first to one hour of no noise for baseline measurements and then for four hours of continuous noise at 105 dB SPL octave band noise centered at 4 kHz.  In Experiment C animals will again undergo one hour of baseline measures (no noise) then be noise-exposed for four hours but prior to noise exposure a glutamate antagonist will be administered to study its capability to reduce perilymphatic glutamate levels and counteract excitotoxicity. The treatment animals will be compared to saline injected noise-exposed animals, which will serve as controls.  In each experiment cochlear perilymph fluid will be sampled using micro dialysis technology.  Perilymphatic samples are taken at a rate of 1mL per minute giving three 20 mL specimens per hour. As control reference for perilymphatic metabolism and to also monitor the stress level of the whole animal, a sample of brain and blood plasma will be taken and measured for the same metabolites. Year two will investigate the efficacy of different glutathione prodrugs that can enhance hair cell glutathione levels in protecting against noise-induced increases in ROM molecules and FRs.  Again cochlear perilymph, brain tissue and blood plasma samples will be taken at the same time schedule. Year three will be very similar to year two. However, this set of experiments will investigate the effects on glutathione and its metabolites as well as the ROM molecules and FRs measured previously, but in these sets of experiments animals will be pre-treated with agents that will enhance the survival of hair cell mitochondria. Again blood plasma, brain tissue and perilymphatic samples will be taken in the time schedule described above. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: In all 2 years and for all experiments, the contractor will receive shipments of frozen blood plasma, brain tissue and perilymphatic samples as collected by micro dialysis sampling.  After careful calibration of equipment, quantification of the following metabolites: glutamate, cysteine, reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione, malendialdehyde and dihydroxybenzoate will be measured from each perilymphatic aliquot and from each brain and plasma specimen. The contractor will assess the biochemical events taking place in the cochlea during quiet conditions and then following damaging sound exposure utilizing high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).  This study will elucidate the cellular biochemical response of hair cells to noise-induced damage and investigate the capability of glutathione enhancing and mitochrondrial protectants to prevent noise-induced cell death (apoptosis).  The brain tissue and blood plasma samples will be used for controls and to determine the effect of the noise stress on the state of the animal.  Duties:  The contractor shall perform a full range of research procedures, within the scope of his training and experience, on site using Baylor University Medical Center furnished facilities, supplies and equipment. Workload occurs as a result of scheduled and unscheduled requirements for research activities.  Primary workload is a result of experiments generated to pursue the specific aims of research protocols funded by the Office of Naval Research and the DOD Spatial Orientation Center (DSOC), Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD).    Contractor is responsible for a full range of experimental requirements in neurochemical research including the planning and execution of research within the personnel and equipment capabilities of the Baylor University facility, and the quality and timeliness of experimental records and reports required to document procedures performed and services provided. The research worker shall monitor supply and material levels and work with appropriate personnel to reorder supplies, and materials as needed to support ongoing and planned research. Contractor is responsible for screening for and identifying with chemical processing and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) the following metabolic compounds from perilymphatic dialysates, brain and blood plasma samples: oxidized and reduced glutathione, glutamate, cysteine, dihydroxybenzoate and malendialdehyde. In year one it is projected that there may be between 2700 and 2800 samples of perilymph, 90 tissue samples of brain tissue and 90 specimens of blood plasma to analyze. Year two contractors may analyze between 3600 and 3700 perilymph samples, 120 brain tissue samples and 120 blood plasma specimens. For year three it is projected that there may be between 2700 and 2800samples of perilymph, 90 tissue samples of brain tissue and 90 specimens of blood plasma to analyze.  Contractor will provide oversight and guidance for all procedures and data analysis of all experiments at the Baylor University Medical Center, Institute of Metabolic Disease site.  Contractor will also work closely with COL. Richard Kopke, MC, USA, NMCSD Program Manager who has scientific and technical responsibility for this research project, to coordinate investigational efforts, trouble shoot problems that develop and to collate data from the different work sites. Contractor will meet with COL Kopke twice in year one at the NMCSD site.  First meeting will be prior to the start of the project to assist NMCSD staff in the setup, calibration and training in the operation of the micro dialysis equipment and to finalize plans and coordinate timing of collection and shipping of biological specimens. A second meeting is planned near the end of the first year to determine the outcomes and trends of data, analysis of findings and planning for the second year?s research.  Meetings after year one will be coordinated between contractor and COL Kopke. Contractor will organize all data collected for this project in a database/spreadsheet format that is compatible with the NMCSD data manager.  Contractor will organize data for publications and oversee the preparation of manuscripts and summary figures resulting from the work performed in this grant proposal.

<DESC>6.3 Pre-Solicitation Conference Announcement

The Air Force Research Laboratory will host a "Pre-solicitation Conference" for the Fuze Air-to-Surface Technology (FAST) Advanced Development program. (Ref Sources Sought Synopsis MNK-02-007).  The FAST Advanced Development program intends to develop a next generation fuze sensor for precision burst point control of unitary blast/fragment, penetration, and low collateral damage weapons.  

The overall scope of this program is two-fold and addresses two uniquely different objectives as listed below: (1) Design and Fabricate an integrated, brassboard fuze sensor that can operate in a tail mounted configuration on guided weapon platforms that may or may not employ a nose mounted seeker.  (2) Design and Fabricate an integrated nose mounted, foliage penetrating proximity fuze sensor in DSU-33 form factor (Supports the Targets Under Trees (TUT) initiative).  

The design goals for this program are as follows: (1) Less than 0.5 meter error in determining correct, preset height-of-burst (HOB) above the ground contour regardless of target structure and background.  (2) Capable of having selectable HOBs up to 20 meters in increments of 0.5 meter.  (3) Operation in blast/fragment and penetration weapon systems to include ground profiling at velocities from 50-1250 meters/second and the determination of T0 and V0 at velocities up to 2500 meters/second.  (4) Provide a near surface burst mode that will detonate the weapon just prior to the warhead impacting the ground, regardless of orientation.  (5) Capable of interfacing with tail mounted fuzes on unitary weapons.  (6) Operation in adverse weather and battlefield obscurants, including foliage.  (7) Operation in battlefield Electronic Countermeasures/Electromagnetic Interference (ECM/EMI), including mutual interference.  (8) Foliage penetrating, non-ground profiling version, that can be packaged stand-alone as a nose mounted proximity sensor in DSU-33 form factor.  (9) Launch-to-Burst Point Weapon Simulation.  

This program will emphasize development of a robust design backed by high fidelity computer simulations and field demonstration of the nose-mount and tail-mount integrated fuze sensor brassboard units.  

The period of performance for this effort is anticipated to be 34 months.  Potential offerers should, as a minimum, possess and have demonstrated experience in the design and testing of high-resolution, short-range sensors.  Access and Storage of Classified material, up to and including Secret, is required.  Foreign owned firms are prohibited (as prime contractors) from participation in this acquisition.   

The conference is scheduled for 17 April 2002, from 0830-1130 Central Time, Bldg 439 Auditorium, Eglin Air Force Base, FL.  The intent of the FAST Advanced Development Pre-Solicitation Conference is to open communication between the Government and Industry by providing an overview of the program's goals, and obtaining input from industry regarding the acquisition.  Data packages for the FAST Advanced Development program will be provided at the conference.  Additionally, private one-on-one meetings between Government and Industry may also be scheduled for 17 and 18 April, 2002.  These will take place at the Fuze Branch, Bldg 432, Eglin Air Force Base, FL.  Interested contractors may schedule 45-minute blocks of time by contacting Mr. Roger M. Smith, Program Manager, not later than 8 Apr 02, at (850) 882-2005 ext. 210, or email roger.smith2@eglin.af.mil.  To attend either the conference or a one-on-one, and/or to obtain a data package, contractors must forward (1) a valid visit request, and (2) a copy of their export control license (DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement) to:  Ms. Lanya Lester, (850) 882-2005 ext. 203, at lanya.lester@eglin.af.mil, or fax (850) 882-2707, prior to 16 Apr 02.  Individuals/contractors who fail to comply with this requirement will not be allowed in the conference and will not receive the FAST data package.  

Specific information (maps, directions, instructions) will be provided to prospective attendees once intent to participate is received.  

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns from offerers or potential offerers during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Routine or administrative questions should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Program Manager.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of these individuals, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  For serious concerns only, interested parties are invited to contact AFRL/MNK's Ombudsman, Lt. Colonel Mary T. Quinn at mary.quinn@eglin.af.mil or fax number 850-882-9599.

<DESC>In partnership with the Naval Air Systems Command, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force, the Office of Naval Research is soliciting white papers for applied research in the area of enhanced arc fault electrical circuit protection technologies for military and commercial aircraft.

The proposed technical solutions will be required to:

?h Meet MS3320 circuit breaker mounting dimensions and meet all current MS3320 performance specifications 
?h Develop 115 Volt, 400 Hz, three phase arc fault circuit protection with ratings from 5 to 25 amps 
?h Develop 28 volt, direct current, arc fault circuit protection with ratings from 1-25 amps. 

In addition, devices larger than the MS3320 size will be considered if all of the above capabilities are incorporated and the device offers an innovative, fully integrated 115 volt, 400 Hz arc fault circuit protection with 28 volt arc fault circuit breaker.

Other requirements:
?h The device shall detect and remove arcing faults from electrical circuits, reduce potential wiring damage and reduce the risk of fires and other hazardous conditions.  Note: an arcing fault is defined as a variable impedance sustained luminous discharge of electrical power across a gap in a circuit.  

?h The device will be required to communicate data to an appropriate interface and have the capability to be remotely controlled. 

?h The device is required to operate in fighter/attack, helicopter and transport aircraft environments specified in MIL-STD-461 (Requirements for the Electro-Magnetic Interference Characteristics of Subsystems and Equipment), MIL-STD-810 (Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests) and DO-160 (Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment). The device shall operate in conformance with Electrical Interface Specification Document MIL-STD-704A. 

Proposed applied research solutions should be fully compatible with current military aircraft electrical installations. Additionally, solutions must adhere to an "open systems" (i.e. non-proprietary interface) approach as defined by the Open Systems Architecture for Condition Based Maintenance (OSA CBM). All white papers should briefly discuss the feasibility of integrating the proposed solution to wiring systems/weapons systems other than aircraft (ships, submarines, ground vehicles, autonomous vehicles). 

This effort will be conducted in two phases over a three-year period.  The Government expects to make multiple Phase 1 awards (assuming receipt of multiple promising proposals) followed by a down-selection of Phase 2 performers.  The Phase 1 effort will be 12 months and the required deliverable will be a functioning bench top (or smaller) prototype arc fault circuit protection device accompanied by all design documentation.  The Phase 2 (Option) will be 24 months and the required deliverable will be flight suitable hardware with required prototype enhancement and attainment of the packaging requirement described above (see second paragraph).  

The Government reserves the right to include only Phase 1 awardees that have successfully demonstrated progress during the Phase 1 effort in the subsequent evaluation for Phase 2 awards (Exercise of Option).  Successful progress will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Evaluation Criteria for Phase 2 Awards:

1) Satisfactory attainment of technical goals

2) Demonstrated effort to complete Phase 1 on time and within budget

3) Likelihood of Phase 1 success being continued into Phase 2 

Phase 2 awardees will be notified of the Government??s intent to exercise Phase 2 Options within 30 days prior to the expiration date of Phase 1 awards.

It is anticipated that the total available funding for this effort will be $3M of applied research (Budget Category 6.2) or advanced technology (Budget Category 6.3) funds, as appropriate.  The level of year to year funding will be at the discretion of the Government.  Phase 1 awards will range between $250K - $500K and Phase 2 awards will range between $750K - $1.5M. The Government intends to budget and set aside a separate lower amount for Naval Air Systems Command support of this effort.  

Due Date for White Papers:	Not Later Than 2:00 p.m. (EDT) on Monday,          22 April 2002.  All submissions must be received by the due date.

Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award. An offeror may submit a full technical and cost proposal even if its white paper was not identified as promising, but the chance of award is not high. Only those offerors who submit white papers that are received by the requested due date and time will be eligible to submit full proposals. All white papers will be acknowledged and will not be returned after evaluation. This BAA does not provide any funding for white paper or proposal development costs.  It is not the intent of this BAA to establish new facilities.

White papers and full proposal submissions will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR Parts 3.104-5 and 15.207, applicable law and DoD/DoN regulations. Offerors are expected to appropriately mark each page of their submission containing proprietary information. The Government may use selected support contractor personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative functions of any white papers and proposals submitted under this solicitation.  These support contractors will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information. White papers and proposals submitted in response to this BAA are expected to be unclassified. However, classified work can be proposed as long as no classified information is included in the white papers/full proposals. The Navy encourages development of appropriate technical partnerships. Teaming between industry, universities and government laboratories is encouraged to help insure rapid transition of technology and products to the Fleet and industry.  

Award Information
Traditional FAR-based contract awards are anticipated. However, the Government reserves the right to award grants, cooperative agreements, or other transaction agreements to appropriate parties, should the situation warrant the use of a non-contractual agreement. This acquisition does not meet the requirement for use of a Section 845 other transaction agreement. Proposals submitted by a consortium or team require Articles of Collaboration signed by all members prior to execution of the Agreement. The Articles shall define the interaction and commitment of the proposed partners. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this solicitation is 54171 (which corresponds with the standard industrial classification code of 3721 ?V Aircraft Research and Development) with the small business size standard of 1,500 employees.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The government intends to procure these services under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.

All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal in writing, which may be used by the government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the construction of a new Federal Courthouse Annex in Wheeling, West Virginia. The facility shall be approximately 90,000 gross square feet.  The work shall include, but not be limited to, the following: construction of facility that will be occupied by the U.S. District Court, U.S. Probate Office, U.S. Congressman?s Office, Office of the U.S. District Court Clerk, Office of the U.S. Attorneys, and U.S. Marshals Office.  The new facility shall include a new U.S. District Courtroom and associated facilities, as well as secure parking on the first floor.  The new steel structure shall provide for the programmed needs of the identified agencies in a predominantly limestone, brick and glass four-story facility.  The structure shall consist of a granite base.  There is a 1,700 square foot boiler room to be constructed sub-grade.  A glass atrium shall connect the original Courthouse and the new Annex.  Two walls of the atrium shall consist of the granite clad exterior walls of the existing facility.  Interior finishes shall include a mixture of granite, wood and gypsum.  The mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems are typical for this type of facility. 
     
The successful firm must have previous experience with projects of similar size and scope.  GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: New construction of office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of $15 million or more.  The contractor's personnel shall be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  The estimated cost of this project is between $15 million and $25 million.  Please note that this is only a range in a $10 million increment as required by GSA?s regulations. The approximate duration of the contract is 18 months, and is expected to begin approximately January, 2002.  The contract for demolition of the existing structures has been awarded and is proceeding.  A separate contract shall also be issued for the building foundation.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract, and the procurement method shall be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures, as identified in FAR PART 15.3, shall be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.

The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- Receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing the technical evaluation criteria; Phase 2 - Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms; Phase 3 - GSA shall advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether it is likely or not to be a viable competitor in the next phase, based on the technical evaluation in Phase 1. GSA shall inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3- Receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents, which shall be issued to offerors approximately early October, 2001.  A competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 - Oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range may be required; and Phase 5 ? Upon completion of negotiations, receive and evaluate final offers.  A formal selection of a firm shall be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude them from further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4, without negotiations.  

The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance of General Contractor; 2. Key Personnel and Past Performance of Key Personnel; and 3. Subcontracting.  For subcontracting, general contractors will be required to submit three subcontractors for each of the following trades: Curtainwall, Electrical, Mechanical, Plumbing, and Granite.  No other subcontractors shall be submitted at this time.  The RFP will contain more detail on the evaluation of the subcontractors in these trades. The NAICS code applicable to this project is 233320.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.  Copies of the Solicitation (RFP) requesting technical proposals (no specifications or drawings) shall be available through the World Wide Web the week of August 13, 2001 (www.fedbizopps.gov ).

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUOTATION NA1341-02-Q-0315                 
AMENDMENT #0002


The above referenced request for quotation is hereby amended to respond to questions submitted and the response date has been extended to March 28, 2002:

QUESTION:  Would you consider buying used cargo containers?

ANSWER:  No.  New containers only.

QUESTION:   Would you consider purchasing containers, which were built subsequent to 1998 which are almost brand new.

ANSWER:  New containers only.  Almost new containers are not       acceptable. 

QUESTION:   Do the containers have to be built in China?

ANSWER:  No.  Most containers are built in China, and the reference to China is only to clarify the new aspect (one voyage only).  Containers meeting the specification (one voyage only) manufactured in other countries would be acceptable.


QUESTION:  The standard marine coating used when repainting new or like new containers is Hempatex 4641 Acrylic.  A specification sheet will be supplied with the color card when we submit the bid. Will this system be acceptable or do we have to use a chlorinated rubber?

ANSWER:  NIST's information is that the type of paint utilized on new containers is typically chlorinated rubber.  If the container is fairly new (up to one year old), only chlorinated rubber will adhere due to the continued curing and out-gassing of the original chlorinated rubber paint.  NIST requires the chlorinated rubber.

QUESTION:  The solicitation calls for "a color chart for approval of the exterior light gray color of the Conex sea container."  
Do you just need a sample of what the gray would look like or do you need a chart from our paint supplier?

ANSWER:  NIST simply needs to approve the color.  Either a sample of the  actual paint or a color chart would work. 

QUESTION:  Line Item 0003 calls for "The delivery shall include the positioning of these containers in positions specified by the NIST Tech. Info. Contact."  
Will NIST be providing a forklift or crane?  

If not, can the containers be tilted into position or will the Contractor need to provide a forklift?

ANSWER:   NIST will have a fairly large forklift, a front-end loader, or a back-hoe available to lift and push or bump the containers into position.  NIST will not have a crane.  NIST is requiring that the delivery vehicle be capable of sliding the containers into a position that is close in proximity to the desired location.  NIST will then utilize our equipment to lift and push or bump the containers into the exact desired location.

<SUBJECT>58--TWO DIMENSIONAL, DUAL LASER MACHINING SYSTEM

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR TWO DIMENSIONAL LASER MACHINING SYSTEMS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate FAR 52.232-12, Advance Payments, into the request for proposal and provide questions and answers received in resposne to the RFP for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Question 1:  Will Advance Payments be authorized under this RFP?  Answer 1:  FAR 52.232-12, Advanced Payments, is hereby incorporated into the subject RFP. Question 2:  Your x-y table range of motion requirement is for 30 inches X 24 inches.  This dictates that your table size will be 60 x 48 minimum.  Add a CDRH Class I enclosure and you are approaching the floor space requirement of 80 x 60.  Power supplies, control electronics, camera monitor and PC controller all need to go somewhere.  Is it acceptable to rack mount these components and attach them to the working area enclosure with an umbilical?  If the work area enclosure is close to 80 X 60, these separate rack mount consoles might violate the floor space requirement, however, meet the access opening requirement.  Answer 2: The floor space requirements are to remain as stated in the "Frame and Base" section of the specifications package. Question 3:  There is a requirement that the system be able to accommodate and focus on a part of 2 inches in thickness.  Does this mean that the highest profile off the work table of any part to be processed is 2 inches? Answer 3:  This requirement states that the system can focus and cut on parts from zero to a minimum of two inches thick.  This should also facilitate the use of a vacuum type chuck and maintain this requirement. Question 4:  How are you going to secure parts to the work table?  You state that bidders shall be able to provide vacuum chucks of various sizes.  Does this mean that vacuum chucks are not a part of this solicitation? Answer 4:  Vacuum chucks are listed in the options section of the specifications. Question 5:  The specification calls for automatic depth adjustment to track the profile of a part being processed.   There are two types of autofocus nozzles:  capacitance and tactile.  Capacitance works when processing metals only.  Tactile is required for non-metals.  What range of materials are you processing and what type of autofocus are you looking for? Answer 5:  The system will be used in a research environment using a wide variety of materials from metals, ceramics, polyemides, plastics, etc.  The z-stage is defined in the "Beam Delivery" section of the specifications.   Please disregard the due date for receipt of offers published in Amendment 1. The due date for receipt of offers IS NOT extended and REMAINS MARCH 28, 2002. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on March 14, 2002. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>NA The following questions and answers are provided for information only.  They are not intended to change any of the requirements for offorer provided information in response to Phase 1 of subject Synopsis.  Therefore, the Phase 1 Offeror Response date remai ns March 28, 2002. Question 1: What types of samples should be accepted/processed in the Block I and Block II systems? (liquid/air samples, environmental samples, medical samples, samples taken from surfaces, sample volume, etc.).  Answer 1:The contractor's system needs to p rocess both clinical and environmental samples.  Sample preparation should include procedures for collection from a variety of clinical and environmental specimens, with clinical samples focusing on (but not limited to) pharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs, and b lood, and environmental samples focusing on but not limited to aerosol (biodetector) buffer, (potable) water, food samples. Question 2: What level of sample preparation should be integrated in the Block I and Block II systems? What level of automation for the sample preparation?  Answer 2: Automatic sample preparation is not a Block I or II threshold requirement. Question 3: Is there a list of BW agents which will be used in the Flyoff Test? Could we choose (4-6) BW agents for which we already fully developed the protocols and reagents? How complex sample matrices will be used in the Flyoff Test (number of agents, interfering species, volume, etc).  Answer 3:The identity of the BW agents will be provided as a part of the Phase 3 purchase order package. Question 4: Will the samples in the Fly-off test contain pathogens or DNA only? What is the expected concentration range or detection limits for the offered JBAIDS system?  Answer 4:Inactivated antigen preps will be given to all participants (suitable for both nucleic acid & protein based systems).  Further information regarding sensitivities/limits of detection or identification will be provided as a part of the Phase 3 purchase order package Question 5: Will the development costs for the Block I and Block II systems be completely or partially covered?  Answer 5: Costs prior to receipt of a Phase 3 purchase order are at the offeror’s own expense.  The phase 3 purchase order will identify those costs that are eligible for compensation NTE $50,000.  The phase 4 RFP will provide more information relating to the potential contract.  Question 6: How important will be the cost of the Block I (or Block II) system in the evaluation of vendors?  Answer 6:The phase 4 RFP will provide more information relating to the potential contract. Question 7: The solicitation mentions that potentially multiple awards will be made. What are the selection criteria and in what situation will multiple awards be made?  Answer 7:The criteria that will be used to issue multiple purchase orders is that whic h is described in subject synopsis prior to the description of phase 3.  In reference to phase 4, the synopsis indicates as follows: ‘The Government may award more than one contract for the JBAIDS system.’  The phase 4 RFP will also contain criteria for se lection.  The Government reserves the right to award more than one contract for the JBAIDS system. Question 8: Is there an envisioned set-aside level of funding for this opportunity, and within what period of time?  Answer 8:The Government has adequate funding for the potential phase 3 purchase orders.  The amount of funding for the potential contract o r contracts for the JBAIDS requirements at phase 4 is to be determined. Question 9: We would like clarification about which of the 4-6 BW agents proposed for the flyoff testing and evaluation will be used?  Answer 9: The identity of the BW agents will be provided as a part of the Phase 3 purchase order package. Question 10: We plan to obtain either through teaming or purchase, several interim platforms for the short term response. As the teaming agreement may not be concluded prior to submission of the pre-SOL, how should we  proceed (list as to be concluded, separate item, etc?).  Answer 10: The JBAIDS program is open to any technology that can meet the program requirements to identify DoD BW agents IAW JBAIDS ORD requirements.  As stated in the Presolicitation Notice, the Go vernment is looking at mature technology for the Block I JBAIDS Diagnostic system due to requirements to start fielding systems to all four Military Services after a short, less than one year, development/demonstration period.  Government program office re quirements for pre-screening of eligible offerors are noted in the Presolicitation Notice.  All offerors that can meet the Government's stated requirements are welcome regardless of technology used. Question 11: Also, how detailed should the initial proposal be?  Answer 11: It is recommend that you use the wording in the synopsis as your guide for preparing the documentation required by the synopsis. Question 12: It is our understanding DOD would like a system that can be fielded ASAP (is there a realistic expectation time frame) followed by next generation systems for a later time.  Answer 12: Subject synopsis identifies the anticipated time frame for  JBAIDS evolutionary block efforts. Question 13: Samples to be tested include: Human, environmental, water, food, other. Are these assumptions correct?  Answer: Sample preparation should include procedures for collection from a variety of clinical and environmental specimens, with clinical s amples focusing on (but not limited to) pharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs, and blood, and environmental samples focusing on but not limited to aerosol (biodetector) buffer, (potable) water, food samples. Question 14: I am developing UV technologies which originated with NASA JPL.  I believe it may offer an opportunity for reagent-less testing with faster detection times.  Please advise if this technology would even be considered within your program.  Answe r 14: The JBAIDS program is open to any technology that can meet the program requirements to identify DoD BW agents IAW JBAIDS ORD requirements.  As stated in the Presolicitation Notice, the Government is looking at mature technology for the Block I JBAIDS  Diagnostic system due to requirements to start fielding systems to all four Military Services after a short, less than one year, development/demonstration period.  Government program office requirements for pre-screening of eligible offerors are noted in the Presolicitation Notice.  All offerors that can meet the Government's stated requirements are welcome regardless of technology used. Question 15:  Is there any size limit or font requirements, word or PDF?  Answer 15:  It is recommended that your response to Phase 1 be submitted as a Word document using a Font that is Arial with a Size that is 12.

<DESC>This revised sources sought synopsis requests information needed by the Government prior to release of any potential solicitation. Details follow--please read this entire synopsis. The ONLY CHANGE to the previous sources sought synopsis is the inclusion of the requirement for ISO-9001 (1994), ISO-9002 (1994) or IS0- 9001 (2000) registration stated below. OFFERORS MUST RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS CONTAINED (BELOW) IN THIS SYNOPSIS. This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The Naval Aviation Depot (NADEP), Jacksonville, Florida, is seeking sources capable of providing Clerical and Administrative Services to include Office Management Support Services, Processing Correspondence, General Administrative Support Services, Personnel Support Services, Office Automation, and Communications Management. Currently, the Government in-house workforce is performing the services. It is intended to perform a cost comparison, pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-76, in order to determine the service provider. Accordingly, a contract may or may not ultimately be awarded as a result of the study/cost comparison. If a contractor is selected as the service provider, an award will be made in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 in conjunction with all other applicable Navy and Government acquisition regulations. All personnel of the service provider (i.e., selected source) will be required to pass a specified background check, however, this process is not the process associated with obtaining Department of Defense Security Clearances nor is it as involved. This agency envisions some work will require personnel cleared at the secret level. In addition, the selected source is required to be ISO-9001 (1994), ISO-9002 (1994) or IS0- 9001 (2000) registered in accordance with ANSI-RAB accreditation requirements in order to be considered technically acceptable. The NADEP Jacksonville is currently ISO-9002 certified. The requirement will fall under the NAICS code 56111, Office Administrative Services. If you are interested in competing for this requirement, please indicate your interest by sending an e-mail (only) to Jennifer Knoer at knoerjl@navair.navy.mil NO LATER THAN 03 APRIL 2002. All valid Internet responses from prospective offerors must provide the return Internet E-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, and facsimile number in the body of the response. Internet responses without the aforementioned information will not be recognized as valid. In addition, to assist in the planning of acquisition strategy, please respond to the following questions: (1) For North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 56111, is your business a large or small business? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small emergent business, a small disadvantaged business, a veteran-owned small business or a service-disabled veteran-owned small business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group, and whether your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act?  (4) Is your firm a certified ?hub zone? firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm currently ISO 9001 (1994), ISO 9002 (1994) or ISO 9001 (2000) registered in accordance with ANSI-RAB accreditation requirements? (7) If not currently registered, by what date do you anticipate becoming ISO 9001 (1994), ISO 9002 (1994) or ISO 9001 (2000) registered in accordance with ANSI-RAB? (8) If your firm is or plans to become registered, is or will this registration be ISO 9001 (1994), ISO 9002 (1994) or ISO 9001 (2000)?  (9) What actions have you taken towards this certification? ALL PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS MUST USE THE INTERNET TO RESPOND TO THIS SYNOPSIS. TELEPHONE AND FACSIMILE RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The solicitation will be made available over the Internet in Microsoft Word 97TM format and will reside upon the NAVAIR Homepage, located on the World Wide Web. Specifically, the URL for the NAVAIR homepage is http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm. NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME. It is anticipated that a solicitation may be released in approximately May 2002. It is recommended that you respond to this synopsis, including all information above. It is the offeror?s responsibility to provide an e-mail address that is current and valid through the time of notification. Any expected or actual changes to this address should immediately be sent via e-mail to the Contract Specialist. The Government is not responsible for inability to deliver to provided e-mail addresses. All responsible sources that request to be notified will be considered by the agency and will be informed via e-mail.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is seeking available sources for the acquisition of commercial off-the-shelf industrial non-contact printers and scanners to print and read bar codes on sheets of U.S. currency paper.  The bar code printing of the sheet would occur at the perfecting offset printing presses.  Once printed, the scanners would read the bar codes on the sheet at each production stage throughout the remainder of the currency production processes.  In addition, the BEP is interested in related software accountability systems that would use the bar codes to track each sheet through the production processes and interface with the BEP?s automated inspection systems to collect associated quality and defect information.  PRINTERS AND SCANNERS:  The non-contact printers will have the ability to mark sheets of U.S. currency paper with a unique identifier via machine read bar code with adjacent human readable information.  The scanners/readers would be installed at numerous points on each of the Bureau?s currency production equipment.  Information collected from the scanners will be used by the accountability system to track production and to associate quality and defect information to individual sheets.  ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM:  The Bureau is also seeking sources for an accountability system that includes an enterprise-scale relational data base management system (RDBMS) for real-time collection, transfer, and interface of the information associated with the bar code.  Scanners/readers will integrate with the printers to create computerized files of bar code information that the system accesses multiple times during the production processes.  The bar code information tracks the individual sheets from a production load through the production processes and interfaces with the BEP?s automated inspection systems to collect associated quality and defect information about each sheet.  The system will process, cross-reference, and reconcile the bar code information numerous times from the initial printing of the bar code until the bar code is removed from the sheets at the final production step.  Consequently, the system must be capable of real-time processing and reconciliation, comparing information from one production step to the next, producing discrepancy reports, and incorporating various quality and defect data acquired by multiple inspection systems throughout the production process.  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:   1.  The printer must be capable of printing simultaneously at two locations on the leading edge of the sheet as it is being transferred through the press.  These bar codes will be equivalent except for a sheet-side identifier to uniquely identify the two halves of the printed sheet;  2.  Each bar code must have the minimum capacity of 30 ASCII characters of data within a target range of 80mm wide by 7mm tall;  3.  The following bar code information will be printed: a. Serial Lot Number (9 characters); b. Manufacturing Order/Job Number (12 characters); c. Sheet number (00001 ? 20000) (5 characters); d. Sheet side identifier (1 character); e. Plant Identification (1 character).  (The above information is also to be printed in human-readable characters adjacent to the bar code.);  4.  Capability of printing Conventional and 2D type bar code symbology; 5.  Provide cost effective, reliable reader/scanners that will integrate with printer; 6.  99.99% readability/ scan rate guarantee;  7.  Capable of printing grade A / B bar code; 8.  Print with a sheet feed rate of 476?/min; 9.  Printing shall be done without use of Methyl Ethyl Ketone ink or solvent; 10.  Be applicable for possible defect encryption; 11.  Provide on site training for maintenance and programming; 12.  On site performance and analysis of equipment for communication protocol for ease of use and robustness under BEP operating conditions; 13.  Provide a standard warranty on printers and scanners for upto one year.  Suppliers are requested to provide written information that addresses the above requirements, along with any product information to supplement the written response.  Suppliers shall describe what modifications to the equipment/system may be necessary to meet the performance requirements.  The Bureau is requesting information packages from potential sources on their capability to provide the supplies identified herein.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  The following Request for Information is issued for purposes of conducting market research and encouraging commercial IT companies to provide information about their products and services.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued.  FAR Clause 52.215-3 applies.  The Damage Assessment Center (DAC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is considering the potential acquisition of timesheet software that will capture and report on specific data required by our program and will also store data that can be exported into the departmental timekeeping/payroll system.  DAC is requesting information from vendors whose software and technical services are capable of meeting the requirements described below.  Technical services that may be requested include: installation/setup of appropriate database engine (e.g., Oracle, Microsoft SQL, etc.) on a Windows server, database design and maintenance, training for users and administrators, installation of software updates, reliable telephone and e-mail support for both users and administrators, programming data export routines and creating custom reports. 

Responses should include documentation addressing the technical specifications of the software, the extent of technical support services available, approximate costs to the government for the product and related technical services; a point of contact for technical questions about the product; and availability of evaluation copies for testing.  DAC may invite selected vendors to its headquarters office in Silver Spring Maryland to demonstrate the capabilities of their products.   There is no implied promise that all products submitted in response to this RFI will be invited to demonstrate capabilities.  The point of contact (POC) for technical issues is Donna Lawson of the Damage Assessment Center, phone: (301) 713-3038 ext. 198, e-mail: Donna.Lawson@noaa.gov.  Responses to this RFI are to be sent to Donna Lawson via e-mail or by mail at the NOAA Damage Assessment Center (N/ORR3), 1305 East-West Highway, Room 10218, Silver Spring MD, 20910. 

Respondents must include a cover letter that clearly identifies the following information:  the Company Name, Address, Vendor's Technical Point of Contact (POC), POC telephone and email address.  If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available and accessible to NOAA for the software and technical services being proposed, please include this information in the response.  References / lists of other federal government offices already using the software are also required.  Finally, each vendor shall indicate if they meet one or more of the Federal socio-economic categories (Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZONE, etc.)  The applicable NAICS code for determining size status is 511210 ($21.0 M).  The cover letter shall also identify whether or not the software is  compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) Accessibility Standards. (See http://www.section508.gov/ for details.)  In addition to a description of the technical features of the software, venders are requested to include price lists or other pricing information including unit/license costs, cost of configuration/installation, and other special services.  Proprietary information should be identified as such.

Software requirements and desirable features: Approximately 50 users in multiple locations throughout the United States will utilize the software initially; as many as 100 may use it eventually depending on the decisions of other NOAA offices working in coordination with DAC.   The software and data must all reside on NOAA computers - no "host servers" / "host websites".  Off-the-shelf commercial software is desired.  Software that can be configured to meet DAC needs without custom programming is preferred, since this would simplify the process of upgrading to newer versions of the software.  The software should have extensive configuration options in order to implement DAC's "business rules", provide a variety of reporting options and improve ease-of-use (e.g., ability to define custom fields and to place project codes in "sub groups" for easier selection).  The software should provide a secure "audit trail" to track changes to time entries.  Compliance with the Federal Cost Accounting Standards is not required, but would be desirable.  Flexible data export options are required (ODBC at a minimum).  Time entry features must be accessible via both Netscape and Internet Explorer browsers, without requiring installation of any software or "add-ins" (for users who may need to borrow a computer while on travel).  The software should have a "client" version available to speed up access / increase functionality when users are working on their own (Windows) computers.  This client software feature should be available for users who are stationed in several different offices across the U.S.  Availability of a "client" version for Macintosh users would be helpful in recruiting participation of other offices working in coordination with DAC.  All users should be able to run customized reports on their own data (our standard-format timesheet and activity logs).

The software should allow the user the option of using a "spreadsheet-style" timesheet view, allowing users to enter total hours on a specific task for the day without identifying specific blocks of time.  The interface should show total daily hours.  (Even better would be the ability to show two daily totals, "base hours" and "other hours", as defined by our "maxi-flex" work schedules.)  The timesheet should show separate lines for different types of time devoted to the same task (e.g.: 2 hours of "regular time" on Task A, 0.5 hours of "credit hours" on Task A).  The user is to select / determine the type of time/hours (from a choice list) - it is not to be calculated by the software.  The software should have an optional timer feature for tracking total time on specific tasks.  The software should allow users to track & enter time to the nearest ? hour.  The software should have the ability to specify/establish bi-weekly pay periods (each starting on a Sunday).  The software must allow the user to enter comments each day for each project - these will be used to generate "activity logs", reporting hours and activities by project.  The software must allow a user to add comments or expand on existing comments when any changes are made to a time entry.  The software should not require comments to explain changes to same-day entries.  The software should have a "pull-down" choice list feature for selecting task numbers (project codes), showing the corresponding task descriptions.  (The user must not be allowed to enter task numbers manually).  The software should have a feature allowing the user to easily copy task numbers/activities from previous pay periods into current pay periods (a "template" that does not need to be created from scratch each pay period).

Other desirable features, issues, concerns:  Other offices associated with DAC may use this software, accessing the same central database.  Hundreds of task numbers are in use by the different offices, with some overlapping task numbers.  The software should be able to identify which office a user belongs to, and limit that user to task numbers that employees in that office may charge.  Assigning task numbers to individuals, rather than large groups of individuals, would be a difficult system to maintain.  Some of our employees would appreciate the availability of a time entry module that can be used on a hand-held device (e.g., Palm Pilots).  Many users would benefit from remote-entry options that allow the user to make time entries on their computer without a live database connection (with automatic updating/data transmission once a live connection is established).  Some users would prefer to have a choice of view, e.g., the option to choose either a spreadsheet-style timesheet view or a "day view" showing just a single day's activities.  Most would appreciate the option to customize their interface (e.g., selection of fonts, colors, window sizes, sort order for displaying tasks, etc.).

NAVSEA seeks to design and build a 21" diameter Mission ReconfigurableUnmanned Undersea Vehicle (MRUUV). The MRUUV is intended as a submarine (SSN688 and Virginia Class) operated system capable of meeting the Navy's requirements for clandestine Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and limited Ocean Survey. The system will be housed in the submarine's torpedo room with launch and recovery through the submarine's torpedo tubes. The MRUUV will consist of two sections, a basic vehicle and a mission payload. This sources sought is for the basic vehicle only. The basic vehicle is defined as the propulsion, energy, navigation, communications, el ectronics, guidance and control, obstacle avoidance, an launch and recovery subsystems, as well as the support equipment that allows the MRUUV to conduct basic
vehicle functions. Development and procurement of mission payloads will be though separate agencies and efforts. Payloads are mission specific hardware, which when integrated into the basic vehicle allows the MRUUV to conduct the desired missions. The initial operational capability (IOC) for the 21" diameter MRUUV is scheduled for fiscal year 2007. Achieving this IOC will require quick resolution of several basic vehicle performance risks.Areas requiring immediate risk reduction include vehicle recovery, autonomy, energy, and reliability. Fluid flow
 and vehicle dynamics around an operating submarine are not well defined, and therefore present a risk for both system design and certification. After launch, the vehicle must operate entirely autonomous of the host submarine. Autonomous functions include transit to operating area, obstacle avoidance, collection of data, transmission of data, responding to directed changes, return to a designated rendezvous location and recovery. The MRUUV will require a high energy density system to meet endurance, and transit requirements. High energy dense systems require safety certification prior to deployment aboard a submarine. Submarine certification is a time consuming, costly process. Previous UUV studies determined that achieving the required reliability for long endurance missions requires early and concerted engineering efforts during the vehicle design. Interested companies should provide a ten (10) page (maximum) presentation explaining how they plan to modify or repackage existing systems to develop the basic MRUUV vehicle. Presentations should describe how the company would address the above basic vehicle requirements and risks, identify any required Government furnished equipment or information (GFE/I), the proposed system integration effort to repackage existing subsystems and any GFE/I, a schedule to meet the required 2007 IOC and a rough order of magnitude cost estimate. The ROM estimate should be based on the cost to design, fabricate, test, and field one vehicle, the necessary shipboard equipment and any depot support equipment required. Responses are required to include the firm name, mailing address, telephone and facsimile numbers, World Wide Web(Internet) presence (if any), size of firm, number of years performing related work and direct points of contact including e-mail addresses. Only written responses transmitted electronically, by mail or facsimile will be accepted. The Government will not provide p ayment for any information provided in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government return any data provided. All data will be for official Government use only. A list of interested parties will be compiled from
the firms who respond to this announcement. Firms that wish to be included on the interested parties list must be able to, as a minimum, 1) access the World Wide Web; 2) send and receive unclassified e-mail; and 3) access, download and print pre-solicitation documents from Internet websites. Responses to this announcement should be received in this office NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM (EST) on 08 April 2002. Please direct all responses to attention of LTJG John J. Simonson (SEA 02612S), fax number (202)781-4654 or e-mail address:  simonsonjj@navsea.navy.mil. This sources sought announcement is for informational and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a solicit ation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. All information will be considered. This is not an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or a Request for Proposal(RFP)

<SUBJECT>A--Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW) Development
<SOLNBR>DN/A
<RESPDATE>043002
<CONTACT>Mary Ann Moreau, Contract Specialist, 973-724-2016
<DESC>The Product Manager for OICW is seeking sources for the execution of the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase of OICW development. The OICW is the next generation infantry weapon that will replace selected M16s and M4 Modular Weapon Systems for Land Warrior and non Land Warrior equipped infantry units to include certain elements of the Special Forces. The Product Manager foresees complex issues integrating designs and requirements of the weapon system, ammunition, target acquisition/fire control system, training, and the Land Warrior System during the development and future production phases. If the Government determines based on a review of the responses to this market survey that it is realistic for Industry to develop and build, at no cost to the government, three complete weapon systems, with ammunition, within approximately 15 months for government’s evaluation against the baseline system, a competitive “shoot-off” would be conducted. If it is decided to conduct a competitive shoot-off, this would be conducted prior to entry into the SDD phase. System Description: The OICW is a dual weapon system that combines a high explosive air bursting (HEAB) round, secondary kinetic energy (KE) munitions and a ruggedized compact single integrated full solution day/night target acquisition/fire control system (TA/FCS) capable of operations without environmentally caused degradation of performance.  It will be fully integrated with the Land Warrior.  The SDD Phase is planned to begin in FY05 with fielding to follow at the end of FY07. SDD Entrance Criteria: Weight: The OICW shall weigh less than 17.5 lbs when fully loaded with 5 HEAB rounds, 20 KE rounds, the TA/FCS, power supply and sling. Range/Lethality: The HEAB round shall have a Probability of Incapacitation P(I) of no less than 0.45 @ 300 meters against an exposed point stationary target, and no less than 0.20 @ 300 meters against a defilade target. Power: The system shall provide enough power to sustain system operation for a minimum of 14 hours based on the Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile (OMS/MP).  The Operational temperature range is –50F to 120F. Reliability: The OICW system shall be rugged enough to withstand military use, including airborne and shipboard operations without degradation of performance. Effectiveness: The OICW shall be effective from the standing, kneeling and prone positions. Other Requirements: Weapon: The OICW weapon shall consist of two subsystems, an HE module, and a KE module, with a single trigger and selector switch that operate both subsystems and interacts with the TA/FCS’s automatic fuze programming. The KE subsystem shall utilize the standard 5.56mm ammunition and provide a comparable performance to the M4 carbine out to 300 meters with semi-automatic operation.  The HE subsystem shall fire the HEAB ammunition in all fuzing modes. The rate of fire for the HE weapon shall be between 80 and 120 rounds per minute. The weapon will be as reliable as the M16/M4 family of weapons. TA/FCS: The TA/FCS shall have direct view magnified optic, and thermal sighting modes with an automatic ballistically adjusted reticle.  It shall include a laser range finder, an electronic compass for bearing, cant and tilt sensors, an environmental sensor suite, a fuze setter and an internal display.  It will incorporate a full ballistic algorithm incorporating data from the rangefinder, environmental and attitude sensors to facilitate accurate placement of the airbursting munition on target via offsetting of the ballistic reticle. Ammunition: The HEAB ammunition shall have a settable fuze that interacts with the TA/FCS’s automatic fuze programming circuit. The HEAB munition shall demonstrate a minimum of 98% reliability.  A family of cartridges for the HE subsystem shall be provided, including High Explosive Air Burst (HEAB) and Target Practice (TP) cartridges.  The KE ammunition shall be the current standard 5.56mm ammunition. The shoot-off: The shoot-off will be conducted at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG) by both Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) and Army Research Laboratory (ARL) personnel with Army Materiel System Analysis Activity (AMSAA) personnel providing the evaluation/assessment of the tests.  The test facilities and 5.56mm ammunition shall be provided at no cost to the offerrors.  The offerors shall submit to the government, at no cost to the government, 3 complete weapon systems plus enough HEAB/TP ammunition to conduct the test.  There shall be 303 HEAB and 5120 TP cartridges per offeror provided to the government. The government is interested only in those potential offerors who have specific knowledge with this subject matter, show insights to conducting a successful shoot-off within approximately fifteen (15) months of this announcement and have experience to conduct a successful SDD/Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase. In response to this survey, contractors should provide specific knowledge, abilities, and past efforts that will give the government the required confidence that the contractor is capable of executing a successful shoot-off and SDD/LRIP phase.  The sum of all efforts referred to in the opening paragraph may not reside within a single company.  Offerors considering a teaming arrangement with other companies should provide notice to that effect as well as provide individual team members’ specific knowledge, abilities, and past efforts. Interested offerors and those of their team members should submit their qualifications and plans for executing this phase of the program within 30 days to: Commander, U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC, Acquisition Center,  AMSTA-AQ-APD, Bldg 10, Attn: Philip Grottendick Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 Email: pgrotten@pica.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- :  INSENSITIVE HIGH EXPLOSIVES TECHNOLOGY
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from potential sources capable of providing an insensitive high explosive fill suitable for insertion into an Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliant general purpose bomb.  Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  There is a desire to move away from trinitrotoluene (TNT) based fills since there is no longer a CONUS producer of TNT in existence.  Therefore, it is desirable to develop General Purpose (GP) bombs (500 and 2000 pound class), which contain a non-TNT based high explosive fill that also meets all of the IM criteria as specified in MIL-STD-2105B.  Respondents to this RFI should submit one or more white papers providing the following information:  a) description of the explosive fill; b) the cost, CONUS availability, and ease of the raw materials production used to formulate the explosive; c) anticipated performance (desirable to meet or exceed current tritonal-filled GP bombs) of the explosive (i.e., blast pressure and the metal acceleration of the high explosive fill) should be substantiated by modeling and simulation and/or actual test data; d) degree of compatibility with current melt-cast GP bomb Load/Assemble/Pack (LAP) procedures; e) compatibility with inventory bomb components such as fuzes and booster trains; f) preservation of current GP bomb mass properties thereby minimizing flight recertification; and g) the amount of incremental improvement in vulnerability to unplanned stimuli of the new explosive material versus PBXN-109.  (If available provide results of the environmental and the IM tests specified in MIL-STD-2105B.)  Respondents to this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals.  It is requested that only publicly releasable information be submitted.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a formal Request for Proposals (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, as well as subject to modification, and is in no way binding on the Government.  Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Contracting Division, AFRL/MNK, Bldg 13, 101 west Eglin Blvd., Suite 337, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-6810, ATTN: Vicki Keider, or sent electronically to vicki.keider@eglin.af.mil.  Please provide electronic responses with this subject: RFI for INSENSITIVE HIGH EXPLOSIVES TECHNOLOGY.  Responses must be received no later than 3 PM CDT on April 26, 2002.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Synopsis to correct and clarify the original synopsis of SP0740-01-R-5071
<DESC>This synopsis is being issued to correct and clarify the original synopsis of solicitation SP0740-01-R-5071 as issued on August 17, 2001. The scope of the original solicitation, and of the resulting contract SP0740-01-D-9726 is, in fact, all non-commercial items that are sole source to Parker Hannifin Aerospace Group (under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c )(1)).  As NSNs, believed to be sole source, are identified for possible addition to contract SP0740-01-D-9726, they will be synopsized.  Any and all interested offerors will have the opportunity to compete.  Awards have been made, and will continue to be made, on an all-or-none basis by NSN.  If a source other than Parker Hannifin submits an acceptable offer, the NSN will not be added under this contract since its scope is sole source items.  Many of the NSNs that the Government currently believes to be sole source to Parker Hannifin Aerospace Group are contained in FSCs 1620, 1650, 1660, 1680, 2810, 2840, 2910, 2915, 2990, 2995, 3020, 3040, 3110, 3120, 4320, 4710, 4810, 4820, 5310, 5330, 5365, 5930, 5945, 6105, 6115, and 6685.  The contract contains options to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total contract term shall not exceed 12 years.  This is an unrestricted acquisition and the Small Business size standard is 1500.  Any source desiring to submit an offer on any of the NSNs identified may do so by contacting Debbie Mollett at Defense Supply Center Columbus at 614-692-4658 or deborah.mollett@dscc.dla.mil.

This synopsis will further serve to withdraw and replace the notice dated January 29, 2002, which advertised 48 NSNs for possible addition to contract SP0740-01-D-9726.  These 48 NSNs are non-commercial items that are believed to be sole source to Parker Hannifin Aerospace Group.  These NSNs, along with 54 additional NSNs that are non-commercial and believed to be sole source to Parker Hannifin Aerospace Group, will be posted on the World Wide Web at:  http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/corporate_contracts.  Any and all interested offerors may submit an offer on any of the NSNs identified by contacting Debbie Mollett at Defense Supply Center Columbus at 614-692-4658 or deborah.mollett@dscc.dla.mil.

<SUBJECT>NAVICP use of Qualification Requirements for Catapult Trough Covers
<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) intends to procure and refurbish a family of items found in the steam catapult systems of aircraft carriers using a qualification requirement per the provisions of FAR 9.2.  The items are commonly called “catapult trough covers.”  Catapult trough covers are a critical part of the steam catapult systems.  Usually 106 of the six-foot long covers are needed to equip just one catapult.  The trough covers make up the top of the flight deck over the catapult and contain a “C” channel under the deck that the shuttle rides during launching.  The shuttle connects to a steam-powered ram that pushes the landing gear of the aircraft during the launch.  The covers are made of high strength steel and weigh over a ton.  There are critical dimensions on the cover that have tolerances measured in the thousands of an inch.  If the cover is not in dimensi onal conformance, a failed launch may occur and there is a strong possibility that a flight crew could be lost.  This is a difficult item to manufacture and refurbish. When the NAVICP purchases new catapult trough covers or contracts for the refurbishment of catapult trough covers, only sources that have been approved under the qualification requirements will be considered for award. Contractors interested in manufacturing and/or refurbishing catapult trough covers may request a copy of the specification and drawing package from the Contract Specialist at NAVICP: Naval Inventory Control Point Code 0211.7 5450 Carlisle Pike, PO Box 2020 Mechanicsburg PA 17055 Ph. (717) 469-2793   Email eric_w_kreider@icpmech.navy.mil Or from the engineering activity, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Code 4.8.10. 1 Highway 547 Lakehurst, NJ  08733-5090 Ph. (732) 323-2150 Email nilssonkc@navair.navy.mil Due to the military critical technology contained in the specifications and drawings, a completed and approved DD Form 2345, entitled Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, must accompany the contractor’s request for documents.  If a contractor desires to be qualified in the refurbishment of the catapult trough covers, a catapult trough cover in need of refurbishment will be provided by the Government.   All further actions regarding the qualification process will be between the contractor and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst.  Once a contractor becomes qualified, NAWCAD will notify NAVICP.  At that point the newly qualified firm will be included on the mailing list for any trough cover solicitations and will be considered for possible contract award.
