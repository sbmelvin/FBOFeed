The base quantity is expected to consist of two (2) pilot production units to be used for Government and Contractor testing/technical evaluation as well as engineering and logistics data item deliverables and training.  The contract will provide for step-ladder quantity pricing of up to 60 production TATS each year over a two year ordering period (FY10 and FY11) for a total quantity of 120 production TATS.  
Martin Baker is the designer, developer and manufacturer of the legacy Barostat Test Set as well as the TATS.  Martin Baker is the only firm having the requisite knowledge, technical expertise, production tooling facilities, logistical support capability, engineering drawings and technical data to perform this effort.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for an Aerospace Structural Health Monitoring System along with advanced technical support. The impedance based structural health monitoring system should be designed as an autonomous, self-contained unit capable of assessing the general structural health of multiple material types within various aerospace components (e.g., turbine engine, airframe and space exploration components). Furthermore, the system should have self powering capability, thereby reducing the dependence on wired external energy sources or batteries. The data acquisition, analysis, and reporting should be in the form of a distributed system where each node is self contained, hence ensuring high reliability. Specifically, the SHM system should be able to detect localized damage in the form of cracks, excessive deformations, or corrosion common in metals as well as various forms of distributed damage concerning composite materials (e.g., transverse matrix cracks, delaminations, fiber breaks, oxidation and etc.). Lastly, the system should differentiate between material damage and modifications in boundary conditions.	 NASA/GRC intends to purchase this system from Extreme Diagnostics, Inc. The EDI unit was developed under the support and guidance of NASA Langley, and has been designed from inception to be compatible with NASA needs. NASA purchase of the EDI unit includes government access to unique SHM processing procedures and algorithms that are considered proprietary. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 02/14/08.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

Financial Feasibility Study For The El Diquis Hydroelectric Power Project  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a financial feasibility study for the El Diquis Hydroelectric Power Project.

The Government of Costa Rica and its national electric utility, Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), are committed to developing a reliable and economic supply of power for Costa Rica and to providing additional generating capacity to the regional Central American Electric Interconnection System (SIEPAC) grid.

The El Diquis hydroelectric power facility (Project) is one of the larger projects envisioned to contribute power to the SIEPAC grid and thereby help stabilize the energy shortages in Costa Rica and the Central American region.  ICE launched a pre-feasibility study in 2004 for this Project with Inter-American Development Bank funding.  The focus of the first phase of the feasibility study was to evaluate the best location for harnessing the energy potential of the Grande de Terraba, Costa's Rica's largest river basin.  The site deemed most effective was called "Boruca-Cajon."  Since phase one of the initial study was carried out, however, ICE conducted additional social outreach and environmental impact analysis until results determined that Baruca-Veraguas (El Diquis) was the most appropriate location.  Data indicated that the hydrology at the Project site was favorable, and the proposed site had a good capacity factor and proportionately high firm energy production.  The resulting Project is a 631 MW hydroelectric power plant.

While the precise location of the Project was defined, additional analysis remains which calls for a full-fledged feasibility study, valued at $4 million, in order to move the Project toward implementation.   ICE turned to the IDB and Central American Bank for Economic Integration as well as the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to complement their in-kind contributions to realize the full feasibility study for this Project.  USTDA is providing funds for a comprehensive financial analysis feasibility study.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $200,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 10:00 AM LOCAL TIME on March 25, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The National Transit Institute (NTI) is seeking proposals from qualified professionals to deliver its existing FTA Real Estate Requirements course.  In addition, NTI may periodically request proposers to edit/update the existing course materials.

The proposed course is intended for grantees that are or will be acquiring right-of way for their projects and for regional personnel, who have real estate as a collateral duty.  The acquisition of real estate and the displacement of persons for an FTA assisted project are regulated by the Uniform Act.  FTA also developed various additional regulatory guidance materials for its real estate activities.  The practical application of the law and the other regulatory materials are often confusing for grantees.  This course is an introduction to those issues and provides attendees with a ?hands-on? experience for many aspects of the real estate requirements.  These include appraisals, appraisal review, negotiation, relocation, and the development of a RAMP and Relocation Plan.  Additionally, the course discusses non-Uniform Act issues such as in-kind contributions and donations. 

To obtain a copy of the complete Request for Proposal, send a written request on organization letterhead to the University Procurement & Contracting address above.  Fax or e-mail requests will be accepted; telephone requests are unacceptable.  Requests will be honored if received by Tuesday, February 26, 2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), is issuing this PRESOLICITATION NOTICE for the combined development/production contract for the Space Heater Convective 120,0 00 BTUH (SHC 120K).   The SHC 120K requirement is for a self-powered, thermoelectric heater that will provide soldiers operating in basic, cold and extreme cold environments with a safe, portable, lightweight, multi-fueled, forced-air heater in the 120,000  BTU/hr range.  The SHC 120K must operate outside the tent and support applications for heating Modular General Purpose Tent System (MGPTS) and Tent Extendable Modular Personnel (TEMPER) complexes, critical operation centers, Force Provider billeting tents , Deployable Medical System (DEPMEDS), Laundry Advanced System (LADS), Containerized Batch Laundry (CBL), and others without the need for an external power supply (i.e., field generator).  The heater must burn multiple diesel fuels and operate in extreme c old temperatures down to -60oF and be equipped with a remote intelligent control box that informs the heaters operator of a problem and how to easily resolve the problem.  The SHC 120Ks unique, self-powering capability enables the heating system to be sm aller (less than 29 cubic feet), lighter (less than 400 lbs), more mobile, versatile, reliable, efficient, and is an ideal match for meeting the future battle field requirements to reduce the logistic burden of supplying fuel and power to the field. The SH C 120K Performance Specification will be posted on the Natick Contracting Division Website (https://www3.natick.army.mil) on or about 22 Feb 08.  The Government intends to award one (1) Firm-Fixed Price Requirements type contract with a base period of two (2) years and three (3) one (1) year ordering periods, not exceed 60 months. The Base Ordering Period will consist of an estimated quantity 20 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units for First Article Testing and Tech Data Packages.  The three (3) year or dering period will be an estimated quantity of 300 heaters per year. This acquisition will be conducted on a full and open basis.  As part of its proposal, each Offeror will be required to submit a Prototype Demonstration Model (PDM) for Government evaluat ion purposes.  Firms will not be reimbursed for any costs associated with proposal preparation. The RFP will post on or about 28 March 2008.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of NetApp Storage Solutions (Immix Technology).  The use of a brand name description is essential to the IRM/EOCs operational requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the services of another company. IRM/OPS/SIO/ESOC has already implemented the NetApp Enterprise Storage hardware and software, provided by NetApp, which is essential for the ESOC to store large amounts of data and to satisfy the customers storage solutions.  NetApp FAS systems are the industrys broadest family of compatible storage systems, offering unmatched business agility, superior application uptime, simplicity of management, and low TCO. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only services that meet the defined requirements.  This is a renewal request of our current backup solution which in the past has allowed us to protect our customers data in a manner that aligns with the current National Security procedures and protects us from the possibility of being tempered with by unknown and/or second hand vendors that may not be particularly familiar with the sensitivity of the product or our mission.<BR><BR>

A: The Terms Level 1 and Level 2 do not normally apply to this type of service.  The contract will provide continued specialized engineering support and expertise to replace an expiring GPS IIR support contract.  Please refer to the synopsis paragraph titled ?On-Orbit Operations/Sustainment Support:? for a more detailed description.

2) Q: Does the work require access to satellite manufacturer proprietary data? If so, is there a provision for completing NDAs with the manufacturer? 

A: Yes, the work would require access to such information.  No, currently there is no provision for completing NDAs with the manufacturer.  Under the IIR contract, the Government acquired Limited Rights to the following items of technical data:

1.	Tank Vibration Data
2.	Core Interface Chip (CIC)
3.	Cross Trap Bus Interface (CBI)
4.	Memory Error Unit (MEU)
5.	GPS IIR Transfer Orbit Passive Nutation Damping Analysis
6.	BGSE Hardware Design Information and Documentation and Software Documentation
7.	L-Band Antenna Design
8.	Waveform Generator Design

Under the IIR contract, the Government acquired Restricted Rights to the following items of computer software:

	1.  BGSE Software (All Revisions)
 
The IIR contract incorporated by reference DFARS 252.227-7013 Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software (OCT 1988)(DAC 88-2).  That clause defines the terms Limited Rights and Restricted Rights as follows:

(15)Limited Rights means rights to use, duplicate, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, by or for the Government, with the express limitation that such technical data shall not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, be: released or disclosed outside the Government; used by the Government for manufacture, or in the case of computer software documentation, for preparing the same or similar computer software; or used by a party other than the Government, except that the Government, or permit the use of technical data by such persons, if ?
	i.  such release, disclosure, or use?
		a.  is necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
		b.  is a release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign government that is in the interest of the Government and is required for evaluational purposes;
	ii.  such release, disclosure, or use is made subject to a prohibition that the person to whom the data is released or disclosed may not further release, disclose or use such data; and
	iii.  the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such release, disclosure, or use.

(17)Restricted rights means rights that apply only to computer software, and include, as a minimum, the right to?
	i.  Use computer software with the computer for which or with which it was acquired, including use at any Government installation to which the computer may be transferred by the Government; 
	ii.  Use computer software with a backup computer if the computer for which or with which it was acquired is inoperative;
	iii.  Copy computer programs for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes; and
	iv.  Modify computer software, or combine it with other software, subject to the provision that those portions of the derivative software incorporating restricted rights software are subject to the same restricted rights. 
In addition, restricted rights include any other specific rights not inconsistent with the minimum rights in (a)(17)(i)-(iv) above that are listed or described in the contract or described in a license agreement made a part of the contract.

3) Q: Is the work solely related to the 2R satellites?

A: This is related to the IIR and IIR-M satellites.

4) Q: How does this work differ from that being performed by the OSSS/NSOM contractor for the GPS mod at Schriever AFB?

A: The only OSSS/NSOM work related to the IIR satellite sustainment is in the area of Orbital Analysis (OAs).  All other support is provided by the SV manufacturer at this time.  To clarify, the OSSS/NSOM contractor provides direct support for the 2/19 SOPS crews that operate the satellite.

<DESC>This announcement updates the status of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Engineering and Support Services (MiDAESS) program.

 Lt General Trey Obering, Director, MDA selected Ms. Carolyn Goldberg as the permanent MiDAESS Program Manager (PM). Her appointment was effective December 11, 2007. 

The Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) is an overarching view of the MiDAESS program requirements. The DRFP contains the basic contract structure; an executive summary; general information and instructions; clauses; schedules; contract administration data; evaluation factors for award; and deliverables. Requirements are identified in 15 functional appendices. We request that interested companies submit questions by completing the Question Form at Attachment 18. Questions are due by 5:00 PM CST, Friday February 12, 2008 to MiDAESS@mda.mil.  

As previously announced, the MDA will hold Industry Days to discuss the MiDAESS acquisition on Tuesday, February 5, 2008 in Huntsville, AL and Thursday, February 7, 2008 in Arlington, VA. The primary purpose of these meetings is to provide industry with an update on the MiDAESS acquisition and to review the information provided in the DRFP. 

As stated in the announcement dated January 12, 2008 (Modification 6) - the same information will be presented at both sites. Companies will be allowed to attend only one of the meetings. The Industry Day on February 5 will be held at the Von Braun Civic Center located at 700 Monroe Street, Huntsville, AL 35801 (phone number 256-533-1953). Registration begins at 7:30 AM. The meeting is scheduled for 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM CST (Note: There will be a 90 minute break for lunch). The Industry Day on February 7 will be held at the Doubletree Hotel, Crystal City located at 300 Army Navy Drive, Arlington, VA 22202 (phone number 703-416-4100). Registration begins at 7:30 AM. The meeting is scheduled to run from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST. (Note: There will be a 90 minute break for lunch). Attendance is limited to two (2) representatives per company and pre-conference registration is required.  Use the registration form on the web site (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) and submit in accordance with the directions listed on the form. Contractors who have already submitted a registration form - DO NOT RESUBMIT.  To verify receipt, please call Bonnie Patterson at 256-450-1489 or e-mail bonnie.patterson@mda.mil.  Registration will be available through close of business 5:00 PM CST, February 1, 2008. If seating is filled at one site, the company will be contacted and accommodated at the other site until all available space has been exhausted. Late registration will be accepted only if there is space available at the requested location. Please note there is a fee for parking at both sites. The Government is not liable for any expenses incurred by an attendee or eventual offeror in order to attend this conference. Participation is limited to cleared U.S. companies or U.S. foreign owned companies with Foreign Ownership Control or Influence (FOCI) mitigated through approved mechanisms, therefore this meeting is not open to foreign firm participation at either the prime or subcontract level.   

To finalize our market research, a "Sources Sought" questionnaire is included with this announcement.  Companies who previously held one-on-one meetings with the MDA are already included in our research and do not need to provide further information unless you determine an update is required. 
  
Actual or potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) must be addressed prior to proposal submission.  We encourage companies to read clause H-08 "Organizational Conflicts of Interest" (OCI) (DEC 2007) in the DRFP.  Use the "OCI Form", listed as Attachment 17 to the DRFP to provide information to the government, if you believe you have either an actual or perceived OCI with this effort.  Follow the instructions listed on the form. If the government agrees that you have an actual or perceived OCI issue after review of your information, we will contact you for further discussion.

Your company may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive an e-mail notification when information, solicitation, amendments, or any future documents regarding this acquisition are issued and are available for downloading.  The MDA will not directly send the solicitation, amendments, or other documents to any company.   It is the interested company's responsibility to periodically check this website for updates.

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<SUBJECT>14 -- Request for Information (RFI) from Industry for a Launcher Test Stand

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION

1.1 PURPOSE

SSP is assessing the feasibility of developing a launcher test stand to support missile integration and underwater launch (test shapes potentially leading to actual submerged launch of missiles and other payloads).  SSP requires input from industry resources to refine their understanding of the technical feasibility, risk and cost implications associated with this effort.  Specifically, this RFI documents a Government request from industry for the plan/approach and rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost information associated with launcher test stand development and production in the three phase approach discussed below. 

 
1.2 BACKGROUND

The test facilities used by SSP are no longer available.  SSP has been developing underwater launch systems for over 50 years to support submarine launched missiles.  SSP needs to conduct risk identification/reduction and integration testing of new payloads prior to onboard testing and final integration on a submarine.  An adequate test stand will replicate the missile tube interface and submarine support system interfaces in order to conduct demonstration and integration testing.  Although near term demonstrations will be based on the 87 inch diameter missile tube, smaller missiles than the D5 missile are likely to be demonstrated.  Additionally, concepts for future submarines may have missile tubes larger than 87 inches in diameter.  Therefore, in order to determine potential ?knees in the curve? from a cost and capability standpoint, missile tube diameters between 87 inches and 120 inches, and 87 inches and 32 inches are considered separately.  These ranges are only provided for the purpose of identifying the determining factors associated with these two ranges and to bound configurations to be considered.  To ensure that the test stand will be usable for all scenarios into the foreseeable future, the test stand should be flexible enough to accommodate a minimum missile tube diameter of 32 inches and maximum of 120 inches.

2. DISCUSSION

2.1 CAPABILITIES

SSP is seeking information for a launcher test capability for development testing of underwater missile launch systems.  This capability consists of three separate phases.  The first phase will support land based testing of missile launch systems.  The second phase capability will support submerged static launch of missiles and other payloads within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.  The third phase capability will support submerged launch of missiles and other payloads in a relevant operational submarine environment within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.  This relevant operational submarine environment will consist of varying launch depths and dynamic water flow conditions during missile launch induced by submarine forward way and sea state (i.e. crossflow).  The first phase capability shall:

1. Support land-based testing of launcher concepts as part of missile testing.
2. Replicate SSGN Missile Tube (nominal) internal interfaces (SSGN missile tube is right-cylindrical tube approximately 87 inches in diameter and 44 feet long)

a. Be reconfigurable to support larger diameter missile tubes up to 120 inches in diameter, ?-1 inch thick and approximately 44 feet long.
b. Be reconfigurable to support smaller diameter missile tubes as small as 32 inches in diameter, ??- 1 inch thick and approximately 44 feet long)
c. Contain and replicate functions/shape of missile tube muzzle hatch.
d. Replicate the space envelope in the missile tube.

3. Be transportable while remaining non-mobile to operate in different test locations. 
4. Comply with Government environmental and safety standards.
5. Accommodate ejection of missile and other payload weights up to 200,000 pounds.

The second phase shall add the capability to:

6. Support static, submerged test launches of missiles and other payloads within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.
The third phase shall add the capability to:
7. Support submerged launch of missiles and other payloads in a relevant operational submarine environment within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.

2.2 INTERFACE DEFINITION

Below is a listing of interface and performance considerations.  The following information is provided to support this concept development.  Government Furnished Information (GFI) will be provided by SSP as requested. 

1. Mechanical Interfaces (e.g. Physical interfaces, Pressurization & Venting system, Hydraulic system, Heating & Cooling system, Dehumidification & Drying system)
2. Electrical Interfaces (e.g. Umbilical for Data/Power)
3. Data Recording & Interface Data Connectivity
4. Environmental (test/handling shock, payload release shock (recoil), vibration, sea water immersion, sea water pressure, launch debris)
5. Wharfside operations & Initial Missile Onload (e.g. Cranes, Maintenance Platforms, Hoists)
6. Dry Stowage (e.g. mothballed)
7. Missile Launch (e.g. Eject velocity, Missile loads, Cavitation loads)
8. Wet Stowage
9. Missile off-load

2.3 INFORMATION REQUESTED

Provide conceptual technical information, comments and ROM cost assessments (where applicable) for the following items:

1. Test Stand Concept - Provide a Level 1(Overall System) physical architecture, approach and cost ROM for a test stand that meets the aforementioned capabilities (section 2.1-1 thru 5) and subsequent modifications to meet phase II capabilities (6) and phase III additional capabilities (7). Also provide architecture and ROM cost to allow the replacement of the nominal 87 inch diameter missile tube with up to 120 inch diameter missile tube or down to 32 inch diameter missile tube.  Discuss any issues related to providing this flexibility.
2. Design Impacts-

a. Comment on design considerations to modify the concept(s) from phases I and II to provide the desired phase III capability?
b. Comment on how the incorporation of the desired phase III capability would impact the phase I and phase II design concept(s).
3. Concept of Operations (CONOPS) ? Provide a CONOPS which clearly defines the associated test and tactical demonstration scenarios to be employed for each phase.  Include the anticipated test stand motion induced from payload release. Also, comment on how launch preparation, maintenance and downtime will be minimized, and how the design will minimize acquisition and operating costs. 
4. Test Facility Integration - Identify and describe any facility support/foundation requirements and or equipment for each phase.  Comment on any desired sea bed modifications (i.e. surface hardness) to support the test platform.
5. Multiple Locations - The test stand may be redeployed to other locations to meet test requirements.  These test locations could be land based CONUS, such as Crane, Indiana or Aberdeen, MD, at one of the National Test Sites such as PMRF, Hawaii, or in the ocean near one of these sites.  Comment on how the non-mobile launcher test stand will be broken down, transported, and stored at different test locations.  Provide any known physical or environmental limitations/constraints that will prohibit the use of the test stand at multiple locations.
6. Maintainability - In the past, the submerged launcher capability slowly eroded due to the high cost of maintaining the facility or set of facilities.  Provide comments on how this platform will accommodate both periods of testing and periods of storage, and will still be usable within a short time frame.    
7. Crossflow ? Describe methods to reach desired dynamic water flow conditions induced by submarine forward way and sea state conditions (i.e. crossflow up to 10 knots) at the muzzle face of the test platform.  The intent is to adequately replicate operational launch conditions.  Describe ROM costs and design considerations for different methods. 
8. Future modifications - Provide recommended future modifications (if any) that would make the test stand more robust for integration testing.
9. Risk - Discuss the risks associated with executing the proposed development plan to deliver the desired hardware to the government.  Also, identify any risks of using the test stand as proposed.
10. Cost - Discuss cost drivers associated with executing the design, fabrication and use of the test platform when going from phase I to phase II and phase II to phase III.
11. Schedule - Discuss project schedule to accomplish each phase.  Discuss constraints that would adversely impact fast tracking the project (i.e. initial operational capability within 18 months of contract go-ahead for phase I & II).

6. Ensure caregivers are well-trained and professional and are appropriately certified, licensed, and registered to meet professional, local, State, and Federal requirements. 
7. Provide back up care centers and in-home agencies that provide services consistent with typical work schedules of employees.  Operations should start no later than 8:00 am and close no earlier than 6:00 pm. 
8.

9. Provide back up care centers that provide developmentally appropriate programming and recreational activities with planned, yet flexible daily activities that reflect the interests and diversity of the children in care.  
10. Provide indemnity to SEC from liability in an amount required by law and of at least $20 million. 
11. Provide a marketing strategy to inform and educate employees regarding available locations for membership spaces and for referral and placement services.
12. Prepare monthly utilization reports and assessment of services to ensure quality services and effective use of programming.

<DESC>ALL INTERESTED PARTIES ARE REQUESTED TO COMPLETE "RFP 02" IN LIEU OF RFP 01, WHICH REFLECTS THE INCORRECT PLACE OF PERFORMANCE. The following are more vendor questions and the Government's response: QUESTION:  Do you have the FAR that allows a physician to work at a Federal Facility with any state license. I know it is done all the time and is definitely allowable, I am just having difficulty finding the FAR that permits it. ANSWER:  A physician or anyone else can work at any VA as long as they have a valid license in ANY state.  There is no FAR reference. QUESTION:  The site is listed as Greenville NC and not Morehead City. Is this correct? ANSWER:  No, Modification 01 corrected the place of performance to MOREHEAD CITY, NC.  Additionally, please use "RFP 02" if interested in submitting a proposal.  QUESTION:  We can provide the personnel to obtain Mammos, CT, DX, MRI, etc but we do not provide the equipment.  Is this a bid for both? ANSWER:  Yes, the Statement of Work (SOW) states:  "The Contractor shall furnish all equipment, facility, professional and technical personnel services to provide routine x-ray, mammography, and ultrasound studies for eligible veteran beneficiaries as referred by the Department of Veteran Affairs, Morehead City Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), 5420 Highway 70 West, Morehead City, NC, 28734."   QUESTION:  Could you please tell me the dollar value on each soliciations? and the number of exams performed?  I know in a previous question asked you stated that no historical numbers for diagnostic x-rays are available, but do you have a round about figure?   ANSWER:  We cannot share the result of the Government's independent cost estimate for these solicitations.  The figures contained in the Cost/Price Schedule are the Government's estimate for the number of exams to be performed.  No other data is available.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted from interested sources: 1. Is it appropriate to provide a classified response?  If so, is there any  special address and form that would be preferred?  Some of that data is  already available to the Army because of our prior test experience; would it  be possible to reference the data instead? A classified response is acceptable. If they know the army has the information they can reference the report it is derived from. If not, the data can be mailed. The intensity-time curves need to be included  with the information on how the flare was measured. It should include the type  of equipment, IR bands used, test conditions - static and/or dynamic (either  windstream or from an aircraft or other test facility).  Classified Mailing address: US Army ARDEC ATTN: AMSRD-AAR-AEE-W Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000 Inner envelope: Pass to Robert Ritchie, Bldg 472 2.  Could you please clarify for me what is meant by the visible  requirement "measured with a photocell with an f1 of 3.00 or less"?  I make  visible measurements routinely, but I'm not sure what an f1 of 3.00 or less  means.   This has to do with spectral mismatch between the photopic filter and the  ideal photopic spectral response.  Good photpic filters have a mismatch of  less than 5%.

<CONTACT>Julie Mathews Contract Specialist 2083785200     jmathews@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, intends to negotiate one sole-source contract for Streamgaging Services in the Rogue River Basin Water Monitoring and Measurement Program in the Rogue River Basin Project, state of Oregon.  One contract will be negotiated with Jackson County Oregon Watermaster, District 13.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 924110, Administration of Air and Water Resource and solid Waste Management Programs and the small business size standard is not applicable as Reclamation has determined, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, that only Jackson County Oregon Watermaster possess the unique qualifications for these services for Bureau of Reclamation lands in Oregon.  Jackson County owns the high-dollar, high-tech gaging stations and the equipment at the stations.  They will not allow anyone other than their extensively trained personnel to access their stations or equipment. The unique source determination is based on the following: (1) Reclamation's mission includes management of water resources for irrigation and power generation; (2) Reclamation requires continuous record streamflow data for the subject river basins to support mission accomplishment; (3) Jackson County has in-place streamgaging recorder stations capable of providing the required data; (4) this action continues an established cost sharing arrangement between Jackson County and Reclamation to acquire critical data required for effective administration of both Jackson County and Reclamation programs; (5) alternatively, the U.S. Geological Survey could provide the required services, but at a significant increase in cost.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to Julie Mathews via email at jmathews@pn.usbr.gov or fax 208/378-5108. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this announcement will be considered by Reclamation. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials(ASTHO) on a sole sources basis to ensure continued integration of healthcare systems emergency preparedness activities in all States through the work of the Directors of Public Health Preparedness (DPHP) Policy Committee. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The anticipated purchase order period will be twelve months from the date of award. 

The purpose of this requirement is to ensure pandemic planning coordination at all levels of government and to ensure closer integration of the State public health emergency preparedness plans with healthcare system preparedness. This will be accomplished by: (1) enhancing the communication capabilities of the ASTHO/DPHP Policy Committee (2) developing a briefing for the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Preparedness and Emergency Operations (OPEO) staff on state preparedness issues, and (3) facilitating and engaging the State Director's Preparedness work.

The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) of 2006 authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award cooperative agreements to eligible entities to improve surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness for public health emergencies. The Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) was transferred to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in March 2006. Inherent in the implementation of the ASPR HPP is a strong, working relationship between the State Departments of Health, the State hospital associations, individual hospitals, and other members of the healthcare system.  Development of a seamless strategic plan involving all members of the State and local public health and healthcare system is essential to a comprehensive, coordinated response to events that may cause mass casualties or injury. This effort will focus State Preparedness Directors on the task of coordinating public health efforts with their healthcare organization partners, link State plans closer together and develop and provide guidance and support to all State Health Officials as they continue their preparedness efforts. This contract will enhance the communication and collaboration of the ASTHO/DPHP and HHS/ASPR.  

ASTHO is considered the sole source for satisfying this requirement because it is the only entity with the established membership and affiliations necessary to perform the tasks outlined above. These tasks require the experience, expertise and leadership of a national organization with a demonstrated history of working with and understanding the needs of public health and healthcare systems in the United States. ASTHO is the only national nonprofit organization representing State and Territorial public health agencies of the United States, the U.S. Territories, and the District of Columbia. ASTHO members are the chief health officials of each State who provide leadership and guidance at the State level. The Directors of Public Health Preparedness (DPHP) Committee was created to assist ASTHO members in developing preparedness activities and in integrating preparedness efforts with existing state-based public health programs. 

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirement as articulated above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability statements should be submitted within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice to Cari.Converse@psc.gov.

Statement of Objectives OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE I.	Introduction The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), is currently requesting proposals for the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of the newly constructed Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility (BGNDRF) located in Alamogordo, New Mexico, for a period of one year beginning October 1, 2008.  Four one (1) year options may be exercised subject to Reclamation's mission to include onsite Government contractual oversight.  The program is sponsored by Reclamation's Desalination and Water Purification Research and Development Program (DWPR).  Through this program, Reclamation is forming partnerships to address a broad range of desalting and water purification needs.  The intent of the program is to augment the supply of usable water in the United States through innovative, efficient, and cost effective desalination and water purification technologies.  The O&M Contract (Contract) for the BGNDRF is a Performance-Based Management Contract (PBMC).  The application of performance-based contracting approach emphasizes results and minimizes the "how to" performance descriptions.  The Contractor has responsibility for total performance under the Contract, including determining the specific methods for accomplishing the scope of work by; (1) adhering to all contract and subcontract requirements; (2) providing the Government sound recommendations; (3) obtaining proper Government approvals; (4) quality work efforts by implementing and coordinating administration, operation, maintenance, and laboratory responsibilities; ensuring timely deliverables; and (5) assuming accountability for the listed in Section V herein.  The performance-based requirements of this Contract are broadly set out in this Statement of Objectives and reflect Reclamation's minimum needs and expectations for Contractor performance.  Accordingly, this PBMC provides flexibility to the Contractor in operating and maintaining the BGNDRF.  All proposals submitted pursuant to this request shall include a detailed Performance Work Statement that describes how the Contractor will achieve the Performance Objectives listed in Section V herein. II.	Background The United States is faced with the challenge of providing sufficient supplies of safe water to its citizens now and in the future.  Factors such as prolonged droughts, rapid population growth, competing user demands, and environmental and health concerns place additional stress on available water resources.  Desalination of brackish or impaired groundwater has the potential to increase usable water supplies by producing water suitable for municipal, agricultural and industrial applications.  Further improvements can be made through research and development in desalination for inland urban, rural, and remote applications to lower costs, improve technology performance, and to manage the concentrates removed from the water.   The impetus to create a desalination research facility to address these needs began in 2001 when Congress directed the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), in cooperation with Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), to conduct a study and prepare a plan for a desalination research and development facility in the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico (U.S. Congress Committee on Appropriations, 2001). The BGNDRF is designed to provide state-of-the-art research facilities for Reclamation and visiting researchers involved in desalination research studies, pilot-scale projects and small demonstration projects.  The BGNDRF will also offer public tours and feature an information display area as part of its public awareness program.  The BGNDRF is a major federal research center, unique in that it is the only major research facility in the United States dedicated solely to the desalination of brackish and impaired groundwaters.  It is located within an appropriate environment for desalination research, the Tularosa Basin.  The Tularosa Basin possesses an adequate supply of groundwater resources for research purposes and a wide range of water qualities.  The BGNDRF is intended to be a key national focal point for cooperative research in brackish groundwater desalination since it officially opened in 2007.  The mission of the BGNDRF is to be the intellectual powerhouse that attracts outstanding researchers to work on developing cost effective, efficient desalination technologies that, when applied to brackish and impaired groundwaters, result in new supplies of usable water for municipal, agricultural, industrial, and environmental purposes.  The BGNDRF is also dedicated to bridging the gap between science and engineering, and to speed the transfer of supply enhancing technologies to users.  In bridging the gap, the BGNDRF has the opportunity to be involved, when appropriate, in studying the impact of non technological barriers such as financial, institutional, environmental, and regulatory issues. The BGNDRF will pursue its mission of supply-enhancing technologies by initiating research projects that:  "	Develop robust desalination technologies with extended life cycles that can effectively treat groundwater without fouling.  "	Lower the costs of desalinating brackish groundwater through the development of new and improved technologies. "	Improve the operational performance of desalination technologies for increased output. "	Develop solutions to concentrate management problems. "	Develop renewable energy/desalination hybrids. The BGNDRF's goal is to be a national resource focal point for the desalination of brackish and impaired groundwaters.  The BGNDRF will follow the Research and Investment Criteria contained in the President's Management Agenda, which provides relevance, quality, performance, and industry relevant applied research and development criteria for research programs (OSTP/OMB, 2003, 2005). The BGNDRF will become an integrated part of Reclamation's existing desalination research and development program.  As part of a comprehensive effort, it will fill a unique role and it will draw upon the expertise and research activities already established.   In addition to the general objective of developing supply-enhancing desalination technology, the BGNDRF will use four specific research objectives to select and guide its research programs: 1.	Developing solutions to concentrate management problems 2.	Developing renewable energy/desalination hybrids 3.	Developing desalination technologies for produced waters 4.	Developing economically viable small-scale desalination systems The objectives listed above are not intended to be totally inclusive, as research efforts at the BGNDRF may be focused on emerging or disruptive technologies or processes not currently identified. III.	Location and General Description The 17 million dollar facility is located within the Tularosa Basin in Alamogordo, New Mexico.  A central research building and external research areas are situated on a 40 acre fenced site within Alamogordo city limits and about 4 miles east of Holloman Air Force Base.  The BGNDRF is easily accessible by car from Albuquerque, New Mexico (north), Las Cruces, New Mexico (west) and El Paso, Texas (south).  A number of major airlines service both El Paso and Albuquerque, while small commuter flights fly directly into Alamogordo.  The facility location was chosen to effectively conduct activities that would support national and international research on inland brackish ground water desalination.  Because of its supply of groundwater resources with a variety of water chemistries, this site provides a unique opportunity to evaluate new desalination technologies.  In addition, there is close proximity to sources of produced waters.  The address for the BGNDRF is: The Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility 500 Lavelle Road Alamogordo, New Mexico 88310 The central research building is designed as a passive solar facility encompassing an area of 15,350 square feet.  The building contains six research bays for desalination technology pilot testing, a resource area and information center for visitors, a monitoring room, offices, a conference room, a water analysis laboratory, and a mechanical shop. The information center is located in the lobby of the building, equipped with a large screen multimedia display, a viewer area, and information displays.  Here information on desalination and ongoing BGNDRF research projects can be presented.  Tours of the facility can be staged in the information center and move through the research bay area and external research areas. A high bay area in the rear of the building houses six research bays, a workshop and storage areas.  Each bay is equipped with quick release connections so that pilot-scale research units can easily be hooked up to water, power, chemicals, instrument air, data ports and drain.  Each bay has access to three different water qualities available from onsite wells and storage tanks.  One of the bays will be equipped with a working reverse osmosis unit that is used as a demonstration unit for public tours.  The bays can accommodate more than one research experiment at a time depending upon the characteristics of the specific units under investigation. Researchers can use the adjoining monitoring room or research offices to gather and analyze data from their research projects in the bays or from three large external pads located behind the building. Researchers can use the monitors and controls to detect a failure and to take the necessary actions to resolve the problem.  Large glass windows enable researchers to view all of the high-bay area. There are seven offices for researchers working at the facility. Most of the offices can accommodate two researchers comfortably.  Each researcher will have access to the Internet, as well as use of the phone, fax, and a copy machine.  The office areas are clustered together to provide a team-based environment.  The conference room provides a professional atmosphere for meetings and presentations for up to 15 people.  The conference room will be available for small-group workshops and seminars. A basic laboratory is available for researchers to test and analyze water samples obtained from research projects.  The laboratory is equipped with calibrated analytical equipment to ensure the reliability and accuracy of test results.  Safety measures such as exhaust hoods, emergency eyewash stations and protected utility connections are designed to protect users. All on-site systems can be monitored from the central research building.  Limited centralized controls will also be available for start up and emergency shut down procedures. Four onsite source water wells supply water to the BGNDRF for research purposes.  Water is pumped to large water storage tanks where it is stored and distributed to individual research bays as needed.  Internal research bays can be supplied with up to 30 gallons per minute for pilot-scale testing while the larger external pads can accommodate larger demonstration units operating at up to 60 gallons per minute.  Brackish groundwater sources containing a variety of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) concentrations will be available for research: "	Low TDS source water o	50,000 gallon source water storage tank o	TDS of 1,000-1,200 mg/L o	Temperature before cooling tower stripping of 41 degrees C (106 degrees F) "	Mid TDS source water o	100,000 gallon source water storage tank o	TDS of 3,350-6,400 mg/L "	High TDS source water (Needs to be trucked to site from nearby sources) o	50,000 gallon source water storage tank o	TDS of 10,000mg/L or greater including produced waters Reclamation obtained perpetual water rights of 500 acre-feet per year and an additional reserve well from an adjacent ranch.  This well will be rehabilitated and brought online as needed in the future. The well produces mid-TDS source water which is typical of brackish groundwater found throughout the Southwest. The 40 acre site also contains three large evaporation ponds to store the concentrates separated from the product water by research test units.  The ponds will be used to conduct concentrate management research studies and pilot-scale testing, i.e., beneficial uses of concentrate, byproduct development, and zero liquid discharge systems.  The evaporation pond area is fenced for safety reasons and instrumented to detect any leaks in the liners.  An agricultural research area is located adjacent to the evaporation ponds.  It is designed for research into salt-tolerant plants or halophytes. One part of the site has been set aside for future renewable energy research into solar and wind power units coupled with desalination technologies.  Wind turbines or solar panels can be positioned in this area and connected to the onsite water and power networks as needed.  The BGNDRF's research building and external features are designed for flexibility in meeting the needs of any research study conducted at the BGNDRF.   IV.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for Enhanced Polar System (EPS) Mission Control Segment (MCS)

Description:

This Sources Sought is for Market Research purposes only.  The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California, intends to award a contract action to Lockheed Martin Space System Company (LMSSC) for the design, and Integration and Test (I&T) of a primary Enhanced Polar System (EPS) Mission Control Segment (E-MCS) site at Schriever AFB, CO. 

The E-MCS will consist of elements for payload commanding, mission planning, and communications resource management.  The EPS E-MCS will be acquired as an extension of the Advanced EHF (AEHF) MCS capability to provide a single XDR mission planning entity for both mid-latitude and North Polar Region users.

The EPS will provide protected XDR Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) in the North Polar Region.  EPS is the next generation SATCOM system that will replace the Interim Polar System (IPS).  The EPS program plans to have two EHF eXtended Data Rate (XDR) payloads in Molniya orbits and operational in the 2014/2016 timeframe.  

The E-MCS provides payload commanding, mission planning, and communications resource management.  The JROC approved CDD requires that EPS interoperate with the AEHF Mission Control Segment and Electronic Key Management System (EKMS).  The intent is to integrate the EPS functionality into the AEHF Mission Planning Element (MPE)/Mission Planning Subsystem (MPSS), Mission Operations Element (MOPS), Test and Training Simulation Element (TTSE), and Operational Support and Sustainment Element (OSSE) for EPS operations. 

In an effort to assess the viability of potential vendors for this effort, the Government will consider Statements of Capabilities (SOCs) at this time.  The contractor will need expertise in eXtended Data Rate (XDR) based EHF communications, satellite command and control, mission planning, common user interfaces, training, maintenance and  Advanced EHF COMSEC/ TRANSEC System (ACTS)-based cryptology that is compatible with the AEHF system currently being developed by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC).  The E-MCS will consist of the following elements:

o	 T&C (Telemetry and Commanding) Element (SMCS)
o	 Mission Planning Element (MPE)
o	 Operational Support and Sustainment Element (OSSE)
o	 Test and Training Simulation Element (TTSE)

Qualified contractors should address the following in the SOC:
1.	Describe your experience in eXtended Data Rate (XDR) based EHF communications, satellite command and control, mission planning, and ACTS based cryptology that may be compatible with AEHF.
2.	Describe your interoperability approach to the AEHF Mission Control System, XDR mission planning, and ACTS. 
3.	Demonstrate how you intend to meet to deliver an MCS to support payload testing in fourth quarter of FY 11.
4.	Describe your approach to making the deployment of the E-MCS a minimal impact upon the protected communications user community.

A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.  Interested parties must submit an unclassified SOC no later than 15 February 2008.  Fully qualified sources will provide enough information to demonstrate they have performed systems engineering and integration contracts on DoD satellite programs of similar complexity, have an understanding of MILSATCOM mission and future technology challenges, and can provide the capabilities listed above.  Interested contractors should address potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) in their SOC.  No real or perceived OCI can exist (Reference FAR 9.505-1).  The SOC shall not exceed 20 single sided pages in length.  All responses must conform to 8.5x11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  This sources sought is for market research only.  Responses from small business and small disadvantaged business firms are encouraged.  A separate Sources Sought synopsis may be issued at a later date for potential subcontracting opportunities.  Interested parties shall state the size of their business. The NAICS code for this effort is 336414 with 1000 employees as the size standard. This Sources Sought is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  Information herein is based on best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government.  The Government will not recognize any costs associated with submission of a SOC.  

Inquiries may be directed to Ms. Senah N. Williams at (310) 653-8011.  Submit all responses to: MCSW/PKA, Attn: Ms. Senah N. Williams 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
1.0  Purpose: The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information that will help the Agency define its future approach for planning, provisioning, acquiring, managing, and operating commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) services for the Combatant Commanders, Services, and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies.  This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement.

2.0  Background: COMSATCOM is an essential component of today?s DoD communications.  Current capacity of on-orbit Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) systems cannot meet the increasing communications demands of the joint war fighters.  DoD acquires commercial satellite services to satisfy operational requirements.  In fiscal year 2006, DoD spent close to $400 million on COMSATCOM services, acquiring more than 5 GHz of COMSATCOM bandwidth and 120 million minutes of mobile airtime.  The majority of these services were procured using the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Satellite Transmission Services-Global (DSTS-G) contract vehicle.

2.1 DSTS-G contract options end in February 2011 and with continued demand for COMSATCOM services, DoD has commenced planning for a future COMSATCOM services acquisition.  Any future COMSATCOM services acquisition will aim to maintain price competition, while ensuring maximum effectiveness by considering lessons learned, market evolution, and anticipating future DoD needs. DISA envisions that the future COMSATCOM services acquisition will be broad in scope to accommodate current and future service requirements.  At the foundation of any future services acquisition will be the anticipated set of revised Joint Staff Net-Centric Functional Capabilities Board (NC FCB) endorsed capabilities: Responsiveness, Portability,Flexibility/Optimization, Capacity, Coverage, NetOps, Protection, and Interoperability.  DISA will use the information received through this RFI to define the appropriate contractual mechanism for future COMSATCOM services acquisition.

2.2 As a follow up to this RFI, DISA will host an Industry Days unclassified event, at the Westin Tysons Corner, 7801 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22043 from Tuesday, 11 March 2008 through Thursday, 13 March 2008.

2.2.1 The Industry Day event will include an Overview session and One-on-One sessions, between DoD and Industry representatives, allowing for a more engaging exchange with the Satellite Industry.  All interested satellite operators, managed service providers, and system engineering and integration (SE&I) resellers are encouraged to attend.  Because this event?s purpose is to obtain information that will help the Agency define its future approach for planning, provisioning, acquiring, managing, and operating COMSATCOM services for the Combatant Commanders, Services, and DOD agencies; the agenda will be primarily allocated to government questioning.

2.2.2  The Overview session will  include a COMSATCOM Overview Briefing and the Rules of Engagement for the one-on-one sessions.  The Overview session will be held the morning of Tuesday, 11 March 2008.  A total of 100 seats will be available for industry on a first come, first serve reservation basis for those vendors who submit responses to the questions reflected in this RFI.  However, attendance at Overview session is limited to no more than three (3) representatives for each company that responds to this RFI (respondent).  

2.2.3  The One-on-One sessions will be scheduled for the afternoon of  11 March 2008 through 13 March 2008.  Attendance at a one-on-one session will be limited solely to  pre-registered parties who submit responses to the questions reflected in this RFI.

SECTION I

3.0  Information Requested. The following questions are intended to help structure a potential future COMSATCOM services acquisition that effectively leverages the commercial marketplace, delivering COMSATCOM services in concert with industry best practices to meet unique DoD goals and objectives. Questions are intended to pertain to the full range of COMSATCOM services, as applicable, including fixed and mobile satellite services, managed services, as well as any potential future service offerings.

3.1 NETOPS.
3.1.1  DoD desires end-to-end situational awareness into its satellite and terrestrial communications systems to evaluate the impact of performance degradation and outages to ongoing and planned missions.  Therefore, DoD would like to leverage commercially available operational information to the maximum extent possible.  DoD requests information to help us examine how to best access commercially available information providing end-to-end situational awareness of provisioned services: 
3.1.1.1  Spectral monitoring of all DoD leased bandwidth and provisioned services.
3.1.1.2 Service performance data (e.g., EIRP, BER, Eb/No, C/kT).
Configuration changes in equipment used to support DoD leased commercial SATCOM services.
3.1.2  The Department is interested in leveraging industry best practice management, monitoring and control resources to the maximum extent possible to provide situational awareness of end-to-end provisioned services such as notification of planned and unplanned outages, interference events, intrusion detection events, component degradation, and the like.
3.1.2.1 What situational awareness information is normally collected within industry as part of day-to-day operations?  Are there any open/industry standards defining how this data is collected and managed?

3.1.2.2  To what extent does the situational awareness information referenced in Question 1 already exist and is available to be provided to DoD?  How close to real time could the information be made available?
3.1.2.3  How consistent is your company?s ability to support this need across the globe?  If inconsistent, what is the basis and how might this be resolved?
3.1.2.3  Is an electronic feed or a portal more technically or cost effective?  Why?
3.1.2.5  In what format (Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps, Extensible Markup Language (XML), etc.) is such information captured and provided?  What format would you recommend to maximize standardization across commercial vendors and satellite operators?
3.1.2.6  What type of trouble tracking capability and information is currently in use and can industry provide to DoD?  What is considered a reportable service outage?
3.1.2.7  What construct for service level agreements (SLAs) with respect to situational awareness are typical within the commercial industry? What experience does your company have with commitments on service availability, anomaly resolution, etc.?
3.1.2.8 What Situational Awareness data would your company be unwilling to share with the Government?
3.1.2.9 What is your company?s ability to share planned outages and unplanned outages and what are the typical response times?

3.2  INFORMATION ASSURANCE / PROTECTION / OPSEC.
3.2.1 Given the fundamental importance of commercial satellite communications services to the war fighters, secure and uninterrupted service and timely anomaly resolution is a critical service requirement.  DoD must carefully consider the most effective way to attain cost effective mission supporting services while meeting unique DoD requirements.
3.2.1.1 How is your company positioned to support DoD security requirements, specifically:
3.2.1.1.1 Personnel with U.S Secret or NATO Secret Clearances
3.2.1.1.2 Secure facilities with an approved Facilities Security Clearance
3.2.1.1.3 Secure communications (e.g., STU/STE)
3.2.1.1.4 Electromagnetic Interference / Radio Frequency Interference incident resolution.
3.2.1.1.5 Certification/accreditation of information systems in accordance with DoD policies and procedures, e.g., NIST, FISMA, DIACAP, etc.
3.2.1.1.6 Tracking, Telemetry, and Control Encryption of command links.
3.2.1.2 Do you foresee any change in the future?
3.2.1.3 How consistent is your company?s ability to support this need across the globe?  If inconsistent, what is the basis and how might this be resolved?
3.2.1.4 If foreign owned, what steps have you taken (or plan to take), to best meet DoD security needs?
3.2.1.5 How can DoD best meet its security needs for provisioned services with minimal impact to industry competition?
3.2.1.6 What lessons learned from past experience in providing services to DoD customers can be leveraged to better facilitate the delivery of robust COMSATCOM services?

3.3  SERVICE RESPONSIVENESS.
3.3.1  Many DoD users? COMSATCOM requirements are known in advance and can be planned and activated in a reasonable timeline on the order of days to weeks.  However, DoD may require activation of new COMSATCOM services in response to changing operational situations in a matter of hours, in multiple geographic regions, and in different bands.  Providing this degree of responsiveness is a key concern.
3.3.1.1 What procurement constructs would maximize industry responsiveness while maintaining effective competition?
3.3.1.2 How would DoD best contract to support exigent circumstances (e.g., a critical need for service in hours rather than days)?  What considerations are important?  What impacts can be expected?
3.3.1.3 How would you recommend providing availability and pricing information on a recurring basis to facilitate rapid award (on the order of hours) under exigent circumstances?  How frequently would it be feasible to update availability and pricing information?  What other ideas would you recommend to facilitate rapid award under exigent circumstances?
3.3.1.4 What payment options have been leveraged to enable occasional use or on demand services? What type of contractual relationship is necessary to facilitate such services?

3.4 COST/PRICING.  
3.4.1 The Department is interested in considering industry?s perspective on effective procurement constructs to maintain cost effectiveness on provisioned services.
3.4.1.1 What bulk or enterprise pricing schemes options can be offered to deliver discounted services to large buyers? What service methodologies have been or are currently offered to large enterprise buyers?  What contractual relationships are necessary to enable such pricing options for provisioned services?
3.4.1.2  How could DoD best leverage its scale economies, considering that responsibility for funding and identification of requirements continue to be distributed across the DoD and solidify throughout the year?

3.5  EMERGING TECHNOLOGY.
3.5.1 In order to best serve DoD customers, COMSATCOM procurement mechanisms must be able to cost effectively access the full range of services offered today (e.g., transponded bandwidth, managed services, application services, on demand/occasional use services) and in the future.
3.5.1.1 Are there any emerging technologies or new service trends within the industry that DoD should be aware of?  How would these technologies or service trends impact DoD?s acquisition of COMSATCOM services?
3.5.1.2 How might vendors approach the delivery of emerging technologies or services outside of their core service offerings?  What relationships are in place to best leverage industry partners in delivering multidisciplinary solutions?
3.5.1.3 How can DoD ensure the ability to access the optimal service provider to meet a diverse set of service requirements, including those that will rely on technology not available today?

3.6  PERFORMANCE METRICS.
3.6.1 Given the critical nature of DoD missions, certain minimum service level requirements are desired.  The Department is interested in learning more about commercial best practices with respect to performance metrics and service level agreements.  When answering these questions, please be specific with your answers including potentially providing redacted examples.
3.6.1.1 What performance metrics are commonly used by customers of COMSATCOM services (including Fixed Satellite Service (FSS), Mobile Satellite Service (MSS), and Managed Services)?
3.6.1.2  How are service level agreements generally structured between the satellite industry and commercial customers?  How are service providers penalized for failing to meet minimum service levels? Are premiums paid for exceeding service levels?  How is this structured (e.g., percent of base price)?
3.6.1.3 What considerations are important when considering performance based contracts for COMSATCOM?
3.6.1.4  Do you have any recommendations for specific performance incentives that have achieved the desired results on current or previous commercial or government COMSATCOM Services contracts?
3.6.1.5  Would your company commit to a Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) or TSP-like agreement in a contract and what would be the potential cost impacts of such an arrangement?

3.7 MARKET CONSIDERATIONS.
3.7.1 Availability and type of COMSATCOM resources continues to be of concern to DoD.  The Department is interested in learning about industry?s drivers and plans for investment in satellite capacity, as well as the impacts of consolidation within the industry.
3.7.1.1 What are industry?s considerations and likelihood for investing in additional satellite capacity in the future?  How is this expected to impact supply and demand?  How will this differ by region and spectrum band?
3.7.1.2 How will notable industry trends, such as foreign ownership, private equity ownership, and industry consolidation affect the way customers, including DoD, acquire COMSATCOM services? What other factors should be considered?  How significant are these impacts expected to be (please provide specific conjectures or anecdotes)?  How might DoD address this with a new acquisition?
3.7.1.3 The lines between FSS and MSS are becoming less defined.  How will this convergence of fixed and mobile satellite services impact the way DoD acquires and utilizes COMSATCOM?

3.8 CONTRACTING CONSIDERATIONS.
3.8.1 Any future services acquisition must be flexible enough to satisfy current DoD needs, but also needs that emerge years from now.  The Department wishes to gain industry insights into possible contracting strategies 
3.8.1.1  What are your overall contracting strategy recommendations for this COMSATCOM future services acquisition?
3.8.1.2  Should the contract require bidders to propose against all services or elect to bid and perform to a partial set?
3.8.1.3  How do commercial customers contract for commercial bandwidth and services?
3.8.1.4 Given a possible ten-year period of performance, what are your recommendations on requiring fixed pricing or otherwise establishing fair prices at the time of award? 
3.8.1.5 Overseas performance may potentially be required in war zones. Do you have any recommendations on special contract provisions covering these locations?
3.8.1.6  What are some lessons learned DoD should consider from other COMSATCOM contracts with commercial or government customers you?ve supported?  What features limited the effectiveness of these contracts?  
3.8.1.7  How would DoD best contract to support requirements for partial (fractions) transponders and/or for a fraction of a year?  What considerations are important?  What impact can be expected?

3.9  PORTABILITY.
3.9.1 Given DoD?s varying mission locations, there is often a requirement for global portability of services.  The Department is interested in learning more about commercial best practices regarding portability of services.
3.9.1.1 How does industry define portability of COMSATCOM services?
3.9.1.2 How does industry approach the delivery of portability to DoD?  What is required for industry to ?guarantee? portability of services?  What terms and conditions are associated with portability?
3.9.1.3 Are there any innovative approaches or abilities within industry that DoD should be aware of?  How would these approaches or abilities impact DoD?s acquisition of COMSATCOM services? 
3.9.1.4 What new systems architectures could make portability of services easier to execute and utilize, and/or more cost effective (e.g., network managed service)?

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - (VA-791-08-RI-0038) This is not a Notice of Solicitation.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking Statements of Capabilities from Industry for an anticipated requirement to supplying, configuring, installing, and maintaining workstation furniture compatible with the Camino Low Profile Access Floor System.  BACKGROUND:   The VA Financial Services Center (FSC), currently located at the intersection of IH-35 and Woodward Street in Austin, TX, anticipates relocating to a new leased facility to meet its growing space needs in the next 12-18 months.  While the exact location of the new facility has yet to be determined, it is known that this new facility will have to be within 5 miles of the FSC's current location.  ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS:  Through work with General Services Administration (GSA), it is known that the leasing agency will install the Camino Low Profile Access Floor system to facilitate power, voice and data cabling and modular furniture base feeds.

The information provided should be based on a government acquisition strategy of a contract with a base year for approximately 3,000 items, and four (4) option years each covering approximately 9,750 cartridges, for a total of 39,000, subject to the availability of funds. The M927 is a semi-fixed cartridge that includes the M14B4 Cartridge Case, M28 Percussion Primer, the M67 Propelling Charge, a nose plug, and a rocket assisted projectile. The projectile warhead contains an explosive filler, an aluminum liner and a supplementary charge. The base of the warhead is threaded in tandem to a rocket motor that contains a rocket propellant grain and an ignition delay. The M927 warhead, when detonated, produces blast, fragmentation and cratering and is used to harass and interdict enemy personnel and soft targets. The M927 Cartridge is compatible with the M739A1 PD, the M732A2 VT, the M767 ETSQ and the M782 Multi Option (MOFA) fuzes.

All email communication between vendors and  the region require digital signature.<BR><BR>Note: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business  concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitte d meet the medical standards of care of the <BR>community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agr eement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends <BR>to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in t his standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further considera tion.<BR><BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria: <BR><BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted criteria:   <BR>   <BR>1.  Vendor is required to provide a full line of ankle braces, shoes (cast an d post-op), and ankle supports in small, medium, and large sizes.  Please list the types, brands, and sizes of products your company has available in the above categories.  Please note that additional requirements may become required items of supply in the  future.  Overall a complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  See DMMonline for the Statement of Work.<BR><BR>2.  Vendors that do not meet the following criteria will be disqualified:<BR><BR>	a. Vendor must have a DAPA for this product group (provide DAPA number).<BR>	b. Vendor must have a distribution agreement with Cardinal Health, the regions prime vendor.  Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health.<BR>	c. Vendor must offer committed volume discounts off their DAPA price for this product group. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices 	do not represent a discount off the DAPA.<BR><BR>3.  3.	Regional Supply Servicing Requirements :  The Vendor has a delivery network that allows products to reach the Prime Vendor Distribution Center in sufficient quantities to meet regional demand history  in a timely manner.  Vendor representation must be sufficient to provide product implementation services and customer servicing to all eight facilities in the region.  Please answer Yes/ No and provide contact information (name, address, phone, email) for  your representative(s).  <BR><BR>4.  Detail any history of backorders and/or recalls for this product group.  Vendors should provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations, and any relief or resolution which may have been provide d since there will be no further opportunity to explain these scenarios and their effects. Please include: (a) Dates and duration, (b) Cause, (c) Resolution. If there is no history of back orders or recalls, so state. <BR><BR>5.  Due to the ever increasing  number of latex sensitive beneficiaries in our health system, our region requires latex-free versions of products in this product line; additionally, products must be clearly labeled as latex free.  Please state that you have latex free products available  for your product line.  <BR><BR>6.  Our region requires products that are breathable to allow moisture such as body sweat to escape because of the physical fitness requirements for our active duty patient population.  Discuss how your companys products m eet this requirement.  <BR><BR>7.  Our region requires products that are easily cleaned (either hand or machine washed) because of work requirements for our active duty population that often result in products becoming soiled.  Discuss how your companys p roducts meet this requirement.  <BR><BR>8.  For non-rigid products (ie soft goods), our region requires universal fit (product fits both the right and the left foot) for the foot and ankle products.  Please state that your company carries such universal fi t products.<BR><BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process:<BR><BR>1.  Using their clinical expertise, the CPT will develop a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set is based on advances in technol ogy and/ or patient safety, and on historical usage for the product line.<BR><BR>2.  The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date. All email communications between vendors an d the region will be digitally signed. Each vendor will send the samples directly to the participating MTFs. Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process. Due to the potential for samples to become lost, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO that their samples arrived at the Region. We strongly recommend that vendors confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the deadline, if a problem should occu r with the first delivery. <BR><BR>3.  The CPT will evaluate each product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation will take place in a non-patient care setting, by the clinicians in the CPT.  The evaluation responses will represent a clin ical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or 'no'; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or 'yes'; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations.<BR><BR>4.  If cl inicians determine that more information is needed about how the product works in a patient-care environment, then the vendors who scored highest on the non-patient care evaluation will be evaluated in a patient care setting.  The Government will include t he greatest number of vendors that will permit efficient competition without disrupting ongoing patient care. The same clinical/performance criteria and evaluation method will be used in the patient-care setting evaluation.<BR><BR>5.  The CPT has set a cli nical acceptability threshold target at 3.1 The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.1 depending on the 'break' in the average scores and h ow closely scores are clustered near the clinical acceptability target threshold <BR><BR>of 3.1.  Below this threshold, products will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization. <BR><BR>6.  Clinical e valuations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT members for review. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.<BR><BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: Dur ing the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the clinical criteria.  CPT members will use their professional training and experience to make clinical value judgments using the following equally weighted criteria:      <BR><BR>1. Pro ducts have adjustable closure (to allow proper fit of item to body part). <BR><BR>2. Product material is pliable to allow product to conform to the extremity for a good fit.  (Products that do not fit well have potential to cause blisters or additional dis comfort to the patient.)<BR><BR>3. Product allows easy one-handed application and removal.<BR><BR>4. Product provides appropriate immobilization and/or support for the product category. (Examples include but are not all-inclusive:  Ankle braces must minimi ze inversion and eversion without restricting plantar and dorsi-flexion; Ankle supports must provide compression without impeding range of motion; Post-op shoes must protect the healing foot incision while allowing for patient mobility.)<BR><BR>5. Product has features to provide comfort for the patient. (Examples are padding, no seams or low-profile seams).<BR><BR>6. Product is air permeable (Enhances patient comfort by allowing heat and moisture to escape)<BR><BR>7. Product is lightweight  (Prevents undue extremity fatigue) <BR><BR>8. Product can be easily kept clean.  (Product can be hand washed or machine washed to remove sweat/dirt) <BR> <BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis:<BR><BR>1. The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impa ct of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization/Conversion Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (3) Consideration of SKUs (i.e. potential for inventory reduction) for each vendor.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more import ant than other pricing elements.     <BR><BR>2. Vendors who meet the clinical acceptability threshold considering the break will be asked to submit pricing for analysis. All email communication between vendors and the region require digital signature 14 calendar days from the date of the request will be allowed for responses in the requested format. Vendors that do not meet the deadline and those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from consideration. Vendors that have been disqu alified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process. All email communication between vendors and  the region require digital signature Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO that their pricing email actually arrived at the Region.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem  should occur with the first transmission. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.<BR><BR>3. The TRBO will conduct a price analysis. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a ven dor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendo r's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors  without disrupting ongoing patient care.<BR><BR>4. The price analysis will be sent to the Northwest Region TPRB for review. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible (3) three one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<BR><BR>5. Technical/company and Clinical/performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the offers become more technically equal, price will become more important. The TPRB reviews  the data for acceptable performance and price analysis.<BR><BR>6. The Designated Senior Logistician (DSL) will ensure that the offered prices in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment will be a good value considering the costs associated with s tandardization, operational impact, and regional clinical preferences.<BR><BR>7. The TPRB selects a vendor for standardization.<BR>

<SUBJECT>SMALL FORM FACTOR RADIO
<DESC>The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) intends to award a sole source contract to TrellisWare Technologies, 16516 Via ?Esprillo, San Diego, CA for the acquisition of one (1) TW-200 TrellisWare evaluation kit, which contains ten (10) next generation handheld radio systems with ten (10) Ethernet/USB mini combo dongles, ten (10) commercial grade antennas, and configuration software The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory sought vendor sources to fulfill critical communication needs in the realm of distributed operations by conducting a Small Form Factor (SFF) Radio industry day/market research event SOL M6785407R9032.  The market research sources sought synopsis was posted onto FedBizOps on 15 May 2007.  There were numerous responses from industry which included: L3 communications, General Dynamics, Harris Corporation, THALES Corporation, and TrellisWare technologies.  Each vendor was given the opportunity to provide the Government with a one (1) hour presentation on their technology as well as a live demonstration under strict Governmental control that enabled evaluations of such systems in correlation to Government requirements.  In addition each vendor was required to submit a point paper detailing their technologies to the Government before the event.  All subsequent demonstrations were conducted on location at Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) D!  ahlgren.  These live demonstrations allowed MCWL and other Government staff members the ability to evaluate proposed technologies against pre-described requirements such as communication range and data throughput. All participating vendors were evaluated under identical parameters, such as time to setup, site selections, scenarios, and frequency deconfliction techniques.    TrellisWare Technologies is the only known source capable of meeting the Governments requirement of a handheld radio system providing small unit leaders the ability to securely and rapidly access and transfer voice, data, video/imagery and Position Location Information (PLI) up to and including Government threshold Key Performance Parameters (KPP) for range and data throughput.  The technology used by TrellisWare in their radio systems is unique and novel in that their inherent capabilities do not require infrastructure based support or architectures to perform their functions.  Therefore the use of external relay devices are not needed with TrellisWare systems since each radio themselves act as repeaters increasing range capabilities exponentially.  TrellisWare is also unique by performing on a flexible radio frequency design ultimately maintaining the ability to function on frequency ranges from 200 MHz to 6 GHz allowing the TrellisWare systems to operate worldwide.  In ad!  dition TrellisWare is able to traverse up to a 9-hop voice relay with less then 400 milliseconds of delay time which is unnoticeable to the human ear.  TrellisWare technologies are currently the only systems that are able to accomplish this capability.  Lastly TrellisWare maintains the ability of a self healing/self forming network which manages itself without creating an additional burden on the user and thus decreasing cognitive task loading overall. Under the current conditions MCWL?s desire to experiment with the most technological advanced next generation command and control device could not be accomplished without the integration efforts of TrellisWare systems.  Therefore, for these reasons, TrellisWare technologies is the only known source capable of performing the required functions in the realm of command and control as desired by the Government. NOTE 22 APPLYS  Sources capable of satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability.  At a minimum, this information should include: 1) identification of your company or organization, 2) your company's or organization's assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements, 3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact information, 4) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall adhere to a ten (10) pages submission limit, plus commercial marketing information or web links. All information should be submitted via email to Ira D. Patterson, Contracting Officer, MARCORSYSCOM, email ira.patterson@usmc.mil referencing the following tracking #9017. The information should be submitted on or before 08 February 2008. This announcement should not be considered a commitment of any kind by the Government.

<DESC>The Two-Factor Authentication project to expand the Department of Education Federal Student Aid (FSA) Security Architecture (SA) will be evaluating and selecting a tool to incorporate into the SA environment.  The goal of the project is to select a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution that allows FSA to quickly and efficiently deploy Two-Factor authentication for multiple applications.  Also, the Two-Factor solution will be used only for Internet/Intranet enabled applications.  ClienTwo server or mainframe applications will not be considered.

The product selected will be the enterprise standard for implementing Two-Factor authentication.  In FSA's mixture of legacy and target state vision (TSV) applications, a future component of the solution will be the ability to integrate with applications via web service enabled technologies or the equivalent.  

FSA Two-factor Implementation strategy

The initial installation of a Two-Factor solution will likely be for the National Student Loan Database System (NSLDS) web application access for employees and contractors.  The Two-Factor application would control the request for a 2nd Factor Authentication and only make the request when the employee or contractor is accessing the application outside of EDNET. EDNET includes the Department of Education's network security, network and telecommunications design and operations, end user services, production server hosting services, and ED's intranet and Internet services (www.ed.gov) as well as maintains and operates ED's disaster recovery facility.

FSA's SA and applications will be able to interface directly with the Two-Factor tool.  The total population of employees and contractors for FSA is approximately 5,000 individuals.  In the future, Two-Factor authentication will be added to other applications with secure data such as social security numbers, loan information, and financial information.  In addition to employees and contractors, this will include other trading partner users such as school users, financial partner users, servicers, etc.  The total estimated population of trading partner users is 55,000.

The details of which applications will require Two-Factor authentication and how they will be phased in will be outlined in the coming months.

Response Dates: Questions due by 5:00 p.m. on 02/06/08 to the Contracting Officer, Robert St. Germain, via email. 

Quotes are due to the Contracting Officer, Robert St. Germain via email by 5:00 p.m. on 02/11/08.

Statement of Work
1.0  Scope and Purpose

1.1  The FDA Biosciences Library requires online web access, via IP, to a cross-searchable, healthcare reference that integrates core full-text titles with evidence-based resources and innovative tools in one site.  The web version must allow agency access with at least 7 concurrent user seats.   Web version must also allow quick searches across all resources simultaneously (one platform), in one search statement.  Access is 24/7 for Agency staff and reduces the need for multiple individual copies of expensive resources. 

2.0	Specific Requirements

2.1  The FDA requires online access to the following publications (with the current edition listed below or the most current edition available preferred) :


2.2 	For the above list of publications, the contractor shall provide the following:

a.  A site license for 24/7 desktop web access, via IP, for 7 concurrent users
b.  Customer service shall be available to troubleshoot website/connectivity issues via phone, email, etc.
c.  Researchers and librarians need access to all of the resources below and must be able to search selected resources with one query and one interface.
d.  Customers require a single access interface to search across multiple resources.  This type of simultaneous searching reduces the need for multiple searches and saves the agency time and the cost of purchasing multiple print subscriptions through various contractors.

Payment will be made in installments. The first will be made once access has been established for the first 3 months and the remaining payments will include the remaining subscription. Pursuant to FAR 52.232-18, Availability of Funds, funding is only available for the initial payment.  
Payment for the deliverables/services will occur only after and in the following order:
a.  a purchase order has been generated by the FDA contracting office.  The contractor shall NOT provide service to the FDA until a purchase order has been received.  This is considered an illegal procurement by the government.

7.0  Section 508

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

Subpart B -- Technical Standards
? 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.
(a) A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content).

(c) Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup. 
(d) Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet. 
(e) Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map. 
(f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape. 
(g) Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. 
(h) Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers. 
(i) Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation. 
(j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz. 
(k) A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, shall be provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of this part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes. 
(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology. 
(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with ?1194.21(a) through (l). 
(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues.

USCG HU-25 DASSAULT FALCON JET 
PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
ENGINE MOUNTS
 
1.0	Background 
1.1	The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates a fleet of twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel (DFJ).  These aircraft are operated differently from general aviation; USCG HU-25 missions frequently operate at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerates corrosion on airframe structures and components.  The USCG typically flies each of these aircraft 800 flight hours per year and inspects them in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacture?s (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG-Specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  Historically, corrosion damage and operational wear and tear associated with aging aircraft is revealed, which is often outside the scope of OEM published repair limits and specifications.  This Performance work statement (PWS) establishes the minimum requirements necessary to inspect, repair and return HU-25 engine mounts to service.  Inspection and repair shall meet OEM specifications and USCG approved procedures from the applicable documents in 3.0.   The USCG does not own and cannot provide OEM specifications.  
1.2	All USCG HU-25 engine mounts are serial number tracked under ACMS.  This tracking provides a historical record of repair, item location and status.  It also provides an effective method of configuration control.  Engine mounts are completely inspected at least every five years, which requires chemical removal of Sermetel coatings, inspection for corrosion and damage, corrosion and damage removal by specialized machining or blending, non destructive testing, and reapplication of Sermetel coatings.  The manufacture and installation of bushings shall be accomplished, as necessary, IAW USCG requirements.  Inspections and repairs are performed IAW USCG provided requirements and OEM tolerances from the applicable documents in 3.0.   The USCG does not own and cannot provide OEM specifications; however, the USCG can provide minimum and maximum tolerances for development of contractor inspection repair procedures.  Engine mount measurements that exceed the provided tolerances must be sufficiently documented and provided via a damage map, to the USCG and ultimately for DFJ evaluation and disposition.
1.3	Engine Mount Configurations
Note: Engine mount PNs are determined by the spigot dimensions IAW USCG provided technical data.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(VI)	Description of requirements is as follows:
The National Weather Service (NWS) Southern Region Headquarters is seeking a data backup system to handle its non-critical and non-operational data backup and storage requirements as per NIST 800-53 (CP-6). 
The backup solution will encompass a variety of OS environments including Linux Red Hat Enterprise application, data and web servers, Windows Oracle servers, Windows Active Directory servers, and SUN OS based e-mail servers. Due to the varying operating systems, we would prefer to have a non-agent based solution for data backup and recovery.

The backup solution shall meet the requirements for providing local archive of either online tapes or storage media that will allow for easy retrieval and restoration of the data ranging from individual files to the entire system or systems. The backup service must offer secure off-site data storage for disaster recovery and restoration, both locally and at a backup location outside the DFW metro area. The transfer and storage of the data to the off site location must be using at least 256bit AES encryption, with keys generated by the NWS focal point and not shared with the vendor to maintain data confidentiality. The system shall use the trusted Southern Region local network for a transmission medium, and use the public Internet to transfer the encrypted data to the off site location. After a full backup of data is completed, we would like to do daily incremental backups to maintain data confidence. Data compression a plus but not required to reduce bandwidth spikes across our network. The front end should be GUI (http) based for ease of monitoring job completions, errors, and recovery options; we must also be able to initiate recovery of data from our backup sites that may have a presence on the Internet. We would like to have the option of retrieving data both from a local source (normal restores) and remote source (disaster recovery) again to relieve bandwidth congestion.

The system must be capable of storing a minimum of 300 GB of uncompressed data locally and remotely and able to expand to 3 TB for future growth. The vendor must provide 24 hour, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year support, and provide onsite support within 24 hours. It is highly desirable that the vendor have a local support technician available at no additional charge to the Government. The vendor will not be allowed unrestricted remote access to the equipment and must follow all Department of Commerce, NOAA and NWS guidelines for remote accessing a government IT resources when necessary. If continuous access is needed, the vendor must sign and abide by the Southern Region Interconnection Agreements and the vendor technician must pass the NOAA Security Awareness on-line course. The vendor will not make any changes to the system without first coordinating them with the appropriate NWS Southern Region contacts and getting approval. 

Security:	
The contract company must meet certain IT security requirements as outlined below:
-	The Contractor shall be responsible for implementing sufficient Information Technology security, to reasonably prevent the compromise of DOC IT resources for all of the contractor's systems that are interconnected with a DOC network or DOC systems that are operated by the Contractor.
-	On site contractor support shall have a background check completed prior to coming on-site.
-	Contactor will supply all security updates and patches for the application in within 24 hours of vulnerability identification.
-	All Contractor equipment used to process or store DOC data, or to connect to DOC networks, must comply with the requirements contained in the DOC IT Security Program and Minimum Implementation Standards(2005) (http://www.osec.doc.gov/cio/ITSIT/DOC-IT-Security-Program-Policy.htm)
-	For all Contractor-owned systems for which performance of the contract requires interconnection with a DOC network or that DOC data be stored or processed on them, the Contractor Shall provide, implement, and maintain an IT Security Plan.
-	Due to system implementation a C&A is not required of the contractor system as per Clause-73.


(VII)	Place of delivery is NOAA, NWS, Southern Region Headquarters (SRH), Systems Integration Branch, 819 Taylor Street, Fort Worth, TX 76102.

(VIII)  Period of performance shall be April 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009 with the option to exercise 3 additional years.  

(IX)  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Sep 2006), applies to this acquisition.  In addition to written price quotes, offers are instructed to provide descriptive literature and a capability statement describing qualifications to perform requirements listed in paragraphs (V) and (VI).

(X)  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), Offers will be evaluated solely on price and the price-related factors referenced in this solicitation, if any.

(XI)  The offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Nov 2006), with its quote.

CONTRACTOR-MISSION RELATIONSHIPS 
 
   (a) The contractor acknowledges that this contract is an important part of the U.S. Foreign Assistance 
Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities that this entails.  
   (b) While in the Cooperating Country, the contractor is expected to show respect for the conventions, customs, and institutions of the Cooperating Country and not interfere in its political affairs.
 
   (c) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with paragraph (b) of this provision, the contract may be terminated under General Provision 16 of this contract.  The Contractor recognizes the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct his/her immediate removal from any country when, in the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the United States so require.
 
   (d) The Country Director is the chief representative of CDC in the Cooperating Country.  In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the total CDC Program in the Cooperating Country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for advising CDC regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program.  The contractor will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of duties called for by the contract. However, he/she shall be under the general policy guidance of the Country Director, and shall keep the Country Director or his/her designated representative currently informed of the progress of the work under this contract.

Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of  contract performance.  CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract.  In order for CDC to reimburse the cost of medevac insurance, CDC shall require the contractor to furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders and its cost, after issuance of an offer letter.

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

A)  To activate the water sprayer from the truck so one does not have to get in-out to turn on the water while spraying down the roads. This is just an add on that makes it safer and easier on one person doing the dust control on roads.  2. Q) What is the purpose of the dual spray heads? A)  It can be one I guess as long as it sprays 30ft wide to cover the entire road in one pass. Most I talked to thought theirs sprayed 15 ft per head so it would take 2 heads to cover one 30ft road.  3. Q)  Are the hoses like a canon hose on a fire truck or something one person can hold and spray in terms of power? A)  The fire hose attachment was to get all the hoses listed below for self loading of the tank from a standing water supply and to wash down equipment on the yard with more.  4. Horsepower.  Using the formulas for determining horse power requirements, we calculate that a 10 horse power gas engine is required to pump 140 GPM @ 52 PSI.  Please advise what the correct specification should be. Please submit your quote based on your companies recommended formula for required horsepower for a gas engine pump based on the following specs: 140 GPM @ 52 PSI.  5.  Q) When it says 30 foot wide spray capability, does this mean 15 foot from either side of the center line of the trailer?  A)  On the 30 ft wide spray, it can be 15 ft from center line of trailer each way for a total of 30 ft of coverage.<BR><BR>Attachment with descriptions and pictures.<BR><BR>All Vendor questions must be received in writing by 1200PM EST on Thursday January 31st 2008<BR><BR>Solictation reposted to promote competition.

Price will be evaluated at a 10% adjustment when lowest price offer is between a small business and other than small business.<BR><BR>
