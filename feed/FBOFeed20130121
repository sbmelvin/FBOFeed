<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the  procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on  the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-00-NIB-2197<br />Name:		Stapler, Desktop One-finger, 20-Sheet Capacity<br />Description:	Economy, metal-bodied, patented one-finger stapling design. Drop in loading, jam proof performance, 20-page capacity desktop stapler. Standard 1/4" staples included. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be  authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected  firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN			7520-00-NIB-2197<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ACI1433; SWI79410; SWI79411; SWI79412; STP-23077; STP-23078; STP-23079</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 5, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories seeks interested parties for commercializing a highly capable and affordable robotic hand. The Sandia Hand is dexterous enough to mimic the capabilities of the human hand and is significantly less expensive than other technologies. This modular hand with interchangeable fingers can be tailored to suit a wide variety of applications requiring high dexterity at a low cost such as the disablement of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. Fingers and other tools such as flashlights, screwdrivers and cameras can be quickly and easily attached into the hand frame allowing for fast recovery. The modular design also confers durability to the Sandia Hand. The fingers are designed to detach in the event of a collision with a wall or other object. This innovative configuration allows the Sandia Hand to position and resocket the detached finger independently without the need for operator engagement.<br /><br />Sandia seeks to transfer technology for the benefit of the US industry. It is anticipated that commercial licenses may grant rights on a competitive basis to qualified interested parties for appropriate consideration. Licensing options may include grants for defined fields of use, non-exclusive rights.  Exclusive rights will not be considered at this time, and licensees are required to pay an initial fee of no less than $10,000.  Sandia will evaluate responses and select prospective parties with which to engage in further discussions based on the following criteria, pursuant to Sandia's technology transfer mission: 1) What are the respondent's specific research and development, prototyping and deployment capabilities and resources relative to this technology? 2) How will the respondent deploy the technology for the benefit of national security and the US public good? 3) How will the respondent's deployment of the technology benefit US economic competitiveness?<br /><br />Sandia National Laboratories is a multiprogram laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.<br /><br />For further information, contact Sandia National Laboratories by email at ip@sandia.gov.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice. Include company and contact information as well as a description of how your company meets Sandia's criteria and could best contribute to commercialization of this technology.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<CONTACT>IP@sandia.gov IP@sandia.gov, Email IP@Sandia.gov
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories seeks interested parties for commercializing a highly capable and affordable robotic hand. The Sandia Hand is dexterous enough to mimic the capabilities of the human hand and is significantly less expensive than other technologies. This modular hand with interchangeable fingers can be tailored to suit a wide variety of applications requiring high dexterity at a low cost such as the disablement of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. Fingers and other tools such as flashlights, screwdrivers and cameras can be quickly and easily attached into the hand frame allowing for fast recovery. The modular design also confers durability to the Sandia Hand. The fingers are designed to detach in the event of a collision with a wall or other object. This innovative configuration allows the Sandia Hand to position and resocket the detached finger independently without the need for operator engagement.<br /><br />Sandia seeks to transfer technology for the benefit of the US industry. It is anticipated that commercial licenses may grant rights on a competitive basis to qualified interested parties for appropriate consideration. Licensing options may include grants for defined fields of use, non-exclusive rights.  Exclusive rights will not be considered at this time, and licensees are required to pay an initial fee of no less than $10,000.  Sandia will evaluate responses and select prospective parties with which to engage in further discussions based on the following criteria, pursuant to Sandia's technology transfer mission: 1) What are the respondent's specific research and development, prototyping and deployment capabilities and resources relative to this technology? 2) How will the respondent deploy the technology for the benefit of national security and the US public good? 3) How will the respondent's deployment of the technology benefit US economic competitiveness?<br /><br />Sandia National Laboratories is a multiprogram laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.<br /><br />For further information, contact Sandia National Laboratories by email at ip@sandia.gov.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice. Include company and contact information as well as a description of how your company meets Sandia's criteria and could best contribute to commercialization of this technology.<br /><br />Keywords: robot, modular, dexterity, explosive, hand, improvised, device

SCOPE OF WORK                                                            

This contract will provide for engineering, design and construction period services.  This contract shall replace and upgrade boilers, boiler water feed pumps, natural gas/fuel oil pump systems, heat reclaim systems and chemical feed systems.  This project will replace one (1) of three (3) existing 200 HP, 6700 PPH, duel fuel (natural gas, No. 2 diesel) steam generating boilers at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Grand Junction, Colorado.  Replacement of the existing backup generator plant and switching components shall be included in the contract.  

DESCRIPTION

This design and construction of this project will provide for the replacement of a steam boiler with upgrades to feed water systems, condensate systems, fuel distribution systems and control systems.  The supply of steam to the using services of the Medical Center will not be interrupted during the construction process. The existing electrical generating plant is also 33 years old.  It is a 480vac, 3 phase diesel fueled engine/generator assembly.  No. 2 diesel is stored in a 1500 gallon underground storage tank.  A 300 gallon day tank is located inside of Building 9 and is not contained.  Switching components including transfer switch, distribution panels and disconnects will be upgraded with the contract design.  Design investigation shall individual flue gas heat units.  A modern multi-boiler/plant control system shall be designed by the A/E. 

HISTORY

The existing generator plant and day tank are located in a room adjacent to the main switch gear room of the Out Patient Addition (OPA) of Building 1.   The Johnston boilers were installed in 1980 and have been consistently maintained through an aggressive preventive maintenance program.  The control firing system was installed in 1992.  Components for the digital control system are NOT available.  The No. 2 diesel fuel storage tanks (2) are located within fifty (50) feet of the generator.  The existing diesel fuel storage tanks are double lined steel tank with a volume/leakage monitoring system and anode protection system.  The Cummins 480vac generating set was installed in 1980 and has ran for 1700 loaded hours.  The generator is serviced by a 1200 gallon double lined steel underground storage tank.  Replacement of the boiler plant equipment is due to age and increased load demand of the OPA.  All equipment is in operation and is providing functional service as originally designed.  




INTENT

With the Design portion of this project, the A/E contractor is expected to conduct a survey of the existing boiler plant facility, equipment existing campus wide steam distribution system and current steam load of equipment and Medical Center services.  A new boiler is expected to be designed with efficient burners, safety devices and controls.  The Scope expects ancillary support equipment such as fuel oil systems, feed water systems, chemical systems, condensate systems and electrical systems to be evaluated and replaced in the design.  The A/E shall develop and provide all construction documents including but not limited to drawings and specifications.  The A/E contractor shall also provide construction period services.

NARRATIVE

The existing steam distribution piping consists of fiberglass covered ductile iron piping with individual cal-sil covered steam piping contained in the interior.  The original piping (1982) was installed with a sacrificial anode cathodic protection array.  With a historically high water table, the cathodic protection array has failed, resulting in deterioration to the exterior primary pipe.  The cal-sil pipe insulation of the interior distribution piping is expected to be deteriorated as the ground surface during the winter months remains clear of snow.  The piping in the manholes has deteriorated to a point of being unserviceable.  The size of the manholes and the subsurface location prevents economical and safe preventive maintenance and repair within the space. 

INTENT  

This scope expects the A/E to design a new underground piping system in accordance with industry standards, the VA Master Specifications and VA Design Guidelines.  The design for the new installation shall include underground piping, above surface piping cubicles, related valving, strainers, etc.  The design shall include connections to all campus buildings utilizing steam.  New piping shall be sized to meet future steam loads.  All underground piping shall be protected by a new cathodic protection array.  The design of replacement of the underground piping shall include lateral manhole drainage. 


ENERGY DESIGN ANALYSIS

The A-E shall incorporate green building and sustainable design practices and elements into project designs to the greatest extent practicable and as per VA Sustainable Design & Energy Reduction Manual. Project designs shall meet the guiding principles and all energy/water/environmental requirements established by EPACT 2005, EISA 2007, EOs 13514 and 13423, and VA Directive 0055.  All new construction and major renovations (including major mechanical equipment replacements) will require energy modeling (annual building or zone simulation based on local weather data), and analysis during planning to achieve the energy budgets required in the above laws. The typical design analysis will include a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) on three different alternatives. For example: an A/E may choose to analyze a project by analyzing and modeling the replacement of original equipment, a radiant system, or a heat pump system when designing the replacement of an air handling system.  The following are the required A/E deliverables to support the sustainable design effort:


1)	Background Research Analysis
i.	Current Report of the Dynamic Cost Model
ii.	Report of Federal Mandates Kick-Off Meeting & background Research Analysis Results
