LabView Full Development and National Instruments? Developer Suite. While the National Instruments software is available on GSA, the software maintenance subscriptions are only available from National Instruments.The US EPA requires annual subscription service to develop, maintain, and modify these systems with the most current software and technology available. These systems were procured competitively in 2004. Since these systems have been in place, we simply require renewal of the annual subscription service, which is only available through National Instruments.However, any firm that believes it?s capable of meeting the EPA?s requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 334119.  Please submit your request in writing to Noah Goldberg by e-mail to Goldberg.noah@epa.gov. No telephone requests or request by fax will be honored.

<DESC>Department Drawing Management SystemSolicitation Number: R12SS80097AAnnouncement Type: Request for Information
This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted.  After review of the responses submitted regarding this potential acquisition, a determination will be made whether or not to continue with the procurement under a separate solicitation announcement utilizing Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps).
This procurement was previously announced under Sources Sought Announcement R12SS80046, IInterior's Drawing Management Solution and R12SS80097, Department Department Drawing Management System.
The Department is looking to replace its current drawing management systems under a single award Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract arrangement.  The objective is to obtain software, software licenses, software maintenance, and support services such as configuration, implementation, and training support related to Drawing Management on a Task Order (TO) basis.
This RFI is to request input from industry on the pricing schedule descriptions, quantity discounts, labor categories, and prevailing wage determination labor rates.
Since the place of performance could potentially be at any Department or Bureau location within the United States and its territories, this RFI is to obtain input from the industry as to how to best determine labor rate pricing for such diverse locations.  The inclusion of each and every prevailing wage determination may be overly burdensome to incorporate and to manage.  Therefore, this RFI is to look for other innovative ways of pricing the applicable labor categories.  One option that has been suggested is to add a percentage to the prevailing wage determination for each applicable labor category.  For example:  For a Computer Programmer I performing work in Lakewood, Colorado the pricing would be $17.81 based on Wage Determination 2005-2081, Revision 11 plus an additional 10%.  This would allow the percentage to be applied to each individual labor rate for the Computer Programmer I no matter where the place of performance will be. Under this pricing scheme, offerors could conceivably propose different percentages for different labor categories. In additions, vendors are also invited to provide comments on the anticipated CLIN structure for the software, software maintenance, storage, and additional bandwidth for the SaaS solution.
The current pricing structure is as follows:

<CONTACT>Scott D. Yeager, Contract Specialist, Email scott.yeager@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>******This posting is for informational purposes only. Please do not respond****** This posting is to announce the release of a request for proposal for the above mentioned campaign to eligible contractors on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) National Multi-Media and education Campaign (NEC), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.
<p>The purpose of this task order is to obtain technical professional services for strategic planning, development and implementation of a national, integrated education campaign that promotes Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other forms of Health Information Technology (HIT) included in the HITECH Act, as well as the Physician Quality Reporting System and the eRx Incentive Program. Efforts are currently under way to better align the EHR Incentive Program with both the Physician Quality Reporting System and the eRx Incentive Program. The campaign shall educate health care providers eligible for the incentive programs and Medicare and Medicaid consumers on the importance of Health IT and how it leads to a more efficient and transparent health system through lower costs and increased quality, encouraging registration and successful attestation in the program to avoid payment adjustments in the incentives. Primarily, the campaign shall increase provider knowledge of the HITECH EHR Incentive Program, the Physician Quality Reporting System, and the eRx Incentive Program. As a secondary effort, consumer awareness of the upcoming trend toward EHR/eRx use and quality reporting by providers will be conveyed and trust of such technology shall be built into the campaign by instilling the importance of privacy and how their personal information will be protected in the adoption of Health IT. The campaign shall also educate and collaborate with state leadership and state associations to assure states are equipped with the necessary information to promote, support, and administer the HITECH incentive program to Medicaid providers, advance statewide HIT infrastructure and meet the Health Information Exchange (HIE) meaningful use criteria established by the Secretary through the rule-making process.</p>
<p>This task order is expected to be completed within 12 months of award.</p>

<CONTACT>Brian Holloway, Dr. , Email DARPA-BAA-12-43@darpa.mil
<DESC>The goal of the Local Control of Materials Synthesis (LoCo) program is to develop a low-temperature process for the deposition of thin films whose current minimum processing temperature exceeds the maximum temperature substrates of interest to the Department of Defense (DoD) can withstand (e.g., chemical vapor deposited diamond on polymers).  To achieve this goal, DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals that independently develop novel chemical and physical processes to meet the energetic/chemical requirements of thin film deposition (e.g., reactant flux, surface mobility, reaction energy, etc.), without reliance on broadband temperature input used in state-of-the-art chemical vapor deposition.  Complementary, successful methods will then be integrated by DARPA to deposit a DoD-relevant thin film (e.g., optically clear diamond) on a DoD substrate of interest (e.g., zinc sulfide).  Non-traditional performers outside of the materials research/thin film deposition communities in areas such as surface acoustic wave spectroscopy, plasma physics, photochemistry, etc. are highly encouraged to submit proposals to the LoCo program.  To facilitate technology transfer, DARPA is also seeking input on DoD systems and parts that could benefit from success in the LoCo program.

<DESC>The FAA is pursuing the issuance of an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) for the redesign or optimization of an aircraft hand-held fire extinguisher to replace the portable Halon 1211 fire extinguishers currently utilized on civilian transport aircraft. The desired outcome is the lightest, smallest volume, and most practical canister design that will contain an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved streaming agent on the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) list to replace Halon 1211.
Substitutes for Halon 1211 include the following:  HCFC-123 (FE-232); HCF-124 (FE-241); (HCFC Blend) B (Halotron 1); (HCFC Blend) C (NAF P-III); (HCFC Blend) D (Blitz III); (HCFC Blend) E (NAF P-IV); HFC-227ea (FM 200); HFC-236fa (FE-36); and C6-perfluoroketone (Novec 1230).  In addition, this research effort includes any agents that have made application to the EPA's streaming agent SNAP list.
The FAA will evaluate proposed alternatives for the portable Halon 1211 fire extinguishers based on the ability to meet various performance, environmental, and aircraft compatibility standards deemed essential by the FAA.

<a href="mailto:Jane.L.Thomas@nasa.gov">Jane L Thomas</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for an Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) forthe early Space Launch System (SLS) missions. The early flights of the SLS architecturewill require the use of an ICPS to ensure the placement of the Orion Multi-Purpose CrewVehicle (MPCV) and/or payload on the required trajectory. In order to support the flightschedule, the initial ICPS flight unit must be delivered to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) nolater than late in the fourth quarter of the 2016 government fiscal year (GFY). Thesecond flight unit must be delivered to KSC by the fourth quarter of the 2020 GFY. Designparameters/ performance characteristics for the ICPS are as follows: 1. Human Rated per NPR 8705.2B, Human-Rating for Space Systems (at a minimum the secondflight unit will be human rated); 2. Burns (accelerating MPCV) following placement of ICPS and MPCV at 975 x -50 nmiinsertion point by the SLS Launch Vehicle -- three engine ignitions to achieve greaterthan 3050 m/s delta-V; 3. Lift Capability -- total weight of 53404 lbs which includes crew module, servicemodule, and crew; 4. Mass -- less than 71400 lbs.; 5. Length -- packaged, as stacked, within 500"; 6. Functional Capability -- perform a separation event and have three-axis attitudecontrol after SLS insertion and prior to separation from MPCV; 7. Constraints -- axial acceleration, during stage burns, not to exceed 2g; and 8. Reference Missions -- support MPCV free lunar return without crew and MPCV High LunarOrbit (HLO) with crew. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the labor and hardware necessary to meet the requirementsdescribed above from The Boeing Company (Boeing). To fulfill these requirements, Boeingwill modify its existing Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS). As a result of internalmarket research that looked at available in-space propulsion capabilities in the UnitedStates, Europe, and Japan, NASA determined that the DCSS, with minor modifications, wascapable of fulfilling the SLS needs. This market research was validated by the results ofa sources sought synopsis published on January 9, 2012. Based on the responses to thatsources sought synopsis, NASA determined that the DCSS is the only means available tosupport the immediate in-space propulsion needs of the SLS within the SLS manifestschedule constraints. The DCSS is the only known in-space stage requiring relativelyminor modifications to enable full compliance with the requirements of the early SLSmanifest. As currently designed, the DCSS meets all requirements noted above except HumanRating and delta-V. It has the means to be human ratable, since with the minormodifications it can be human rated by the second flight unit.	No other in-spacepropulsion stage (either existing with proven flight performance, or planned) requiressuch relatively minor modifications to be made fully compliant with the SLS requirements.Boeing maintains the data rights to the DCSS.  Boeing maintains the unique and specificdesign and testing knowledge/skills required to affect the types of modifications to theDCSS necessary to enable full compliance with the requirements of the early SLS manifest.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation whichshall be considered by the agency. Interested organizations may submit their capabilitiesand qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contactnot later than 4:30 p.m. Central time on May 18, 2012. Such submissions concerningcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisition (OA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1975 to procure services for whole genome sequencing (human):</p>
<p>1. Whole Genome Sequencing (Human), 30X Coverage from short-insert paired end reads, Catalog Number: FT-700-2030, Samples: Six (6); and<br /><br />2. Whole Genome Sequencing (Human), 100-120Gb data generated, from short-insert paired end reads, Catalog Number: FT-701-2030, Samples: Six (6).</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. The program was organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical Center. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. UDP clinical researchers are using advances in DNA sequencing to detect defects in genes that point to known disorders. These tools offer the potential for discoveries about the role of molecular and biochemical events that can cause disease and, eventually, the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for rare and common diseases. Medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program. Of the total number of cases that are referred to this program, a very limited number will be invited to proceed in the study following careful application review by the program's medical team. In general, it takes 8 to 12 weeks for the UDP to evaluate an application, and the waiting list for admission is 2 to 6 months.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide Whole Genome Sequencing (Human), 30X Coverage, from short-insert paired end reads. This package includes consensus sequence from ELAND alignment and called SNPs. This is built using short insert paired end reads only, with at least 30X average sequence coverage. One library will be created per each genome sampled. The delivered dataset will include all reads and quality scores for further downstream analysis. A minimum of 5ug input DNA is needed to perform this service.</p>
<p>The Contractor (Illumina Genome Network) links researchers interested in conducting large whole human genome sequencing projects with leading institutes worldwide that provide highly economical and rapid turnaround access to Illumina sequencing. Consisting of CSPro-certified organizations with proven expertise in generating high-quality, economical human genome data, the Illumina Genome Network enables researchers to complete their genome sequencing projects rapidly and confidently.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Key Illumina Genome Network differentiators</strong></span></p>
<p>1. Full service (from sample prep to simplified data analysis) is provided by Illumina or one of its Network Partners:<br />a. Extensive NGS expertise (CSPro-certified, published, owns 10+ ILMN systems for production-level sequencing capacity);<br />b. Data Analysis is performed using CASAVA 1.8 (consensus sequence from ELAND alignment, called SNPs and indels);<br />c. Concordance with whole-genome genotyping arrays (genotype concordance of 99.5% for non-cancer samples); <br />d. Higher coverage offerings (from 30x to 200x); and <br />e. Data Quality: &gt;80% of all reads passing filter have a Q value of Q30 or greater.</p>
<p>2. Illumina Genome Network receives ongoing Informatics and Services improvements from Illumina, which are cycled into our services groups when upgrades are proven to be technically and commercially feasible<br />a. By way of example, the Services group has continually upgraded CASAVA and has replaced the Omni1.0 with the Omni2.5 (orthogonal validation). Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology and the Business Size Standard is 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-58 April 18, 2012). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by May 7, 2012, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.<br /><br />Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2012-139-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell. Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) for the Office of Research and Development (ORD) to provide professional development workshops on clarity in written scientific communication.  The EPA intends to issue a firm fixed price Purchase Order, inclusive of all travel costs, fees, and materials, resulting from the solicitation for this requirement.
Prospective sources are reminded that an award can only be made to a vendor who is registered and in "active status" in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Registration in CCR requires a DUNS number, which can be obtained for free.  More information regarding the CCR registration process and requirements can be found on www.ccr.gov. 
The RFQ will be posted on or about May 18, 2012 at the following site:http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/sapcbd/workshop.htm
The draft Statement of Work is outlined below:
I.  Background and Objectives
The National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCER) is responsible for writing many of the highly influential documents produced by the EPA?s ORD, including documents that provide the results of the health assessments of priority environmental contaminants needed by EPA?s programs and Regions to carry out their legislative mandates.  Examples of NCEA written products are the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) and Provisional Peer Reviewed Toxicity Values (PPRTVs).  IRIS assessments and PPRTVs provide EPA with hazard identification and toxicity values derived from quantitative dose-response assessment.  These and other high priority documents are integral to ORD's human health risk assessment multi-year plan, producing peer-reviewed products used extensively by EPA programs, regional offices, and other parties to determine the potential risk to public health from exposure to environmental contaminants. Given the importance and high visibility of these documents, acc urate and clear written scientific communication is imperative to their success.  As a result, NCEA has a requirement for scientific and managerial training and feedback on written communication that will improve the clarity and overall effectiveness of NCEA?s technical documents.
II.  Scope and Tasks
In consultation with the EPA Contracting Officer Representative(s) (COR), the vendor shall conduct two, 3-day advanced scientific writing workshops for 12-15 people at two locations (Washington, DC and Cincinnati, OH) during August through December 2012, the exact dates of the training to be determined by EPA and provided to the vendor at least 30 days prior to the proposed workshop.  
The workshop should consist of both group lecture time and small group (both private individual mentoring and 1 to 2 individuals at a time) mentoring and writing critiques.  The focus of the workshop should be on clarity and in written scientific communication. 
Optional Task.  At the unilateral discretion of the government, two additional workshops (to be held shortly after the first workshop series) for 12-15 people each will be scheduled within six weeks of commencement of the option period.  The scope and content of these two additional workshops is the same as that described in Task 1 above.  However, the workshops will be held only in Washington, DC.
III.  Delivery Schedule
The Contractor shall be responsible for delivering all written materials and professional services in accordance with the following proposed time schedule:
Conduct two advanced scientific writing workshop including private mentoring sessions and 1-2 group sessions at a date TBD via technical direction provided by the COR(s).
Optional Task . Conduct two additional advanced writing workshops including private mentoring sessions and 1-2 group sessions at a date TBD via technical direction provided by the COR(s)
III.  Management Control Procedures
The EPA has determined that activities related to this contract come under the definition of advisory and assistance services and, as such, additional management controls have been added.  The COR(s) is responsible for assuring compliance.  All clarification and technical discussion between the EPA COR(s) and the vendor will be documented with email and/or other written correspondence.  The vendor is required to report on prior contracts and current work that may present a conflict of interest at any time the conflict is known.  These control measures will ensure that no activity is performed or products released without prior review and approval by the EPA COR(s).

<p>Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency of other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer of as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202-475-3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) Bureau for Global Health (GH) in Washington DC will be seeking contractor services to provide the Bureau for Global Health with grants solicitation, management services and technical support to a new program that is expected to be awarded by September 30, 2012.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates the award of one (1) contract to a qualified 8(a) firm with a total estimated cost of $13 million. This will be a 5 year Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract. The Contractor will be required to administer grant solicitation, monitoring, and overall management of the Child Blindness Grant Program (CBGP) in accordance with USAID grant rules, regulations, processes and procedures to support the Child Blindness Program goals and objectives.</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor will be required to provide technical assistance, conduct monitoring and evaluation, support communication efforts, and develop systems and procedures to facilitate the financial management and procurement needs of grant recipients as needed.</p>
<p>This five-year program will provide a contractor with funding to help select and support U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based organizations to receive competitive grants that expand the delivery of quality eye care services to vulnerable children and other populations with limited access to sight-saving services. It will implement the Congressionally-mandated child blindness directive which features prominently in USAID's multi-faceted approach to the eradication of preventable blindness.</p>
<p>This program will build upon the program successes and lessons learned from the USAID Child Blindness Eye Health and Grants Fund 2005-2011 which employed a competitive grants-making process that prioritized the delivery of high-impact services in underserved communities across Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. The new USAID Child Blindness Program (CBGP) will emphasize a service delivery focus, cultivate a learning agenda, and build the capacity of local organizations to implement large-scale pediatric eye care programs.</p>
<p>Offerors must be certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information<br><br>Subject: Request for Information<br><br>On-the-Spot/Field Solutions to Soldier Camouflage <br> <br>The Multifunctional Materials Team, Warfighter Science, Technology and Research Directorate at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Natick, MA has a need to identify possible quick-fix solutions that provide on-the-spot Soldier camouflage improvements for Soldiers deployed in current and future Military Operating Environments.  These solutions will have the capability to adjust camouflage uniforms and Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE) in-the-field to provide enhanced performance in specific sites of conflict.  This capability will allow for an expedient alternative to the current process of typically waiting months for specific printed camouflage material to be fabricated into uniforms.<br><br>Current and future uniforms worn by US Soldiers will provide camouflage properties in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions for a generalized terrain (Wooded, Arid, and Transitional).  Although colors and patterns of fielded camouflage uniforms will provide effective blending in a generalized terrain, specific areas of conflict may depart from the generalized terrain due to particular vegetation, amount of rainfall, or seasonal changes.  The government is conducting a market investigation for on-the-spot/field solutions that can be applied to the baseline uniform that will provide for better visual/near-infrared blending for specific areas. This request for information to industry is not to provide new camouflage colors and/or patterns for specific regions, but to identify possible field quick-fixes for Soldiers to adjust their current uniform for mission specific areas of conflict.  These solutions should not adversely affect the fabric performance specifications in MIL-DTL-44436A or its associated performance specification.  Technologies/capabilities shall meet the following critical performance requirements: (1) Provide visual camouflage in a range of typical military colors so that Soldiers can adapt their uniforms and PPE to complement an assortment of specific terrains, (2) Provide a break-up of near infrared spectral region with at least 3 distinct levels of reflectance, (3) Be easily applied to and removed from the current uniform and PPE by Soldiers in the field, and (4) after application, not be flammable or reduce the flame resistance of current uniform materials.  <br><br>Respondents should describe their submitted technology/capability and identify the level and type of camouflage protection offered (e.g., sensor types and/or terrains addressed, environmental effects, etc.) within thirty (30) days following the publication of this synopsis.  Information should include, but not be limited to, technical test data (e.g. physical properties/performance characteristics, test methodology (e.g. ASTM and AATCC), certification/compliance, status and specifications for manufacturing and production, any unique or proprietary construction requirements related to the technology, costs, relevant company background/experience, and any other information that the respondent believes demonstrates the value of their technology/solution and the ability to meet the aforementioned desired performance.  Any textile-based offers are cautioned that their products (all materials and manufacturing) must comply with Berry Amendment Restrictions (see DFARS 252.225-7012).  <br><br>For developmental products, include estimates of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) as defined in the cover sheet. Respondents shall complete a separate questionnaire contained in the cover sheet at the end of this document and submit it with their response.<br><br>The government will assess submissions and may choose to perform independent physical and other testing to determine the best performing material/solution available. As such, companies may be contacted for additional information or asked to submit samples for further consideration. Companies may request only the test results regarding their own materials.<br><br>This RFI is solely for information purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any information/samples submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the government for such information/samples. Any testing results will be controlled and used for governmental purposes only. <br><br>Responses to this notice are to be sent to Mrs. Anabela Dugas or Mr. James Fairneny, Multifunctional Materials Team, ATTN:  RDNS-WSD-M, 15 Kansas St., Natick, MA 01760-5019.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID, REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), OR OTHER SOLICITATION, AND IN NO WAY OBLIGATES CMS TO AWARD A CONTRACT. THE SOLE INTENT OF THIS SSN IS TO OBTAIN CAPABILITY STATEMENTS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE IF 8(A) SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO PERFORM AS A HEALTHCARE ORACLE HOSTING &amp; OPERATION CONTRACTOR (HOHOC), CURRENTLY SIMILAR WORK IS BEING DONE FOR CMS BY AN 8(A) SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES CONTRACTOR. CMS NEEDS TO IDENTIFY IF THERE ARE SUFFICIENT 8(A) SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES TO RECOMPETE THIS EFFORT AS AN 8(A) SMALL DISADVANTAGE BUSINESS SET-ASIDE AND THAT ENTITIES ARE CAPABLE OF COMPLETING THE STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW). THIS WILL FACILITATE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR PROCURING THESE SERVICES.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The work solicited includes the infrastructure support for the HCQIS environments which uses shared database servers and Wide Area Network (WAN) resources to monitor and improve utilization and quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid Beneficiaries. QualityNet resources are geographically dispersed; Complex 1 located at the CMS Central Office Data Center in Baltimore, MD and Complex 2 which is located at the HCQIS Infrastructure Contractor; a national network of 57 Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) sites responsible for each US state, territory, and the District of Columbia; one Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC) located in York, PA; 18 End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) networks; and the QualityNet Development and Project Management Contractors support locations. <br />Each of these organizations maintain a staff of highly qualified, multidisciplinary experts in medicine, quality improvement, health information management, health informatics, Information Technology (IT) systems security, statistical analysis, computer programming and operations, communications, public relations, and clerical support. Their mission is to ensure the quality, effectiveness, efficiency, security, and economy of health care services provided to Medicare and Medicaid Beneficiaries.</p>
<p>CMS organizational business processes that are supported by QualityNet include:<br />&bull; The capability for collection and management of clinical, survey, and project data from Medicare and Medicaid providers;<br />&bull; The management and analysis of that clinical, survey, and project data by the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO);<br />&bull; The collection of data by ESRD Network Organizations to administer the national Medicare ESRD Program; and<br />&bull; The management and provision of Medicare and Medicaid information to providers that include but are not limited to hospitals, physician or family practice clinics, dialysis clinics, Skilled Nursing Facilities, Home Health Agencies, Nursing Homes, and various specialized clinics.<br />The HealthCare Quality Information System (HCQIS) is a major application environment that uses application groups, shared servers, and WAN to monitor and improve utilization and quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid Beneficiaries. HCQIS is composed of 5 application groups:<br />&bull; Standard Data Processing System (SDPS) for Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), including the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC);<br />&bull; Value Based Purchasing (VBP) IT Infrastructure for Physician Quality Reporting System ( PQRS) and Hospital Outpatient;<br />&bull; Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWNWeb);<br />&bull; Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) for states and CMS; and<br />&bull; Quality Improvement Initiatives (QII).</p>
<p>The intent is to identify potential sources that are capable of performing the support for the technical infrastructure components of the QualityNet environment. These infrastructure support services are wide-ranging, covering areas such as:<br />&bull; Hosting a data center<br />&bull; Network management<br />&bull; Network management<br />&bull; UNIX and Microsoft servers management<br />&bull; Configuration management<br />&bull; Validation Testing<br />&bull; Stress Testing<br />&bull; Project Management<br />&bull; Security<br />&bull; Help Desk<br />&bull; Production Support<br />&bull; QIO System Administration<br />&bull; ESRD System Administration<br />&bull; File and Print Services<br />&bull; E-mail services<br />&bull; Desktop support<br />&bull; Remote Access</p>
<p>History:<br />The Standard Data Processing System (SDPS), implemented in 1997, supports the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Program and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) community. Prior to SDPS, each QIO was responsible for developing solutions to meet the management and reporting requirements of the Statement of Work (SoW). Besides the obvious inefficiencies of redundant systems and costs, each QIO had different competencies during that period. Since the inception of SDPS, the functions of SDPS have encompassed support, standardization and development of data, software and standards for the QIO community. SDPS continues to rapidly evolve with innovative technology to meet the challenges of supporting and interfacing directly with the QIO community and surrounding healthcare industry.</p>
<p>Under Part B of Title XI of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act), as amended by the Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982 Quality Improvement Organizations (QIO) were created. Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOS) are under contract by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to:<br />&bull; Improve quality of care for Beneficiaries;<br />&bull; Protect the integrity of the Medicare Trust Fund by ensuring that Medicare pays only for services and goods that are reasonable and medically necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting; and<br />&bull; Protect Beneficiaries by expeditiously addressing individual complaints, notices, and appeals, such as Beneficiary complaints; provider-issued notices of non-coverage (Hospital-Issued Notice of Non-Coverage [HINN], Notice of Discharge and Medicare Appeal Rights [NODMAR], and Medicare Advantage appeal); Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) violations; and other related statutory QIO responsibilities.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for the QIO Scope of Work is found in Part B of Title XI of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act), as amended by the Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982. The Act established the Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization Program, now known as the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Program.<br />The statutory mission of the QIO Program, as set forth in Section 1862(g) of the Act, is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, economy, and quality of services delivered to Medicare Beneficiaries.<br />In support of the QIO Program, CMS authorized the design and implementation of a SDPS for the User Community. SDPS is an information system solution that provides a common platform for users to share applications and data to promote efficiency and increase productivity. SDPS is the QIO Information Technology and data support infrastructure.<br />The work under this contract is being performed under 1154c of Title XI of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act), as amended by the Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982 and is aligned with the work and mission under Sections 3001 - 3004 and Section 10322 of Health Care Reform H.R. 3950, TITLE III-IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF HEALTH CARE, Subtitle A-Transforming the Health Care Delivery System, Part I.<br />Health Care Reform H.R. 3950, TITLE III-IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF HEALTH CARE, Subtitle A-Transforming the Health Care Delivery System, Part I - Linking Payment to Quality Outcomes under the Medicare Program requires the Secretary to improve quality and efficiency of Hospital services delivered to Medicare Beneficiaries. <br />The QIO work established and set forth in Part B of Title XI of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act), as amended by the Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982; aligns to the same established mission and mandates in Health Care Reform H.R. 3950, TITLE III-IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF HEALTH CARE, Subtitle A-Transforming the Health Care Delivery System. The SDPS User Community, for purposes of this contract, refers to the QIOs, the State Agencies, CMS Central and Regional Offices, the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC), and other organizations/partners that may be incorporated in support of CMS initiatives. This system services the daily, ongoing support that the SDPS User Community needs to fulfill their contractual requirements in a manner supportive of an ongoing quality improvement Program.<br />The VBP Application group utilizes SDPS applications and warehouses in addition to other VBP specific products. These applications and warehouse support two provisions of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA) Division B, Title 1:</p>
<p>A. Section 101, Physician Payment and Quality Improvement, includes the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS). This law authorizes a financial incentive for eligible professionals to participate in a Voluntary Quality Reporting Program. Eligible professionals, who chose to participate and successfully report on a designated set of quality measures for services paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and provided between July 1 and December 31, 2007 to Medicare Beneficiaries under the Traditional Fee-for-Service Program, may earn a bonus payment of 1.5% of their charges during that period, subject to a cap.</p>
<p>On December 29, 2007, the President signed Public Law 110-173, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA), which authorized the continuation of the Physician Quality Reporting System ( PQRS) for 2008. The 2008 PQRS reporting period is January 1-December 31, 2008. <br />The Extension Act also provides new authorities for enhancing PQRS that CMS will be implementing during 2008. MMSEA requires CMS to establish alternative reporting periods and alternative criteria for satisfactorily reporting groups of measures via claims for 2008. It also requires CMS to establish alternative reporting periods and alternative criteria for satisfactorily reporting measures via registries to enable professionals to earn the 1.5% incentive for participation in PQRS based on data submitted via these mechanisms. <br />B. Section 109, requires the development of measures for the evaluation of the quality of care of services provided by hospitals in outpatient settings. An Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) Reporting Hospital Quality Data for Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) Program modeled after the current Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) RHQDAPU Program will be established.</p>
<p>Section 109, which applies to hospitals as defined under section 1886(d)(1(B) of the Act, also requires that Hospital Outpatient Departments (HOPD) that fail to report data required for the quality measures selected by the Secretary will incur a reduction in their annual OPD fee schedule increase factor by 2.0 percentage points. OPPS payments beginning in CY 2009 will be based on hospital reporting of OPD data beginning in CY 2008. The statutory authority for maintenance of the ESRD System is given under sections 226A, 1875, and 1881 of the Social Security Act. The ESRD Program was established in 1972 pursuant to the provisions of 299I, Public Law 92-602, Section 226A of the Social Security Act - Special Provisions Relating to Coverage under Medicare Program for ESRD.</p>
<p>Section 299I, Public Law 92-603 established the ESRD Networks. One of the ESRD Networks functions is to support the renal registry (1881(c) (2)</p>
<p>The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-509) (Section 1881(d)(7) required that the Secretary establish a national ESRD registry. This registry is called the United States Renal Data System (USRDS). The contract to administer the USRDS is awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The registry is currently run through a contract with the University of Minnesota. This registry utilizes data reported by network organizations, transplant centers, and other sources to support the analysis of alternative treatment modes, the evaluation of allocation of resources, the analysis of morbidity and mortality trends and other quality of care indices, and other studies that assist the Congress in evaluating the ESRD Program.</p>
<p>Public Law 95-292 established the ESRD Program Management and Medical Information System (PMMIS). The PMMIS was created in response to the CMS requirement to provide information on ESRD patients once the above legislation ensured that Medicare would pay for the dialysis treatments and kidney transplants required to sustain a patient's life. The ESRD/PMMIS is a mission critical system to the renal community.</p>
<p>Clinical Performance Measures (CPM) Data Set was developed in response to section 4558(b) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which required the Secretary to develop and implement a method to measure and report the quality of dialysis services under the Medicare Program by the year 2000. CPM contains information, in the form of quality measures, on entitled ESRD Beneficiaries who receive hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis treatments.</p>
<p>Section 153(c) of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 establishes the ESRD Quality Incentive Program (QIP). This program mandates up to 2% payment reduction for providers of services and dialysis facilities if performance scores do not meet or exceed the established performance standards.</p>
<p>Additional background on the ESRD QIP Conceptual Model can be found at: http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-22486.pdf Pg 50009, Section XV.</p>
<p><br />The Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) is CMS's key tracking, analysis, and data repository system for Medicare, Medicaid, and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) provider quality of care. QIES collects and validates data on provider and beneficiary specific outcomes of care and performance across a multitude of delivery sites (including nursing homes, home health agencies, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and swing bed hospitals) for use in improving the quality and cost effectiveness of services provided by the Medicare/Medicaid/CLIA Programs. QIES is considered to be a Medicare Modernization Act (of 1999) (MMA) critical CMS system integral to many key CMS's quality of care activities including: the Survey and Certification Program; the Administrator's quality indicators for Nursing Homes (NH) and Home Health Agencies (HHA); complaints and enforcement monitoring; accreditation processes; consumer information initiatives (such as Nursing Home and Home Health Compare); as well as, data validation and survey process enhancement initiatives. <br />QIES is also crucial to CMS' payment systems for Skilled Nursing Facilities and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities. The System collects and validates patient assessment data directly linked to claims for payment and correlates utilization groupings to actual patient clinical and functional status. <br />QIES directly supports and implements provisions of Ominibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) 1987, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) HIPAA 1996, Balance Budget Act (BBA) 1997, and the MMA, and numerous implementing regulations. QIES also fulfills CMS action items pursuant to Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports and Congressional committee Corrective Action Plans on the Nursing Home enforcement and complaints processes. <br />QIES has been under development since 1998 and is now at a critical System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) juncture in a multi-year effort to convert our most complex providers (CLIA laboratories and hospitals) from the legacy Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting System (OSCAR) to QIES. Adding to the urgency and complexity of current work are implementation of the legislative mandates of Section 723 of the MMA and National Provider Identifier for HIPAA; and two regulations pursuant to BBA97 making significant changes to the Prospective Payment System (PPS) assessment specifications for both Nursing Homes (NHs) and Home Health Associations (HHAs). The continued, uninterrupted conversion of QIES is critical to CMS's payment and quality of care improvement processes, and to implementation and support of statutory mandates and major CMS and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) initiatives.<br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), Office of Clinical Standards and Quality (OCSQ) is committed to ensuring that Medicare Beneficiaries receive quality healthcare. One of the primary goals of the CMS is to ensure that Medicare Beneficiaries receive high quality services in a healthy and safe environment. To accomplish this goal, CMS contracts with Quality Improvement Organizations (QIO) for the purpose of determining that Medicare services are reasonable and medically necessary; for the purposes of promoting the effective, efficient, and economical delivery of health care services to Medicare Beneficiaries; and of promoting the quality of services of the type for which payment may be made under Medicare.<br />The QIO Program is the Federal Government's only major direct Quality Improvement Program and serves as the CMS primary resource in its efforts to improve the quality of care for Medicare Beneficiaries. OCSQ is responsible for oversight, management, and direction of the Medicare Case Review Program administered by QIOs. The purpose of case reviews is to support the mission of the Medicare Beneficiary Protection Program to improve the quality of care for Medicare Beneficiaries and facilitate the provision of the right care for every person every time. OCSQ seeks to ensure that the Beneficiary complaint processes are efficient, functional, secure, and well documented in the provision of high-quality service in support of Beneficiaries and providers. In an effort to more efficiently monitor and manage QIO activities, while establishing consistency and simplifying the processes, OCSQ seeks to create a National Standardized System to capture, track, manage and analyze the activities associated with the Beneficiary complaint process. The System envisioned will: utilize technologies that meet current CMS standards; implement higher levels of security protections; and drastically improve business functionality. <br />On January 16, 2009, HHS published a final rule adopting ICD-10-CM (and ICD-10-PCS) to replace ICD-9-CM in HIPAA transactions, effective implementation date of October 1, 2014. HCQIS is a downstream user of ICD-10 code set and will undergo major design and development efforts to meet the mandated implementation date. The Contractor shall provide full range of infrastructure support for ICD-10-CM standards implementation in HCQIS. <br />Additional information on ICD-10 adoption can be found at:<br />http://www.cms.gov/ICD10/<br />Purpose and Objectives: <br />OCSQ Data Center Hosting &amp; Operations will include the following scope of services:<br />A.

<DESC>NASA LaRC is hereby soliciting information from potential sources on theircapability to fabricate, inspect, and heat treat large single-piece cylinders.	Inparticular, NASA is interested in capabilities using aluminum alloy 2219.  NASA seeksinformation from entities which have demonstrated fabrication of similar cylinders.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites forthe release of any solicitation or synopsis. NASA is exploring advanced designs, high fidelity analysis methods, near-net shapemanufacturing technology, and advanced materials that will enable improved performance,safety, and reliability along with reductions in fabrication cost and weight of cryogenictanks.	Current cryogenic tank barrels are of multi-piece construction, manufactured fromthick plate material that is heavily machined to create integral stiffeners, formed tocurvature, and then welded to assemble tank barrels.  This manufacturing method createsover 30,000 linear inches of welds in a typical Space Shuttle External Tank, known sitesof reduced material properties and risk of defects.  Consequently, current cryogenictanks are overdesigned to ensure that adequate safety margins exist. Eliminating weldswill improve performance, increase safety and reliability, and also reduce structuralweight by eliminating weld lands. In addition, NASAs Shell Buckling Knockdown Factor Project (SBKF) has demonstrated thatimplementation of improved (i.e., less conservative, more robust) shell buckling designfactors (a.k.a. knockdown factors) during launch vehicle design can enable significantweight savings in these vehicles. Design trade studies have predicted that additionalperformance improvements and reductions in weight can be realized by eliminating weldsand associated weld lands. NASA has been developing near-net shape (NNS) manufacturing methods to producesingle-piece cryogenic tank components that eliminate welds, improve material usageefficiency, and reduce manufacturing costs.  During the Constellation program, NNSmanufacturing methods were successfully deployed for fabrication of single-piececryogenic tank spin formed domes and roll forged y-ring adapters. Some commercial launchproviders have baselined roll forged barrels and spin formed components as elements increw capsule designs.  NASA seeks to apply similar technology to tank barrels in order toreplace the current multi-piece construction, realize the benefits of eliminating welds,and explore the increased design space afforded by single-piece manufacturing. NASA seeks to fabricate a sub-scale single-piece cryogenic tank barrel and performtesting to quantify the performance improvements and weight saving associated witheliminating longitudinal welds.  Prior testing of an 8 ft.-diameter integrally machinedstiffened cylinder in the SBKF program provides a baseline geometry and measure oftypical structural performance of a built up welded structure.	A tank barrel of similarsize, but without welds, can be fabricated from a single-piece seamless cylinder. Thegeometry of the planned test barrel is shown in Figures 1-3, with the current plan forthe government to do the machining.NASA seeks to procure two (2) single-piece seamless cylinders from which integrallystiffened test barrels will be fabricated.  Material for fabricating the cylinders willbe purchased by the vendor performing the fabrication and will NOT be supplied by theGovernment.  The preliminary specifications are set forth below.   Please advise if therequirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercialitem is defined in FAR 2.101.	We request your comments on the requirements andstandards set forth below.  The seamless cylinders shall be fabricated from aluminum alloy 2219 and shall conform tothe chemical composition limits shown in AMS 4144F, determined in accordance with AMS2355. The cylinders shall have approximate dimensions of 96.5 in. outer diameter (OD), 94in. inner diameter (ID), and 90 in. length. The final dimensions prior to fabricationwill be negotiated with and approved by NASA LaRC. The cylinders shall be solution heat treated, mechanically stress-relieved, andprecipitation heat treated to the -T851 condition.  Heat treatments shall be performed inaccordance with AMS 2772F.  Results from mechanical property qualification testing, perAMS 4144F, and chemical composition certificates will be provided to the government withthe completed cylinders.  The cylinders are to be inspected by ultrasonic methods andshall meet or exceed ASTM B594, Class B specification.NASA expects delivery of a final report with the fabricated cylinders that includes acomplete description of the fabrication methods, photographic documentation of thefabrication steps, certification of material composition, mechanical property testresults, quantitative NDE, and dimensional measurements.Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet theabove requirement should submit a capability statement and the following information:1) Proposed fabrication plan  Describe the method that will be used to fabricate thecylinders, including forming operations, and thermo-mechanical steps to accomplish heattreatment to a -T851 condition, per AMS 2772F.	How will you meet the requirements forheat treatment per AMS 2772F?  Do you have in-house heat treating facilities or will anexternal vendor be used?  Define the dimensional tolerances on ID and OD, cylindricity,parallelism, and waviness along the length of the cylinder that can be met for a cylinderof the approximate dimensions provided in the description. These tolerances are necessaryto demonstrate to the government the extent to which cross-sectional profiles will becircular, in parallel with each other, and perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder.  2) Inspection  Describe an NDE inspection plan to ensure that manufactured cylinders arefree of forming defects.  Identify the inspection method to be used and at which stepsduring the fabrication process where inspection will occur.  Describe any preparatorymachining and/or cleaning necessary to facilitate inspection. Can you meet therequirements of ASTM B594 practices?3) Validation testing  Describe in-house test capabilities and/or partners that will beused to perform validation testing per AMS 4144F.  How will you meet the testingrequirements in AMS 4144F?4) Machining capability  While it is the intent for the government to machine the testbarrels from the single-piece cylinders, include a description of in-house machiningcapability or where final machining of the test barrel could be pursued.5) Final report  Can you provide the information cited in the description for inclusionin a final report?6) Fabrication history of similar cylinders  Please identify any cylinders that you haveproduced without welds, fabricated from 2219, and heat treated to T8 temper. Describecurrent and past production examples of similar cylinders, including the materials andprocesses used to produce them.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is developing an acquisition strategy for an OPNAVINST 3710.7 series requirement for providing aircrew High-G academic and centrifuge device training for the period of October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013 for approximately 600 aircrew members per fiscal year, with the option of continuing centrifuge training until September 30, 2017.  This training is intended to fill a Navy capability gap due to the possible end of operational service-life of the Navyâ€™s existing centrifuge located at NAS Lemoore, CA.  High-G academic and centrifuge training is directed for all aircrew assigned to fly in High-G aircraft and is a vital element of Navy safety and operational effectiveness in flight.

The Navy is interested in service solutions that will allow for aircrew centrifuge training.
  Of the available strategies, NAVAIR is considering the viability of the following socio-economic approaches: Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) set-aside, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside, Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Section 8(a) suitability, and Total Small Business set-aside.  The Contracting Officer must establish a reasonable expectation that offers would be obtained from two or more HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, or Small Business entities that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery.  You are advised that the Government is seeking to define the applicability of the requirement with regard to the available socio-economic programs.
  From the responses to this market research, the Government will evaluate the viable options and select the final acquisition strategy.  Therefore, your response to this research is instrumental in supporting your companyâ€™s business interests.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to determine that any of the above strategies would be viable, the requirement may be competed on an unrestricted basis.  Therefore, information from both large and small businesses is requested.  It is anticipated that any resulting contract would be accomplished under the provisions of a firm fixed price (FFP) contract.  The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 611512 with a size standard of $25.5M per year.  

ACQUISITION DECRIPTION:

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS.  A SUBSEQUENT SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT MAY FOLLOW.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO ANY FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENT.

VA, on behalf of the iEHR, is seeking qualified service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) and veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs) in anticipation of a future requirement.  VA is requesting all interested SDVOSBs and VOSBs to submit a written response to this Sources Sought notice.  This Sources Sought notice is issued for the sole purpose of conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. 

1.  OVERVIEW
Currently, when VA or Department of Defense (DoD) health care providers need to view patient information from the other Departments' beneficiary population, they must log into their agency specific system while referring to local remote data views that pull in data from the opposing system.  For example, when a Service Member (SM) is treated at a DoD Military Treatment Center, his/her information is entered into the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) via the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) and the data remains within AHLTA.  Similarly, if the same SM is later treated at a VA Medical Center, his/her information is entered into Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) through the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and the data from the encounter remains within the patients' EHR in CPRS.  In order to view the complete set of both records, a provider would be required to have access to both VistA/CPRS and CHCS/AHLTA to gain a perspective of the SM/Veteran's entire medical history.
  
In Spring 2011, the DoD and VA Health Executive Council signed an agreement to utilize the JANUS-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) prototype at Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC).  JANUS 4.0 is a copy written (attached) combined web-services engine and GUI developed jointly by VA and DoD Subject Matter Experts through various face-to-face requirements gathering and design sessions held in early 2011.  JANUS was first deployed and tested by both VA and DoD clinical staff at the TAMC.  Today, JANUS delivers CHCS and VistA data in a single user-customizable screen.  JANUS's web-based architecture is scalable, which allows it to grow with new data types or software packages and accommodate new features.

It is requested that any interested and qualified SDVOSB or VOSB submit the information required below via email to the point of contact listed at this bottom of this announcement.

2.  ANTICIPATED SCOPE OF WORK
The Contractor shall provide the necessary information technology services to complete modifications, enhancements, and change management support as contracted for the Presentation Layer.  The joint GUI and web-services engine implemented to the Presentation Layer will include:

    (a)  INTERFACE iEHR PRESENTATION LAYER TO A CONTEXT MANAGEMENT (CM) SYSTEM:  The Contractor will require experience with existing bridges at the James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (JALFHCC) as well as Single Sign-On (SSO) and CM capabilities in JANUS 4.0. The bridge modifications shall include enhanced logoff logic, customization, and modification of the access code field in the credential learning screens, a complete quality assurance cycle and documentation describing the new bridge configuration and operation. The Contractor may need to assist as needed in development of bridge software with Government developers or other Contractor developers.

    (b)  PROOF OF CONCEPT iEHR PRESENTATION LAYER PORTAL PILOT: The Contractor will require experience with the existing iEHR Portal work and JANUS widgets.  In conjunction with the iEHR Portal team, the Contractor shall evaluate an open-source portal using an open Service Oriented Architecture framework and leverage the existing iEHR Portal work to break out three (3) widgets from JANUS (e.g. demographics, labs, and prescriptions).  The Contractor shall portalize existing widgets as they appear in JANUS. 

The Contractor shall take another application that is wrapped in the portlet and analyze the interaction with the widgets when placed into the iEHR-identified portal.  The objective is to get content in the portal container to get maximum user subscription to that content.
 
    (c)  CAPABILITY TO PULL SERVICE MEMBER AND VETERAN DATA FROM DoD CLINICAL DATA REPOSITORY: The Contractor shall develop and document requirements and coordinate with DoD personnel to ensure that JANUS 4.0 will pull and display service member and veteran data from the DoD enterprise level rather than a local host for each DoD location.

    (d)  PROVIDE A NEW WRITE-BACK FUNCTIONALITY FOR ALLERGIES FOR CLINICAL USERS: The Contractor shall provide new write-back functionality to:
    - Provide an assessment of existing legacy write-back interfaces and provide a recommendation to help inform legacy adaptors needed for the iEHR enterprise solution.
    - Capture authorized DoD user direct entry Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) to Veteran/SM Allergy data that updates the matched VA Veteran record.
    - Capture authorized VA user direct entry (CRUD) to Veteran /SM Allergy data that updates the matched DoD SM record.
    - Capture audit history of all DoD user direct entry (CRUD) to Veteran/SM Allergy data that updates the matched VA Veteran record.
    - Capture audit history of all VA user direct entry (CRUD) to Veteran/SM Allergy data that updates the matched DoD SM record.

    (e)  IMPLEMENT ENHANCED INTEGRATED GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE IN USE AT JALFHCC TO TRIPLER ARMY MEDICAL FACILITY/VA HONOLULU: The Contractor will require experience with JANUS 4.0 and the existing iEHR at the Tripler Army Medical Facility/VA in Honolulu to install and implement the enhanced JANUS 4.0 at that location.  Tasks will include SSO/CM bridge modifications and the ability to pull SM and veteran data from the DoD Clinical Data Repository.

    (f)  IMPLEMENT THE ABILITY TO VIEW EXISTING PREVENTIVE HEALTH DATA: The Contractor will require capability and experience with developing widgets in JANUS 4.0 to compile and display existing Preventive Health data elements that are available in CPRS and AHLTA.

3.  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
Interested parties should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement not to exceed ten (10) pages (including any attachments) that clearly details the firm's ability to perform the aspects of the requirement described above.  Specifically, the Government requests that capability statements demonstrate the ability to perform based on relevant examples of similar performance or involvement with similar contracts or projects.

This requirement will include all management, material, supplies, supervision, personnel, labor, facilities, transportation, general and specialized equipment, maintenance, repair, and minor construction.  <br><br>This is a Sole Source Synopsis published for informational purposes only. The Army will award a sole source bridge contract with a base period of twelve months.  A twelve month bridge contract is needed to allow the Government sufficient time to award a follow-on Installation Maintenance Contract (IMC) contract and to allow for a necessary 60-day phase in period. <br><br><br>Proposed contractor information:<br><br>Contractor: TM Stuttgart GMBH<br>Kurmarker Strasse 86<br>70569 Stuttgart<br>Proposed Contract number: W564KV-12-D-0008<br>Points of Contact: Sue Myers & Sean de Haas <br>Email: sue.e.myers.civ@mail.mil & sean.e.dehaas.civ@mail.mil<br>Place of Performance: United States Army Garrison (USAG) Stuttgart, Germany<br>Postal Code: 70569<br>Country: Germany<br><br> The current BMC contract, DAJA02-02-D-0001, expires on 31 May 2011. The Army is currently preparing for the follow-on IMC contract. The follow-on IMC solicitation, W564KV-12-R-0017, will be competed under full and open competition.

The follow-on contract will include a 60-day phase in period and full performance will begin 1 June 2013. The bridge contract is being awarded to prevent a lapse in service from 1 June 2012 until performance of the follow-on contract begins on 1 June 2013. The bridge will be awarded sole source because the size and complexity of the requirement necessitate a 60-day phase in period for the mobilization of equipment and materials, personnel assets, as well as the completion of background checks and other administrative procedures required for installation access purposes. The incumbent contractor, TM Stuttgart, is the only source capable of beginning performance immediately to meet the Government's needs without a significant and unallowable break in service. <br><br>The bridge contract will be awarded on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, responsible sources who submit a capability statement or proposal within fifteen days after the publication date of this synopsis will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Thorlabs of Newton, NJ for numerous mechanical optical components to be used by the Sensor Science Division (SSD) of the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.
<p>The Sensor Science Division (SSD) of the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) has a requirement for Optical Components, including optical fiber lenses; iris diaphragms; adapter plates, etc.</p>
<p>The mission of PML is to develop and disseminate the national standards of length, mass, force and shock, acceleration, time and frequency, electricity, temperature, humidity, pressure and vacuum, liquid and gas flow, and electromagnetic, optical, microwave, acoustic, ultrasonic, and ionizing radiation. Its activities range from fundamental measurement research through provision of measurement services, standards, and data.<br />The mission of the SSD within PML is to develop and provide national measurement standards and services to advance physical science and technology in optical radiation, temperature, pressure, vacuum, flow, and related physical phenomena</p>
<p>The Remote Sensing Laboratory of SSD requires specific optical components and other equipment components from Thorlabs, Inc. of Newton, NJ. The components are required to complete an integration of two custom NIST developed existing optical sensors, located in the NIST laboratory, into an operational, optical fiber coupled, field instrument for experiments in oceanic waters to study in-water instrument self-shading.</p>
<p>Each individual component must be 100 percent compatible and be capable of interfacing with the existing custom NIST developed optical sensors.</p>
<p>The proprietary design of Thorlabs components are the sole components capable of interfacing the existing sensors. The use of other manufacturer components would require the laboratory to completely re-design the sensors, costing the Government an extensive amount of money and time and hindering the mission of the SSD.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 334516, with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by May 18, 2012 will be considered by the Government.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)

Date:  	5/1/2012							PR Number: R1576121001

1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):Replace existing Submersible Wastewater Yeoman Pump Series 9100, Model 4073 E-L in the Canyon Main Lift Station and purchasing a spare at a cost of $9,440.  The existing pump has failed and the Canyon Main Lift Station is running on one pump with no backup pump available.  With spring coming and the park opening soon the usage to this system will increase. We need a pump as soon as possible.	
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale  (Check one and explain below):
__X__		Only one responsible source. ______	Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. 
Explain:   This is the only company that can get this pump for us (see attached email).  We are using the existing control panel and sliding bracket system, so it has to be the exact same pump.  To change this pump the lift station would have to be re-designed at considerable cost to the government.  There is also a time issue, we need the pump as soon as possible, if the one remaining pump goes down, raw sewage will be spilling into the Yellowstone River.  																											 3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:
Market Research has shown that this is the only company that we can get the pump from.																4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
a.	Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<a href="mailto:maureen.hoesly@navy.mil">maureen.hoesly@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Atlantic intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to Raftelis Financial Consultants, Inc., 1031 S. Caldwell Street, Suite 101, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28203-5109.  

The award will be made under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source exists and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. FAR Part 13 procedures will be followed.

Raftelis Financial Consultants (RFC) will be responsible for the following tasks related to redetermination of costs associated with ownership and operation of the utility systems at MCAS Beaufort, NAVHOSP Beaufort, and MCRD Parris Island:
â€¢	Information Review
â€¢	On-Site Meeting with Installation and NAVFAC
â€¢	Review of Price Redetermination Proposal
â€¢	Preparation of Pricing Analysis Tool
â€¢	Testing of Pricing Assumptions
â€¢	Assistance of Negotiation Position Development
The period of performance will be for six months.
 The rationale that only one responsible source RFC exists is based on: RFC has specialized expertise in the area of utilities privatization regarding contract development and related economic models and analysis methods.  RFC owns the proprietary model used to analyze the economics of Navy utility privatization projects. This model was used in evaluating firms for the original Beaufort/Parris Island award and should be consistently applied in order to accurately analyze the price redetermination. Any other contracted source will have to independently gather the data and perform initial analyses already performed by RFC. This is because the other contracted source could not rely on RFC's past analysis and recommendations without an independent data collection and review.
 In addition, the Government will have to facilitate any new contractor's data collection and then review and comment on the new contractor's analysis to ensure its quality, causing increased costs and time delays. 

The North American Industrial Code System (NAICS) code is 541618 with a size standard of $14 million in average annual receipts. Interested parties must submit their capability statements in writing within 15 days of the date this notice is posted. Written responses can be emailed to maureen.hoesly@navy.mil. Telephone calls will not be accepted. Any responses received after the 15 day submission period will not be considered. Responses will be used solely to determine whether a competitive solicitation should be issued and will not be the basis for an award.
 A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is at the sole discretion of the Government.

             with pacing and Sp02 package 
              
It is essential to the government's needs that it purchase the Physio-Control, Inc. Lifepak 15 V2 and V20e Difibrilators/Monitors, with ancillary equipment, since the VA Healthcare System has currently standardized the use of this manufacturer's brand  and model defibrillator througout it's hospitals. 

It is also essential to have the LifePak 15 V2, since the master crash carts have the same defibrillators, being they are used in emergency situations, and it is essential for them to have the same standardized features in order to quickly provide safe care.  The PhysioControl LifePak 15 biphasic defibrillator was chosen because it also provides healthcare providers with the opportunity to monitor, pace, and defibrillate heart rhythms, as well as, have continuous end tidal CO2 monitoring (also known as capnography).  

2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Advanced Cardiac Life Support highly recommends capnography monitoring for 2 specific reasons. The first reason is that it allows providers to monitor the effectiveness of chest compressions during CPR. Research demonstrates that increased quality in compressions improves patient survival rates in cardiac arrest situations. The second reason capnography is recommended is that allows verification of proper endotracheal tube placement which is critical in oxygenating patients experiencing cardiac arrest.	

Physio-Control, Inc. is the sole exclusive seller of this equipment, including on the Federal Supply Schedule.

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>

<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527, Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

</a>
<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective January 23, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT:  CURRENT SCHEDULE 084 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.


SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:  Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website.  The ORCA website can be accessed http://www.bpn.orga.gov.  

Please note that any offer submitted after February 22, 2012 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated January 23, 2012 (Refresh #18) and must be submitted through the eOffer system.  Offers received after February 22, 2012 that are submitted on prior versions will not be accepted.  

Effective December 10, 2010, firearm lubricants added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Number  (SIN) 426-4G, Firearms Storage, Securing and Cleaning Equipment; Unloading Stations; Bullet Recovery Systems and Gun Racks must meet the Bio-preferred standard.  Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/]) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for green products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies.  In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated that one SIN on Schedule 84 will require green certification.  For SIN 426-4G (Attachment 5), firearm lubricants must be certified as Biopreferred by obtaining certification from the U. S. Department of Agriculture at www.biopreferred.gov.  The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the USDA website.   If not listed, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to ask for copies of the certification.

This refresh includes the addition of five (5) new SINs for Ancillary Supplies and/or Services: 260-1000, 465-1000, 633-1000, 246-1000, and 426-1000. These SINs may only be offered in conjunction with the offer of a corresponding product SIN. 

Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 246-50; services previously covered under SIN 246-50 are now covered under new SIN 246-1000.

Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 260-98; services previously covered under SIN 260-98 are now covered under new SIN 260-1000.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for commercial products and services. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-57.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519 including Exception 2 for value added resellers. The small business size standard is 150 employees. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>This is a brand name only requirement. Quoters must provide the brand name software identified within the line items.</p>
<p>This is a brand name only requirement for Oracle software and support. This project supports Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) biometrics research and development objectives in automated fingerprint-matching system testing, and standards through an on-going FBI/National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) collaboration.</p>
<p>NIST has been in collaboration with the FBI since 1968 in conducting research on automated fingerprint-matching systems. Since 2008, with the help and support from the FBI, the current legacy fingerprint-matching test environment at NIST is in a transitional phase to update NIST's current supercomputer based architecture to the new blade-based Next Generation Identification (NGI) system currently in operation at the FBI. The blade-based NGI system architecture utilizes a fingerprint-matching system designed specifically for the FBI's current operational system. The FBI requires that NIST install the NGI system architecture, on FBI supplied hardware so that NIST will remain in sync with the FBI's operational system.</p>
<p>Transition and updating of the NIST fingerprint-matching system to duplicate the fingerprint-matching subsystem of the FBI's new NGI system is critical for NIST to remain in sync with the operational behavior of the FBI system, to ensure repeatability of NIST's testing framework, and maintain the collaboration.</p>
<p>The database management system software by Oracle is the database management system used in the FBI system and the subsystem NIST must duplicate. The Oracle database management system is the only system that is identical to the FBI's subsystem and will ensure performance replication of the FBI's finger print matching subsystem.</p>
<p>NIST requires the Oracle brand database management system software lobe installed on the FBI supplied hardware already in NIST's possession and intended for this purpose.</p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NRMJ1000-12-02335DT.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-58.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 334519. The small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial items:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 - Three (3) Condensation Particle Counters (CPC) instruments for Aerosol monitoring and research</p>
<p>CLIN 0002- Option to purchase two (2) additional CPC instruments based on available funding</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>Background: The Aerosol group in the Global Monitoring Division has a requirement for three (3) CPC instruments with an option for two (2) more to deploy to remote field sites in support of aerosol monitoring research.</p>
<p>The basic ESRL/GMD aerosol system consists of a nephelometer (measures aerosol light scattering), a particle soot absorption photometer (PSAP, measures light absorption) and a condensation particle counter (CPC, measures particle number concentration). Expanded aerosol systems may include hygroscopic growth instrumentation, size distribution measurements, chemical sampling, and cloud condensation nuclei concentrations. The individual components for the basic and expanded systems are described below, along with links to descriptions and pictures of each instrument.</p>
<p>In situ measurements of a variety of aerosol optical properties are being made at ESRL/GMD stations. The measurement suite enables calculation of direct aerosol climate forcing. The measured values relevant for climate forcing calculations are: light absorption, total scattering and backscattering. These measurements are used to derive parameters required in the forcing calculation: <br />&bull; optical depth which is a function of the amount of absorbing and scattering aerosol present; <br />&bull; single scattering albedo which is the ratio of total scattering to extinction (extinction = absorption + scattering);<br />&bull; upscatter fraction which is derived from the ratio of backscatter to total scattering.<br />Other parameters measured include: <br />&bull; &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m exponent which gives the wavelength dependence of scattering and is an indication of the particle size distribution;<br />&bull; humidity dependence of light scattering, f(RH), which provides an indication of the hygroscopic nature of the particles and is strongly related to particle chemical composition;<br />&bull; chemical composition of the particles, which provides information on possible sources of the aerosol and its behavior in the atmosphere;<br />&bull; cloud condensation nucleus concentration and total particle number concentration, which allow determination of the cloud-nucleating properties of the aerosol.<br />The intended application is minimally-attended, long-term measurements of particle number concentration at ground stations, either as a stand-alone measurement or as the detector in a scanning particle mobility spectrometer.<br />(1) Operating mode: The instrument shall provide a continuous measurement of the particle number concentration. It shall be designed to operate reliably in a field laboratory, with routine cleaning, servicing, and flow calibration able to be done in the field.<br />(2) Detection limit (particle size): The instrument shall have a counting efficiency of at least 50% for 10 nm diameter particles, and at least 85% for 20 nm diameter particles. <br />(3) Detection limit (particle number concentration): Single-particle counting is required. False background counts, when the instrument is sampling filtered air, shall be less than 1 particle per 100 seconds. Coincidence errors shall be less than 10% for a particle concentration of 10,000 cm-3.<br />(4) Working fluid: Butyl alcohol. The CPC shall have a liquid level sensor that initiates automatic filling from an external bottle, when needed. The automatic filling system shall have sufficient capacity to allow at least one week of unattended operation.</p>
<p>(5) Response time: Sensors, measuring chamber and air pathways shall be designed to ensure a system response time of less than 1 sec. The response time is defined as the time for the signal to change by 63% (1-e-1) of the total change in response to a step change in particle number concentration, e.g., when a filter is switched into the incoming air stream.<br />(6) Outputs: Digital serial (RS-232C or USB) output shall be provided, and complete documentation of the serial interface shall be provided. The serial output shall include instrument status, operating temperatures, flow rate, and particle number concentration, transmitted at a minimum rate of 1 data report per second.</p>
<p>(7) Instrument setup and control: Shall be accomplished through the serial port, and optionally from the front panel of the instrument.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><strong>Background</strong></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;DISA's internal IT Enterprise provides the full complement of IT services for approximately 4,200 DISA employees at the DISA Headquarters Building (1.1 million square feet of total office space) located at Fort George G. Meade, MD (hereto referred to as FGGM), as well as an additional 4,000 DISA employees accessing the enterprise via Local Area Networks (LAN's) located at 39 continental US (CONUS) and overseas (OCONUS) Department of Defense (DoD) locations. A major portion of DISA's IT Enterprise service work is performed at the DISA Headquarters facility. Additionally, a significant amount of the work is performed by support teams traveling to the Agency's CONUS and OCONUS DoD locations. The DISA's IT Enterprise also provides the full complement of IT services to non-DISA organizations (i.e., Industry Partner facilities in the NCR, and other DoD components). A major portion of DISA's IT Enterprise service work is performed at the DISA Headquarters. However, a significant amount of the work is performed by support teams traveling to the agency's CONUS and OCONUS DoD locations. <br /></span><br />The operation of DISA's IT Enterprise is managed by Government personnel with contractors performing many of the operational functions, such as Tier I Helpdesk and Network Monitoring and Reporting functions. Areas of operational responsibility for the DISA IT Enterprise are clearly delineated as either contractor or Government functions. As a result, there are numerous touch points between the contractor and Government personnel executing their DISA IT Enterprise responsibilities.</p>
<p>DISA's global IT Enterprise network is comprised of the data, voice, and video infrastructure that supports the mission requirements of the DISA Director, its Strategic Business Units and subordinate Directorates. The Enterprise employs over 550 physical and virtual servers on three classification levels, and uses approximately 9 principle tool suites to monitor its world-wide status. The DISA IT Enterprise provides network access to mission-oriented databases and applications maintained on non-DISA networks. In total, the Enterprise supports over 8,200 DISA users worldwide. Most of the IT services provided by the DISA IT Enterprise are operated by the Agency's CIO and currently based out of Fort Meade, Maryland. However, some of the IT services (i.e., email) are in the process of transitioning to the Agency's Enterprise Services Directorate (ESD).</p>
<p>DISA is anticipating numerous IT infrastructure consolidation initiatives across the DoD and anticipates other DoD organizations acquiring IT services from the DESS contract Additionally, DISA is anticipating that many of DISA's CONUS and OCONUS locations will begin acquiring IT support services from the DESS contract in order to align with many of the Agency's Campaign Plan initiatives.</p>

<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.<br />C3CEN requires a datalogger and replacement datalogger units that are needed to properly test engineered systems for the field. This equipment will be utilized to bring the Coast Guard back to a mission ready status. The USCG intends to sole source its requirement due to the specific nature of the dataloggers.</p>
<p>(3) A description of the supplies or services. <br />A Purchase Request will be issued for the purchase of: three (3) each, Aanderaa Datalogger, 17 sensor Channels + reference, includes LCD display and 1.5m; MPN: 04001003660 with data and programming cable; PN: 3204<br />Total estimated value: $ 13,500.00</p>

<p>(5) Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of authority cited.<br />This is a single source of supply. The Aanderaa datalogger is a piece of equipment proprietary to the PAWSS system, which is proprietary to the Lockheed Martin VTS system. The reason for purchasing the Aanderaa datalogger is to replace the one that was previously installed on C3CEN's PAWSS baseline.

<p>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources a practicable.<br />A Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be posted on FEDBIZOPS with the statement that any interested persons/parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes.</p>

Aanderaa Data Instruments is the OEM.<br /><br />(9) Any other facts supporting the use of full and open competition.<br />Until the USCG installs a PAWSS system not proprietary to Lockheed Martin VTS system purchasing the Aanderaa Datalogger is cost effective to the Government. This item is currently installed throughout the USCG and will be purchased to backfill Stock Supplies. The Aanderaa Datalogger is proprietary equipment.</p>
<p>(10) List of sources that expressed an interest in this acquisition.<br />No other interest has been expressed at this time.</p>
<p>(11) Actions the agency may take to remove barriers to the competition before any subsequent acquisition for services required. <br />None at this time.</p>

<p><br />COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Submit to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, MRS Product Line, Elizabeth City, NC, ATTN; Denise Coley, (252) 335-6562, denise.m.coley@uscg.mil. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131)<br />U S COAST GUARD<br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS<br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hot line telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>(xiii) See additional document(s) for uploaded documents to support order requirements: <br />(xiv) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS): N/A</p>
<p>(xv) QUOTES ARE DUE BY 4:30 PM EST Thursday May 10th, 2012; Deadline for questions will be Wednesday May 9th, 2012 @ 1:30 PM EST. Please email your quotes and questions to Iris.M.Johnson@uscg.mil.</p>

Economic Price Adjustment -- Semi standard Supplies (Jan 1997)
(a) The Contractor warrants that the supplies identified as line items __________ [offeror insert Schedule line item number] in the Schedule are, except for modifications required by the contract specifications, supplies for which it has an established price. The term? established price? means a price that
(1) is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public, and
(2) is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor.
The Contractor further warrants that, as of the date of this contract, any difference between the unit prices stated in the contract for these line items and the Contractor? established prices for like quantities of the nearest commercial equivalents are due to compliance with contract specifications and with any contract requirements for preservation, packaging, and packing beyond standard commercial practice.
(b) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable established price. Each corresponding contract unit price (exclusive of any part of the unit price that reflects modifications resulting from compliance with specifications or with requirements for preservation, packaging, and packing beyond standard commercial practice) shall be decreased by the same percentage that the established price is decreased. The decrease shall apply to those items delivered on and after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor? established price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly.

Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day every day. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.

"Searched" labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to JBLM-North must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5" in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a "searched" label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.<BR><BR>(b)  If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.     Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (JBLM-North), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective January 23, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 084 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NOTICE: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website. The ORCA website can be accessed http://www.bpn.orga.gov. Please note that any offer submitted after February 22, 2012 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated January 23, 2012 (Refresh #18) and must be submitted through the eOffer system. Offers received after February 22, 2012 that are submitted on prior versions will not be accepted. Effective December 10, 2010, firearm lubricants added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Number (SIN) 426-4G, Firearms Storage, Securing and Cleaning Equipment; Unloading Stations; Bullet Recovery Systems and Gun Racks must meet the Bio-preferred standard. Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/]) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for green products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies. In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated that one SIN on Schedule 84 will require green certification. For SIN 426-4G (Attachment 5), firearm lubricants must be certified as Biopreferred by obtaining certification from the U. S. Department of Agriculture at www.biopreferred.gov. The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the USDA website. If not listed, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to ask for copies of the certification. This refresh includes the addition of five (5) new SINs for Ancillary Supplies and/or Services: 260-1000, 465-1000, 633-1000, 246-1000, and 426-1000. These SINs may only be offered in conjunction with the offer of a corresponding product SIN. Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 246-50; services previously covered under SIN 246-50 are now covered under new SIN 246-1000. Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 260-98; services previously covered under SIN 260-98 are now covered under new SIN 260-1000. Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files.

<DESC><strong>Update on Equivalent Standards<br /></strong><br />As discussed during the draft RFP (DRFP) walk-through on 20 Mar 12 and the FBO Posting on 10 Apr 12, the USAF requested inputs from industry regarding the standards currently listed within the system specifications for both the Aircraft (SS) and the Training System (TSS). The USAF has adjusted the acquisition approach slightly in regards to this issue. The offeror will still be required to accept these documents as contained in the final RFP without any changes. However, a Section H SCR (clause)&nbsp;has been added to the RFP. This will allow the contractor after award to submit alternate equivalent standards to those listed in the SS and TSS up until System Requirements Review. The contractor is responsible to provide the standard and the rationale for the proposed equivalent standard. If USAF concurs, then the SS/TSS will be updated. If the USAF does not concur, then it will be the contractor's responsibility to meet the standards as listed in the SS and TSS at no cost to the USAF or impact to the schedule of the contract.

<DESC><br />Pre-Solicitation Notice for Solicitation 2012-N-14299
<p><br />Project Title: "MAI Project to Evaluate Hierarchical Online and Text Messages for Black and Latino MSM"</p>
<p><br />1. Introduction. This is a Pre-solicitation Notice for a Full and Open Competition under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541720 "Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities", with a small business size standard of $<strong>19 Million</strong>. When released the solicitation number will be 2012-N-14277. The solicitation Request for Proposal (RFP) will be made available on the Internet at http://www.fbo.gov on or about May 15, 2012. Request for Proposals will not be provided to interested parties in hard copy form. Telephone requests will not be honored. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for the release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.</p>
<p>2. Overview: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP), Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP), Prevention Research Branch (PRB), is contemplating a single award two year for this project.</p>
<p>3. Purpose: The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical messages regarding multiple prevention options (via online and text messaging) in potentially reducing HIV transmission risk, and to determine the relative effectiveness of hierarchical messages compared to a single "condom only" message. Tailored messages will be tested for black and Latino MSM who are HIV-positive, high-risk HIV-negative (i.e., unprotected anal sex with a non-primary partner in the past 6 months), and low-risk HIV-negative (i.e., other MSM besides high-risk). A secondary goal is to determine whether specific hierarchical messages and "condom only" message effectiveness - and any differential main effects between message types (hierarchical vs. condom only) -- are moderated by race/ethnicity (i.e., black, Latino) and other demographic variables (e.g., geographical location, age group) for each of the three HIV-status groups.</p>
<p>4. Objectives: The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical messages regarding multiple prevention options in potentially reducing HIV transmission risk, and to determine the relative effectiveness of hierarchical messages compared to a single "condom only" message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />5. Background for the Acquisition. Black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to have very high incidence of HIV infection in the United States - particularly black MSM (Prejean, 2011), and new approaches are needed to effectively reach and reduce HIV risk behavior of minority MSM. For 30 years, condoms have been the only effective physical intervention for reducing HIV infection risk, and thus the single "gold standard" message available to sexually-active MSM for protecting themselves and their partners.</p>
<p>Recently, multiple biomedical intervention options have become available. Results have been presented for partial efficacy of pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PrEP) with anti-retroviral (ARV) medications (Grant 2010), and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is already available in emergency situations. Although there are serious concerns about access to PrEP for many people, recent studies have found that minority (vs. white) MSM were more likely to use (by HIV-negative MSM) and share with sex partners (by HIV-positive MSM) non-prescribed PrEP and PEP several years before known efficacy (Mansergh 2010). Further, minority (vs. white) MSM were more willing to use a less efficacious PrEP product in order to avoid using condoms (Koblin 2011), and more willing to use PrEP even after PrEP efficacy results were known (Sullivan 2011). PrEP and PEP are likely to be prescribed only to HIV-negative MSM at highest risk for HIV transmission (by HIV-positives) and infection (by currently risky HIV-negatives). Even if PrEP access is not an issue, other biomedical interventions may not be too far in the future (e.g., topical ARV gels). Some studies (Marks 2010) have suggested that behavioral "seroadaptative" approaches may be an effective alternative for some - especially HIV-positive MSM. The relatively heightened willingness among some racial/ethnic minority MSM to use alternative products, and perhaps other HIV prevention intervention approaches, needs to be further understood. To help accomplish this, effective hierarchical messages should be developed for multiple prevention options of varying levels of effectiveness.</p>
<p>Little research has been conducted on the effects of focused hierarchical messaging in HIV prevention beyond single messaging of condom use. However, a study of hierarchical (vs. male condom only) messages for young black and Latino women found that women who received the hierarchical message (i.e., use male condoms; if not use female condoms...) were less likely to report that male condoms were effective in reducing HIV infection (Miller 2004). Adding a second option to an existing established option can potentially impact perceptions about and intentions to use various prevention options in the future.</p>
<p>Are there communication approaches to maximize HIV infection risk reduction in a world of multiple effective options? We are now entering an era of multiple prevention options (Shattock 2011) -- including PrEP, PEP, a topical ARV gel, or HIV seroadaptive behaviors (e.g., behavioral decisions based on viral load and anal sex position) -- and we need to prepare for disseminating simple and effective public health messages that clearly present these options. Differential hierarchical message options are likely to apply to HIV-positive, high-risk HIV-negative, and low-risk HIV-negative MSM. Implications of the findings of this study may apply to a variety of public health actions, from fact sheets to social marketing campaigns to federal guidelines, and may inform messaging within behavioral interventions currently implemented in communities of black and Latino MSM, as well as other populations. Lastly, text messaging has demonstrated promise as an intervention approach for high-risk MSM (Reback 2011), but is it differentially effective compared to online messaging of risk information? <br /><br />This proposal is aligned with the following NHAS goal and DHAP Strategic Plan as they relate to black and Latino MSM: Goal 1. Reducing New HIV Infections and related; Step 2. Expand targeted efforts to prevent HIV infection using a combination of effective, evidence-based approaches (2.1. Design and evaluate innovative prevention strategies and combination approaches for preventing HIV in high-risk communities; and 2.4. Expand prevention with HIV-positive individuals.).</p>

<DESC>CLARIFICATON INFORMATION:
<p>While posting Amendment 3 to the OTES RFP on FBO we inadvertently reposted the original RFP instead of the amendment. We posted the correct Amendment 3 under FBO Amendment 4, entitled "OTES TO 0003 Amendment 3 - 14 Oct 11." The PWS attached to RFP Amendment 3 is listed in FBO Amendment 3, entitled TO_02_Det_5_Bomber_Test_Division Amendment 3 - 14 Oct 11. Under FBO Amendment 3, disregard the document entitled "OTES TO 0003 Amendment 3 - 14 Oct 11;" it is a copy of the Original RFP published on 30 Sep 11. There are only 3 amendments to the OTES RFP.</p>

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, Kansas Street, Natick, MA on behalf of the U.S. Army Natick Research, Development and Engineering Command, intends to award a sole source contract with Serco Inc. of 1818 Library ST. STE 1000 Reston, VA 20190-6276 for non-personal commercial services labor to strike twelve (12) large area maintenance shelters that are blocking access from the hangers to the airfield at FT. Campbell which inhibits the base from resuming normal operations. This proposed procurement is for commercial services labor for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency, where delay of award would result in serious injury to the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is IAW FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency. <br><br>The following verbiage is taken directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102 and FAR 6.305(b). <br><br>The proposed acquisition must be accomplished through other than full and open competition because the mission requirements and flight operations, of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) will be adversely impaired if the LAMS are not taken down immediately. BG Magnum has signed a memo requesting immediate support for this instant procurement. The twelve (12) LAMS are blocking access from the hangers to the airfield which inhibits the 160th from resuming normal operations. BG Mangum states "the location of the twelve shelters currently prohibits the 160th SOAR(A) from resuming normal operations." and that "there would be an adverse effect on support available to Special Operations Forces." if these shelters are not removed so normal operations may resume.  <br><br>Contracting Office Address:<br>Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground CCAP-SCN, ATTN: Natick Contracting Division, Building 1, Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760-5011<br><br>Point of Contact(s):<br>Sean Auld, Contract Specialist, Sean.G.Auld.civ@mail.mil, (508) 233-6183.<br>Peter McDonald, Contracting Officer,  Peter.J.McDonald3.civ@mail.mil, (508)-233-6144<br>

<DESC>The Decomp Physical Model (DPM), also known as the Decomp hydrologic field test, is a large field-scale design test that will address scientific, hydrologic, and water management uncertainties specific to the CERP project Decomp. The goal of the design test is to obtain information to reduce uncertainties involved in the planning of later phases of the Decomp Project and CERP overall. The fundamental uncertainties the design test will address are related to the effects associated with canal backfilling, effects associated with levee removal, and the magnitudes and directions of sheetflow necessary to restore and maintain the landscape characteristics of the Everglades. The design test will be extensively monitored and will adhere to operational constraints described in the Draft Operational Guidance in the April 2010 Final Decomp Physical Model Environmental Assessment & Design Test Documentation Report.<br><br>The work for this contract includes installing a new water conveyance structure (Structure 152) on the L-67A levee to convey water from WCA 3A to WCA 3B. S-152 is ten controllable gated 60" diameter culverts with a combined minimum flow of 750 cubic feet per second (cfs). In addition, a 3000 ft gap will be created in the L-67C levee downstream of the S-152 structure. Material from the L-67C gap will be used to construct backfill treatments in the L-67C Canal. 1,000-feet of canal will be backfilled to grade, 1,000-feet will be partially backfilled, and the final 1,000-feet will have no backfill. An additional feature for the contract includes a walkway for the S-152 structure. Contractor shall complete L-67C degrade and backfilling a minimum of 30 calendar days prior to completion of L-67A (S-152). INSTALLATION OF THE STRUCTURE AND BACKFILL PLACEMENT HAS ENVIRONMENTAL SENSITIVITY AS THE WORK IS PREDOMINATELY IN WETLANDS. WORK MAY REQUIRE PLACEMENT OF MATERIALS IN SURFACE WATER. Access to the project site is from US 41 (Tamiami Trail) by S-333 along L-67A and L-67C levees. The period of performance is 180 days from Notice to Proceed.  Work is located in Miami-Dade County, Florida.<br>

0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	
	
	
	
	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
	
	
	
	
	

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
	
	
	
	
	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
This specific VistA Imaging Training course was previously awarded to Hewlett Packard on 7/13/2011 under
 VA PO# 777-C-17243 for a total cost of $34,350.00. HP has not changed the pricing for this 2012 class. Cost averages $2,454.00 per student, and includes the cost of lodging and two meals per day, and local transporation. It is also customized in both training coursework, and hands-on lab work to fit the Production VistA VA Medical Center scenario. It is noted that the lodging rate in the Herndon, VA/DC metro area currently ranges from $108 -$224 per night which equates to $7,560 - $15,680 additional per class (of 14 students). In addition, non-customized VistA courses from other providers average $4,000 per student (per FY 2011 research)	
The training offered by Hewlett Packard is customized and continually updated to address VA-specific requirements, and the pricing is considerably lower than the current non-VA-Specific alternatives.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
No market research was conducted for this specific course buy - market research for previous year's requirement is less than 1 year old and also determined that there are currently no other sources who are offering a VA-specific VistA Imaging Training Class.	
	


(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
VA VistA Imaging configuration and production environment is constantly changing, updating, etc. in the VA Medical Centers and other Federal Health Agencies that utilize this system. The need to train on the most current hardware/software/system configuration for these systems is paramount to ensuring the smooth
Functioning of the systems in the Open VMS cluster environment. At the present time, Hewlett Packard equipment is in operation for these systems throughout the VA. Hewlett Packard has ensured that training
and support services are developed specifically for those VA employees who must configure, operate and maintain the system at their sites. No other vendor has yet to produce a VA-specific program that can address the needs of the VistA Imaging Systems in the Open VMS cluster environment.	
	
	
	
	
	
	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
The Contracting Office may consider publishing a Sources Sought on the GSA FSS, and/or the Federal Business Opportunities websites to determine if there are any additional sources who can provide a VA-Specific, HP VistA Imaging Training program at a fair and reasonable price.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

 
1.  Identify the agency and contracting activity.

This justification is executed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Acquisition Service-Frederick on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Policy and Planning (OPP).

2.  Nature/description of the action being approved.

The Government intends to negotiate a sole-source task order with Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc., in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), to continue Functional Organization Manual Task Force support services provided under VA798-11-D-0122 VA798-11-0001. 

This work continues previous services but cannot be considered a logical follow-on in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C)  because the original services were not competed.

3.  Description of supplies/services required to meet the agency's needs.

The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) functional organization manual task force was established to develop a standardized reference vehicle facilitating synchronized and coordinated actions by VA's administrations and staff offices to ensure optimal execution of VA's mission.  The Functional Organization Manual that was developed outlines authorities, responsibilities, and the organizational structure for the Department.  Additionally, the Functional Organization Manual Task Force (FOMTF) identified and defined appropriate roles, missions, and business processes within the Department to establish both a common understanding of, and expectations for, organizational responsibilities.

The purpose of this task is to assist the task force in finalizing VA's Functional Organization Manual.   The contractor shall provide leadership, project management, and technical support to finalize the Functional Organization Manual and interdependencies matrix.  This includes additional IT support to expand the functionality of data repository, smoothing the organizational manual into a more consistent presentation, and providing additional project management support.

This task order will have an estimated performance period of 4/24/2012- 7/23/2012 with no Option periods. The estimated value of this requirement is $150,000.00.  FY12 funds are available.

4.  Identification of the exception to fair opportunity and supporting rationale.

In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.  

Booz Allen Hamilton is familiar and fully integrated into the FOMTF effort.  The work builds off of and utilizes a data repository created, populated, and managed by the contractor. As such, the contractor is familiar with the repository, data, and system.  The work requires editing and enhancing a document developed with the assistance of the contractor. The contractor is familiar with the content and context, including the intent and history of changes.  The effort involves working with an extensive network of representatives from across the Department, relationships that are critical to success in the effort and already built by the contractor.

5.  A determination by the Contracting Officer that anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate pricing and determine the price to be fair and reasonable before awarding the task order.

6.  Any other supporting facts.

None.

7.  Actions the agency may take to remove or overcome barriers that led to the exception to fair opportunity.

Any requests for additional support services to the FOMTF after completion of the manual will be reviewed for work that can be completed by other contractors.
