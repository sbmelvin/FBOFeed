<DESC>Liferaft & Marine Safety Equipment, Inc. The U. S. Department of the Interior, National Business Center, on behalf of Navy Mobile Driving Salvage Unit, Pearl Harbor, HI, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Liferaft & Marine Safety Equipment, Inc. Specifically, Navy Mobile Diving Salvage Unit has a requirement to replace a removable sponson for a rigid hulled inflatable boat. The equipment must be 100% compatible with existing boat sponson. Liferaft & Marine Safety Equipment, Inc., is the only local company that can do this work. If another company is used they will have to ship the entire boat off the island and ship it as bulk, which is not cost effective. Upon completion of service the sponson will be covered by a warranty in the local area. This announcement is published as a Sole Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Pre-solicitation Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST January 30, 2006, will be considered by the Government.  The anticipated award date is February 1, 2006.  POC:  Toni Langhorne, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be e-mailed to Toni Langhorne at toni.langhorne@mms.gov.

<CONTACT>LYNDA MCCARTHY CONTRACT SPECIALIST 7036487336     lmacarthy@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for interpretation of geographic names and other appropriate data from primary and secondary Federal, State, and local maps, and textual material including primary historical documents. The data will be compiled and encoded for the area for the State of New York excluding the urban areas of New York City and Buffalo. The main thrust of this Phase II work for the State of New York project consists of a systematic search of selected documents in order to identify unrecorded name information and to create new name records to add to those assembled during Phase I.  This procedure needs to be completed before a State or territory volume of The National Gazetteer of the United States of America can be published.  It is important that each person researching name information for Phase II be able to interpret topographic maps and to relate point, line, and area symbols among maps of different and varying scales.  Be able to make reliable judgements on feature identification when comparing maps and relating textual description  to map symbols on sketch maps for accurate identification on the modern large-scale topographic maps. An understanding of how people use and apply geographic names to the landscape is useful. Should understand how proper names are applied to symbols by map editors and the limitations inherent in the process. Knowledge of the geography and history of the area being worked will greatly improve a researcher's ability to interpret data. Part 1 involves the collection of name data on a master set of work maps. Parts 2 and 3 require the transfer and conversation of both the annotated and printed map data into machine readable form for inclusion into the National Geographic Names Data Base. The Government will provide data entry software developed by the GNIS staff specifically for the program. The NAICS code is 541360. The expected performance period is 48 months from date of award. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. This solicitation will be issued on or about January 26, 2006 and will close at 3:00PM Eastern Standard Time on February 28, 2006.  For a copy of the solicitation (06ERSS0010), please visit www.fedbizops.gov or http://ideasec.nbc.gov.   All vendors who wish to submit a proposal must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration website at www.ccr.gov.   The planned award date is on or about March 28, 2006. The point of contact for this procurement is Lynda L. McCarthy at lmccarthy@usgs.gov.  Please email questions.  Phone calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA), herein after referred to as the Government, is an independent executive branch federal agency created by the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-33; 111 Stat.712). The Agency’s mission is to increase public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community. SCOPE:  The Contractor shall provide on-site services, monitor and effectively coordinate the Domestic Violence referral process for CSOSA, facilitate alternative forms of Domestic Violence services (i.e., assessments, staffing, liaison work with public providers) for CSOSA; and monitor and coordinate the Domestic Violence referral process. The Contractor’s services are intended to facilitate the timely assessment and/or evaluation of CSOSA clients, either court ordered into the Domestic Violence Supervision Unit for an evaluation or supervision, have a history of Domestic Violence offenses, or demonstrate behavior that suggests Domestic Violence services are warranted. Upon the offender referral to the Domestic Violence Supervision Unit, the Contractor shall, in general,: a. coordinate the Domestic Violence referral process; b. facilitate case management in conjunction with the Domestic Violence supervision, and Domestic Violence Consultants; c. monitor response times to internal/external requests for Domestic Violence assessments and evaluations; and d. monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of services for quality assurance purposes.  The Contractor shall also perform a variety of administrative functions, such as, but not limited to: a. coordinate and prepare daily assessment and evaluation schedules of offenders referred to the Domestic Violence units; b. facilitate the scheduling of pre-treatment Domestic Violence and Domestic Violence aftercare groups; c. assist in the compilation of offender treatment plans; d. schedule intake interviews and assist in the preparation of documentation related to the offender’s treatment needs and requirements; e. assist in the compilation of statistical analysis and development of reports which include information on cost, number of offenders, types of treatment, treatment timelines, and other information requested by management.  DELIVERABLES: Upon the offender admission into the Domestic Violence Supervision unit, the Contractor shall maintain evaluation/assessment/treatment schedules specific to offender treatment plans.  These record shall reflect Domestic Violence services scheduled and provided as directly related to the offender treatment plan. The Contractor shall also furnish a progress activity report to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative no later than ten (10) calendar days after the completion of each month. These reports are short status reports, to inform the Government of significant events, problems and changes associated with the progress of the work.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance shall begin from date of award through September 30, 2006.  The work schedule is from Monday through Friday (excluding Sundays and Federal holidays).  SECURITY CLEARANCE:  Contractor personnel utilized under this award shall submit to a Government background investigation prior to performing work onsite at the CSOSA facility.  The intent and purpose of this investigation is to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful work completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior.  Contractor employees must be U.S. citizens, or be lawfully permitted to reside in the United States and possess a valid work permit.  Contractor employee shall not begin work until the appropriate background checks are conducted and approved by the CSOSA Office of Security. When a preliminary background check on an individual has been determined to be favorable, the Office of Security will issue an interim employment security approval to the Office of Procurement, who in turn will notify the Contractor.  Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a CSOSA facility.  TYPE OF CONTRACT:  The Government intends to issue a firm, fixed price award for a base period and four one-year option periods.  REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL:  The RFP shall be issued on or about the November 30, 2005. Source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15 shall be utilized for the award of the planned contract, using a trade-off between technical and price. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s), however, firms are required to price all option years to be considered for award. Past performance will also be considered in making the award determination.  The RFP will be available ONLY on the Internet at the FedBizzOpps website: http://www.fbo.gov  The proposal closing date/time will be stated in the RFP, along with specific proposal submittal requirements and evaluation factors for award.

<DESC>Contract Extension  SYNOPSIS:  NOTICE OF INTENT The U. S. Department of Energy, Savannah River Operations Office, published a sources sought /request for information synopsis in June 2005, reference solicitation number DE-RI09-05SR22470, announcing the planning for a competion for a contract for management and operation of the Savannah River Site. The current contract with Washington Savannah River Company, LLC, (WSRC) for management and operation of the site expires December 31, 2006. On December 16, 2005, DOE issued its general Acquisition Strategy in which DOE indicated its intention to conduct two major contract competitions: (1) a full and open competition for a site management and operating (M&O) contract, including operation of the Savannah River National Laboratory but excluding operation of the liquid waste system; and, (2) a full and open competition for a contract for operation of the Liquid Waste system to be awarded after the site M&O contract.  In effecting this acquisition strategy, DOE will need to extend the Liquid Waste and supporting activities portion of the existing contract with WSRC for a period of time in order to facilitate competition. This announcement begins to implement that Acquisition Strategy. In order for the Department to conduct a full and open competition and award a successor contract for the Liquid Waste scope of work, the Department intends to non-competitively extend the liquid waste (and associated support) portion of the existing contract with WSRC for twelve months.  The extension is required to provide uninterrupted support while the procurement is completed. Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)] the Department has determined that only one responsible source exists to satisfy the agency requirements for the period of time needed to conduct the full and open competition for the liquid waste services. See Government-wide numbered note 22.

<DESC>TO ALL CONTRACT HOLDERS UNDER THE FSS SCHEDULE 70 

•	The Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) requires an Agile Mobile Media (AMM) to replace DLIS’s FED LOG CD-ROM and DVD Product.  The AMM will have the advantage of a modern data structure, and extend the presentation of the data into the client-application space.  The mobile media will enhance the capabilities currently provided via DLIS’s FED LOG CD-ROM and DVD Product.  The rationale is to provide customers with a product that equals and mimics Web behavior and appearance, but operates in off-line operations and in environments where connectivity is non-existent, minimal, or compromised.  There are no known, existing systems like this.  Interested sources need to identify/indicate the availability/status/schedule of any potential solutions.  Identify risk areas or categories and the severity of each.  Provide a brief (not more than five pages) White Paper on potential solutions and provide sufficient background to enable the Government to evaluate impact on the acquisition strategy and finalize the requirement.  Specify if the vendor has the capability to provide this solution under an existing GSA Schedule, or government contract such as SEWP, GWAC, etc.  To receive full consideration responses are due by email to alexander.mavroukakis@gsa.gov the contract specialist by January 17, 2006.  Every effort will be made to review responses received after that date.  All information received will be Procurement Sensitive and not released to any organization or company outside the Government.  This RFI neither constitutes a Request for Proposal nor does it restrict the Government to a specific acquisition approach.  This RFI should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary and any response submitted by interested firms will be viewed without prejudice.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e)…”Responses to these notices (RFIs) are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.

Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/ or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>BAA 06 - The Navy is seeking to develop advanced propulsion technologies that are applicable to augmented and non-augmented turbofan/turbojet engines, turboprop/turboshaft engines;  to develop advanced materials to support propulsion components technologies for application in high performance gas turbine engines; to develop propulsion and power system prognostic, diagnostic, and health monitoring technologies to improve aircraft safety, reliability, maintainability, affordability, and availability; and to develop and demonstrate advanced power system technologies that will significantly improve power density, available power, efficiency, reliability, readiness, service life, environmental compliance, safety-of-flight, and ownership costs.  Also, Naval ship and shore activities currently utilize the Combined Contaminated Fuel Detector (CCFD) and other shipboard compatible tests for determining the acceptability of a fuel for acceptance/ issue.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) encourages educational institutions, Small Business Concerns (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Business concerns (SDBs),  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Women Owned Businesses, and Minority Institutions (MIs), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business concerns to submit research proposals for consideration.


TWO STEP BAA PROCESS

White Papers

NAVAIR uses a "Two Step" BAA evaluation process. Offerors must first submit White Papers (WPs), giving an overview (as applicable) of the technical approach, risks, milestones, and cost estimate. The purpose of an WP is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest.  Due to a volatile budget environment, interested offerors should first contact the technical points of contact to ensure that interest and funding exists for new awards. Offerors of those WPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a Formal Cost and Technical Proposal. An invitation does not assure an offeror of a subsequent contract award. For more information, please see BAA Guide which shortly will be posted at www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for high temperature reusable surface insulation test samples to support low Earth orbit (LEO) heat shield thermal protection system (TPS) material testing for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) project.   NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Boeing Integrated Defense Systems in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The specific samples to be procured are Boeing BRI-18 TPS materials and reaction cured glass (RCG) coating for reusable surface insulation (RSI) tile material.  In order to survive the LEO flight reentry environments a high density, currently human-rated ceramic tile TPS material that is well characterized and meets a systems level requirement of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8 is required.  This level requires that the actual system has been considered “flight qualified” through test and demonstration (ground or flight).  The BRI-18 material and RCG coating meet these requirements as they have been certified for application on critical lower surface Space Shuttle Orbiter TPS penetration areas. To purchase samples from another contractor would require a substantial development effort to obtain a certified thermal protection material for human spacecraft.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 30, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing Request For Proposal Number R-CHI-00808 in support of the HUD Headquarters, Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), Program Evaluation Division.  One contract is expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation for collection and analysis of administrative data/records of the Moving To Opportunity (MTO) Demonstration Program.  The MTO program implemented an experimental design to allow measurement of the impact on poor families of moving from high poverty public and assisted housing in five large cities to low poverty neighborhoods through the use of a housing voucher. HUD has continued to track these families to allow for this final impact evaluation. The base contract is for the final impact evaluation. This evaluation involves a base contract and two options. This procurement is being issued on a negotiated basis. The contractor will develop data matching agreements with States to obtain unemployment insurance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and food stamp records for the Moving To Opportunity (MTO) sample.  HUD will provide the data match to its housing assistance data systems. The contractor will analyze these data to report on the impact of the demonstration on employment rates, wages and TANF, Food Stamp, and housing assistance participation rates. Option 1 provides for in-person data collection and a report on a sub-sample of households using the instrument designed in the base contract. Option 2 provides for an expansion of the sample of households to supplement the data being used for the option 1 analysis and report.  The base contract has a duration of 72 weeks due to the often-prolonged time periods to negotiate data agreements with States.  Option 1 would add 84 weeks to the contract. Option 2 would run concurrent with Option 1. If option 1 and/or Option 2 are executed the total contract period would be 156 weeks (three years). This procurement is unrestricted. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541720 (Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities) and the size standard is $6 million, average for the last three years. A cost-reimbursement type contract is expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation, however the Government reserves the right to award the most appropriate type of contract. The solicitation package will be available on or about 15 days form this notification and proposals will be due on or about 45 days from this announcement. Special Announcement: This notice will be posted on HUD’s Internet Home Page since HUD posts all required notices of its contracting opportunities at http//www.hud.gov/offices/cpo/Index.cfm  Potential offerors who download copies of solicitations from HUD’s Home Page Contracting Opportunities or FedBizOpps will not automatically receive any amendments to those solicitations. You are advised to check back frequently to see if HUD has issued any amendments to solicitations you have obtained. Hard copies of this solicitation may be obtained by writing to: Wayne Bernacki, Contract Specialist, HUD Contracting Operations Branch, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Room 2517, Chicago Illinois 60604-3507 or you may contact Wayne Bernacki at 312/886-2760, extension 2505.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, intends to negotiate, on behalf of the Physical and Chemical Properties Division, with Microcal LLC of Northampton, MA, for an Isothermal Titration Calorimeter, and a Differential Scanning Calorimeter with Fixed-in-place, Twin Cells.  Projects shared by the Physical and Chemical Properties Division and the Biosciences Division will utilize both of these calorimeters.
 
NIST currently owns and operates a Microcal VPITC Isothermal Titration Calorimeter and a Microcal VPDSC Differential Scanning Calorimeter.  This equipment has been used and is currently used for work on projects shared by the Physical and Chemical Properties Division and the Biosciences Division.

Sole Source Determination is based on the following: Work on the current project and future work depends upon NIST’s ability to exchange parts between instruments, and perform identical measurement operations side-by- side.  Therefore, it is essential that parts, data-analysis software, instrument control-software operating files, personnel training, and the pressure perturbation hardware of the new instrumentation be 100% compatible and interchangeable with the existing calorimetry equipment and with NIST’s existing data files and programs.  

Preliminary studies for the specific project for which the Physical and Chemical Properties Division is requesting the purchase of equipment, were performed using NIST's existing Microcal equipment.  Due to NIST's previous investment of 
resources in these biochemical/biophysical calorimeters and in the parts and expertise required to operate them, only the identical equipment, manufactured by Microcal, will ensure      data compatibility, and furthermore, the continued integrity of data and project outcomes.  

Microcal has no distributors, therefore, they are the only source who can provide the required isothermal titration calorimeter and the differential scanning calorimeter with      fixed-in-place, twin cells.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by January 20, 2005, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The solicitation issue date has been changed to 12 Jan 06; the expected closing date has been changed to 26 Jan 06. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source purchase order to ORE Offshore Limited, 4 Little Brook Road, West Wareham, MA 02676, for the acquisition of one (1) Trackpoint II Plus navigation and positioning system.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The Trackpoint II Plus is one of the integrated system components of the new PINS V5 that is presently under development and near delivery.  No other underwater navigation and positioning can be substituted in its place since the PINS V5 software was written to specifically interface with that system.  If another system were to be substituted in its place it would be an enormous cost and would cause a tremendous delay in the delivery schedule.  ORE Offshore is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Trackpoint II Plus system.  NAICS Code is 334511, FSC Code is 6605, SBA Size Standard is 750.

<DESC>The solictation issue date has been changed to 12 Jan 06; the expected closing date has been changed to 26 Jan 06. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Northrop Grumman (Cutting Edge Optronics Division), Cutting Edge Optronics, 20 Point West Blvd, St. Charles, MO. 63301 for the acquisition of contractor support to retrofit two lasers for the Rapid Mine Clearance System (RAMICS) with laser flow control switches.  The purpose of the retrofits is to allow for monitoring of the coolant flow to allow the laser to shut off in case of abnormal conditions.  Contractor support is also required for testing to verify that the laser still meets its original operating parameters and that no damage occurs to the laser when coolant is removed from the laser.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  Northrop Grumman is the sole developer and producer of the RAMICS Laser Control Switch.  Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to modify the RAMICS system, test, and properly update the d!  ocumentation, Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the required engineering and documentation support.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA 93042-5001  plans to modify and existing Time and Material, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to procure on other than full and open competition from Hamilton Sundstrand , One Hamilton Road, Windsor Locks, CT 06096-1010, additional Contractor Engineering Technical Services (CETS) in support of the H-46, H-53 & H-60 aircraft; the E-2/C-2 and P-2 aircraft including the E-2/C-2: T-56-A-425/427 engines and associated torque meters and equipment; Hamilton Standard – 54450-1 and NP-2000 propellers and associated equipment; and P-3: C-130 propellers and associated equipment.  This effort will be performed for the Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Command (NATEC) at the NATEC facility in Cherry Point, NC.  The existing contract has a one-year base period with four, one-year options.  Hamilton Sundstrand is the only source with the technical support personnel capable and familiar with the systems able to perform the services including developing solutions to problems not readily resolved in the field.  No other firm possesses the required data and technical representatives with expertise on these systems.  The government does not possess the required data, knowledge of equipment modifications, or engineering expertise, which precludes the use of a competitive procurement.  No solicitation will be offered because this is a modification.  Award of a modification is expected on 1 March 2006, and the contract will continue through 30 September 2008 if all options are exercised.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  Send responses to: Attn: Gary Trimble, Contracts Department, Code 25430000E, NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, 575 "I" Ave., Bldg 65, Suite 1, Point Mugu, CA 93042 or via E-mail to gary.trimble@navy.mil. The offer must have complete and detailed information; an outline of previous CETS efforts including specific services previously performed or being performed in the listed CETS area; specific resumes of representatives detailing their qualifications and any other available descriptive literature.

<DESC>Provide A/E Services to include site investigation, design development, drawings and specifications, cost estimates, construction period services and site visits.  Work shall include, but not be limited to installing a plate-and-frame heat exchanger into the chilled water and condenser water piping loops for the main chiller.  When the ambient wet-bulb temperture is low enough, the heat exchanger transfers heat from the chilled water returning to the evaporator to the condenser water returning from the cooling tower.  Pre-cooling the chilled water before it enters the evaporator lessens the cooling burden, reducing the chillers energy usage.  The estimated payback for the initial return on investment is 3.6 years.  Work under this project will include mechanical and electrical engineering design.  The scope is intended to describe the project in general and is not limited to the aformentioned.  The estimated construction budget is between $100,000-$250,000.  The area of consideration for this acquisition is restricted to firms within 50 driving mile radius of the VA Medical Center, Wilkes-Barre.  Interested firms must submit two (2) copies of SF330 with appropriate documentation to Contracting Officer (693/049B), VAMC, 1111 East End Blvd., Wilkes-Barre, PA  18711 by close of business February 10, 2006.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing market research to identify the capability of any firms that can provide applied technologies and/or processes for decontamination of buildings and outdoor areas following dispersion of radioactive particulates in an urban setting, such as from terrorist use of a radiological dispersal device (RDD).  The long-range goal is to establish decontamination methods capable of being deployed rapidly and on a large scale to clean up urban field sites. The primary focus of this request for information is to identify decontamination technologies which involve minimally destructive surface cleaning and effluent capture (e.g. vacuum-assisted brushing), aqueous and non-aqueous surface washing, and deployment tooling capable of providing extended-reach and/or remote access to large areas and multi-story buildings.  A secondary focus is to identify potential technologies/processes applicable for detection, characterization, and/or immobilization of radioactive contamination, and disposal of radioactive waste resulting from decontamination.  Emphasis will be placed on existing or experimental technologies or processes which could be modified to perform radiological decontamination as described above, and deployed in the near term.  Based on the information gathered, a subset of these technologies/processes may be pursued further through one or more Statements of Work using a Request for Proposals (RFP) process or simplified acquisition procedures.

The applicable NAICS Code is 562910.  

Interested parties should respond with information that clearly demonstrates their products, capability, experience and qualifications relative to the aforementioned requirements.    A description of previously developed systems, technologies, and/or processes that can perform the requirements stated above, or that can be modified to perform the requirements, shall be provided, along with reference information.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   In the capabilities statements, contractors must indicate their businesses size and status (i.e. - certified 8(a) firm, small, small disadvantaged, or large business).  Responses to the above should be submitted electronically via e-mail to the attention of Sandy Savage at savage.sandra@epa.gov no later than February 13, 2006, 3:00 p.m. EST.

The Government is issuing thi s RFI to obtain information from industry which would permit a feasibility assessment of achieving the PTDS capability within the timeframe stated and to assist the Government in determining the best acquisition strategy for accomplishing this objective. All interested firms that possess the capabilities and facilities addressed herein are encouraged to respond to this RFI by providing a White Paper with the information specified in the last paragraph, on or before 1700 hours, fourteen (14) calendar days f rom release of RFI.  Responses may be submitted as written responses to OPM RUS, Bldg. 423, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703; or submitted electronically to Mr. Paul Ciolek at 732 427-6942, email: Paul.Ciolek@us.army.mil.  Technical questions regarding this RFI may  be addressed to Mr. Paul Ciolek or MAJ Daryl Harp at 732 427-5511 or email: Daryl.M.Harp@us.army.mil Product Manager for Robotic and Unmanned Sensors (PM RUS), in support of the Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), is seeking information and sources to develop a strategy for future deployments, and possible procurement of additional systems, fielding, operation , support equipment for the systems, training, associated spares, pre and post deployment technical support of an updated multi-mission version of PTDS, that became operational in theater in October 2004. There exists a threat to coalition and security force aircraft, personnel, facilities, civilians, and infrastructure in theater from Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), Man Portable Air Defense Missiles (MANPAD), mortars, rockets, rocket propelled grenade (RPG), crew served weaponry and small arms.  MANPAD, small arms and crew served anti-aircraft weapon systems pose a specific threat to deployed airborne platforms operating in theater.  As a result, a need exists to detect direct and indirect fire threats particularly in the vicinity of airfields, fixed based encampments, forward operating locations, and other facilities in support of rapid reaction security response forces in the area of operation (AO).   PTDS provides both a stand-alone capability and a capability to interoperate with other systems providing a fully integrated persistent surveillance and dissemination capability that provides rapid reaction security response forces the ability to find, fix , track, target, and engage these threats against counter-insurgency personnel, civilians, facilities, and infrastructure in specifically designated areas in theater.  PTDS is a system consisting of a tethered aerostat equipped with a high-resolution, multi-spectral (including electro-optic/infrared (EO/IR) and/or image-intensified modalities) payload integrated through the Interim Distributed Common Ground System-Army ( I-DCGS-A) (AKA the Joint Services Work Station) with a variety of cueing sensors including Firefinder Radars, AN/TPQ-36 and 37, Weapons Surveillance System (WSS), and the Unattended Transient Acoustic MASINT System (UTAMS).  These systems are used to cue t he PTDS payload to targets in order for PTDS to provide a near-real-time 'eyes on target' capability.   The initially fielded PTDS used the Inter-Brigade Communication System (IBCS) later named Secure Mobile Router (SMR) as its 'secure' wireless backbone communications and networking system.  Replacement equipment for the IBCS based wireless network using a Type 1 encryption embedded into the host and certified by NSA as well as wired links using secure fiber optic cables will be req uired.  PTDS shall have a backbone ground-based secure wireless communication and networking system and fiber optic system capability to link sensor, fire control, and counter-insurgency forces together; transmitting a common operating picture (COP) to counter-ins urgency forces to locate, identify, and engage the enemy. It must be capable of passing and receiving information from the Joint Services Workstation.  PTDS software must fall under the current DOD format version requirements.  PTDS shall be integrated with the Persistent Surveillance Dissemination System of Systems (PSDS2) and may utilize the TACTICOMP personal digital assistant (PDA) component previously integrated with the PSDS2 system.    PTDS shall be capable of performing its 'eyes on target' mission and provide a target marking/designation capability via laser illuminator/designator to aid counter-insurgent forces.  PTDS shall be capable of providing an inclement weather, day/night, 360 degree detection, surveillance, and target marking capability.  It must be capable of detecting hostile fire, providing target coordinates to appropriate command and control/fire contr ol centers, and be capable of marking/designating ground targets for counter-insurgency forces for engagement. PTDS shall also be capable of receiving target coordinates from appropriate Command and Control (C2)/Fire Control Centers so its sensors can be queued to the target, maintain surveillance of the target, and be capable of marking (illuminating)/designating the target for counter-insurgency forces.  It must have the ability to maintain persistent surveillance and monitor activity in its area of operation (i.e. cantonment sites over an extended period of time).    PTDS shall be a self-contained, self-sufficient, highly mobile and transportable system the major components of which consist will consist of but are not limited to a tethered aerostat (with mobile mooring and transporting capability), a sensor payload, a  communications capability, an internal inertial navigation capability and means to determine sensor pointing relative to true north, a means to obtain and provide target coordinates, and a means to mark/designate a target for counter-insurgency forces.   PTDS shall be fully sustainable in theater with operator training, and sufficient logistical support to fulfill its mission for a 1 year period following deployment.  It must be capable of being set-up, broken-down, and transported for operations at geogra phically separated locations within a reasonable period of time contingent on the needs of the user with a minimal manpower and personnel.   The PTDS aerostat with full payload shall be capable of loitering at altitudes at or greater than 2500 ft above ground level (AGL) at temperatures characteristic of summer in the Iraqi environment.  It shall be capable of loitering and performing its missi on for a much longer duration of time than can be provided by fixed wing or rotary aircraft. Interested parties are requested to provide a White Paper addressing the previously defined PTDS operational requirements and shall address the following: 1.	Corporate capabilities, past and current relevant performance information,  available facilities and assets to perform the intended effort within a rapid turn-around time should the effort materialize. 2.	Technical and management approach for executing a PTDS program to include a  detailed design; procurement of devices and the integration of sensor components; contractor test and an operational test and integration at a government facility; all requisite supporting documentation; and, operation and sustainment in theater for a peri od up to 12 months.  This support shall be in the form of a toll-free (800) phone number and an email address. 3.	The recommended aerostat size, sensor and communications package, mobile  platform, etc. 4.	The manning requirements to set-up, tear-down, transport, maintain and operate, and also the training requirements. 5.	The existence of a contract to provide manning requirements in DOD Hostile  Environments. 6.   Recommended tether and aerostat air safety measures, and air traffic control and airspace control measures to prevent friendly aircraft from colliding with the aerostat or severing the tether. 7.   Aerostat equipment such as an emergency locator transmitter and auto-deflation  measures to facilitate a search and recovery mission if required. 8.   A cost estimate on a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to accomplish each of the notional requirements outlined in the paragraphs above. 9.   A supporting program schedule that represents your 'low risk' approach to  meeting the objectives outlined above. 10. An assessment of the associated risks for this program and respective risk  mitigation approaches. 11. Name, telephone number, fax number, street address and e-mail address for  program, technical and cost points of contact information. Interested parties may obtain a copy of the PTDS Architecture by contacting MAJ Daryl Harp at 732 427-5511 or email: Daryl.M.Harp@us.army.mil; or, Mr. Paul Ciolek at 732 427-6942 or email: Paul.Ciolek@us.army.mil. Commencing approximately 18 work days from release of the RFI, the Government may afford interested parties an opportunity to discuss the contents of their White Papers during an industry one-on-one session where it is envisioned the parties will engage in  an active information exchange dialogue to aid in the governments feasibility assessment.  It is anticipated that any such sessions would not exceed 4 hours and will take place at PM RUS at Fort Monmouth, NJ.

<SUBJECT>Hanford Central Plateau Acquisition
<DESC>INTRODUCTION The purpose of this document is to provide industry and other interested parties with preliminary information as the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) develops its detailed plans for the Hanford Central Plateau Acquisition. This document is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  All interested parties are encouraged to frequently access the DOE E-Center for information. The official website for the Hanford Central Plateau Acquisition is the DOE E-Center at www.pr.doe.gov.  The DOE E-Center will be the sole distribution medium for all information regarding this acquisition.  All interested parties are encouraged to frequently access this website for information.  DOE will not distribute paper or other forms of information regarding this acquisition. SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE HANFORD CENTRAL PLATEAU SCOPE Hanford Central Plateau cleanup of legacy waste includes three major overarching objectives:  safe work performance that delivers on cleanup commitments, protection of human health and the environment, and effective use and stewardship of Federal resources.  The major elements of scope for the Hanford Central Plateau include: â€¢ deactivation, decontamination, decommissioning, and demolition (D4) of 970 surplus facilities across the Central Plateau; â€¢ disposition of five â€˜canyonâ€™ facilities (former radiochemical processing and supporting facilities located on the Central Plateau); â€¢ remediation of 850 waste sites, including burial grounds and liquid waste discharge sites (cribs, ditches, and ponds); â€¢ management and remediation, as appropriate, of six groundwater plumes; â€¢ operation of solid waste disposal facilities (such as the new Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF) and Central Waste Complex (CWC)); â€¢ operation and closure of the 149 single- and 28 double-shell waste tanks and the supporting infrastructure for tank waste storage, retrieval, treatment, and disposal/storage; â€¢ management, storage, and/or disposal of multiple, highly radioactive materials (such as cesium and strontium capsules, and spent nuclear fuel (SNF)); â€¢ operation of the new tank waste treatment and immobilization facilities, and supplemental technologies (currently under construction and/or demonstration); and â€¢ operation, maintenance, curtailment, and closure of the site infrastructure and support services (water, power, sanitary waste, and miscellaneous systems and services). HANFORD CENTRAL PLATEAU ACQUISITION APPROACH DOE has developed an acquisition approach for the Hanford Site Central Plateau, and will use the competitive acquisition process described under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 to award three new contracts.  The acquisition approach is designed to integrate the needs of both Richland Operations Office (RL) and Office of River Protection (ORP) into a group of coordinated contracts that will provide continued cleanup of legacy waste on the Hanford Site Central Plateau. Three new major prime contracts will replace the existing Project Hanford Management Contract (PHMC) and the Tank Farm Operations Contract (TFC) at Hanford, and include: â€¢ Hanford Mission Support Contract for information management, site utilities, and a broad range of site services managed by RL; â€¢ Waste Material Storage and Disposition Mission Contract that will be managed by RL; and â€¢ Tank Farm Operations and Closure Mission Contract that will be managed by ORP. A phased approach will be used to implement this acquisition.  The Hanford Mission Support Contract will be acquired first, followed by the Waste Material Storage and Disposition, and Tank Farm Operations and Closure acquisitions. Following the acquisition of these three major prime contracts, future contracts and/or task orders for individual projects would be placed for surplus facility D4; remediation; and tank farm projects. To implement this acquisition approach, the PHMC and TFC will be extended under existing contracts until the mission support and mission acquisitions are completed.  The duration of the extension period will support completing the new acquisitions and the transition to the three new contracts.  Contract extensions will be structured to sequentially perform and transition scope through the extension period.  The acquisition approach does not include the existing Waste Treatment Plant Contract and the River Corridor Closure Contract (RCCC). Summary Description of the Hanford Mission Support Contract: The Hanford Mission Support Contract includes information management, site utilities, and a broad range of site services: â€¢ information technology, telecommunications, and federal information management; â€¢ operation and maintenance of site utilities such as water, electrical, and roads; â€¢ safeguards and security, emergency services, analytical laboratories, and radiological dosimetry; â€¢ groundwater monitoring and management; â€¢ management services such as administration of contractor employee pension and benefits, site-wide integrated planning and interface management, and property/real estate management; and â€¢ project planning to define and negotiate cleanup end states, and support DOE in preparing and executing future task order contracts. Under the existing Hanford contract structure, the majority of these services have been assigned to the PHMC to provide linkages with current operations and support mission changes. Summary Description of the Waste Material Storage and Disposition Mission Contract: The Waste Material Storage and Disposition includes all non-tank farm activities  required to receive, retrieve, characterize, certify, package, treat, store, and dispose/ship legacy and newly generated wastes, including: â€¢ waste treatment, storage, and disposal including liquid effluent treatment, mixed waste treatment, and low level and mixed waste disposal (including the IDF, Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility (ERDF) (following completion of the RCCC), Waste Receiving and Processing Facility (WRAP), and CWC); â€¢ SNF and immobilized high-level waste (IHLW) storage, completion of SNF sludge removal, and special nuclear material (SNM) storage, and possible off-site waste shipments to Hanford; and â€¢ transuranic (TRU) retrieval (including suspect TRU). Under the existing Hanford contract structure, the majority of these activities have been assigned to the PHMC to provide linkages with current operations and the ability to address emerging new scope. Summary Description of the Tank Farm Operations and Closure Mission Contract: The Tank Farm Operations and Closure Mission Contract includes  operations activities necessary to continue to retrieve, treat, store, and dispose Hanford tank waste, projects within the operating facilities, and tank farm closure, including: â€¢ maintain and operate the tanks farms, the 242-A evaporator, and the 222-S building in a safe, environmentally compliant and stable configuration; â€¢ operate tank waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities; â€¢ retrieve tank waste, continuing single-shell tank retrievals, and retrieve and package contact handled TRU tank waste; â€¢ develop a comprehensive, integrated tank waste treatment plan for the future; â€¢ treat and dispose of tank waste; and â€¢ close Tank Farms. Under the existing Hanford contract structure, these activities have been assigned to the TFC. OTHER AREAS OF INTEREST Small Business Opportunities: Opportunities for small business were carefully considered in the proposed acquisition approach; this provides for a three-tier approach: potential small business set asides within the mission support contract, meaningful small business subcontracting opportunities within the prime contracts, and defined future small business opportunities using the existing DOE Office of Environmental Management (EM) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts with small business and new small business contracts.  A key feature of the acquisition approach is to establish a project planning capability within the mission support contract to provide the flexibility to define and effectively break-out work for small business. Contractor Employee Pension and Other Benefits: The RFPs for these acquisitions will reflect the Departmentâ€™s standard practice under which transferring incumbent employees would transition to employment under the new contract with equivalent pay for equivalent positions.  With respect to the pension plan component of the benefits package, the RFPs will make it clear that contractor employees who are currently participating in the site pension program and are subsequently employed by the selected contractors under the new contracts will remain in their existing pension plan (pursuant to plan eligibility requirements and applicable law); that is, â€œif youâ€™re in, youâ€™ re in.â€  However, the RFPs would also require the contractors selected for award to provide market- based pension plans for new, contractor employees hired after award.  With respect to medical benefits, the Department is currently assessing its policies and the RFPs will reflect, or will be modified to reflect, those policies as concluded by the Department. Contractor Employment Levels: Hanford is a closure site and contractor employment will trend down in the future.  Each new contractor will be required to establish the required organizational structure, skill mix, and staffing levels for successful contract performance.  New contracts will require that incumbent employees be fairly considered for continued employment under existing and new contracts. The Department recognizes the contributions of the existing contractor workforce to safe work performance; as part of the transition to closure contracts with scope broader than traditional radioactive waste management activities, the Department will continue to retain existing trained and qualified workers and develop new workforce capabilities.

All visitors must be US Citizens.  Visitors are to bring hardhats and must wear steel-toe shoes.  
We will meet by the guard shack in the parking lot adjacent to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s fenced compound on Kirtland AFB at 0830 on Thursday 26 January 2006.  All visitors are to enter through Kirtland AFB’ Gibson gate.  After entering the Gibson gate, continue on Gibson past Pennsylvania, then turn right on Texas Street.  After passing avenues F, G, and H, the DTRA compound will be on your left.  Turn left into the parking lot and find LCDR Phillips who will be waiting outside the guard shack.  We will wait no more than 5 minutes before beginning the site visit so please ensure you arrive on time.  If you have extenuating circumstances that may cause a delay, please notify LCDR Phillips on his cell phone at 505 730 0425 so we don’t leave without you.
All contractors who wish to participate in this site visit must notify LCDR Phillips no later than Friday 20 January 2006 by email (homer.phillips@abq.dtra.mil) to provide him with the full name of each visitor.  LCDR Phillips will create a consolidated list of visitors.  If your name is not on the list, you will not be permitted to enter the base, so please ensure that you provide complete and accurate information.  At the Gibson gate, the driver must notify the gate guard that you are attending DTRA’s A&E Contract Site Visit and that his and his passenger’s names should all be on the guard’s list. Everyone in the vehicle will have to produce a valid ID such as a driver’s license or government ID.  Sam’s cards or credit cards are not acceptable.  In addition, the driver must produce for the guard proof of current insurance and vehicle registration.  Please have it ready as you approach the gate to avoid delays.  
For access to White Sands Missile Range, the second phase of the site visit, DTRA requires additional information for security passes.  Each contractor’s security manager must submit a Visitor’s Request to DTRA’s Security Specialist, SSGT Tina Fahlsing (505-846-8782 tina.fahlsing@abq.dtra.mil) and provide the following information:

The Government Party led by LCDR Phillips will depart the DTRA parking lot shortly after 0830 and proceed to the Chestnut Test Site on Kirtland AFB.  After a brief tour of Chestnut, we will depart directly for White Sands Missile Range.  The drive from Chestnut to the Permanent High Explosives Test Site (PHETS) on White Sands will take approximately 2 hours, and the tour of PHETS may take at least another 1 ½ hours.  It is recommended that visitors bring a vehicle that is capable of off-road driving since not all roads we will be traveling on are paved.  You should bring something to eat and adequate water for a full day away from services and utilities.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Contract Management Office (CMO) intends to award a purchase order to BBN Technologies using FAR Part 6.302.1, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), only one responsible source.  The subject effort is to provide assistance to the CROSSHAIRS system program by utilizing the Boomerang System to enhance CROSSHAIRS.  BBN Technologies created the Boomerang II acoustic bullet detection system.  This system when interfaced with CROSSHAIRS would significantly reduce the overall program difficulty and provide imperative enhancements to the program.  Because BBN developed and controls proprietary information in regard to the Boomerang System, BBN is the single source that has the proprietary knowledge and expertise to expeditiously perform the tasks necessary for the integration efforts. The estimated value of this effort is $99,991.00.   NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting CMO’s requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement may be considered. Responses to posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jennifer Schoen via e-mail at jennifer.schoen@darpa.mil.

	B. Factor 2: Professional Qualifications: 

1. Offerors shall submit a statement of qualifications outlining their firm’s 
capabilities and experience with respect to the effort described herein. The statement of qualifications should describe the personnel and their experience that are directly relevant to this effort. Resumes of proposed personnel shall be submitted with the proposal. Professional staff resumes are not included in the 25-page limitation, but are themselves limited to 3 pages.

		2. Basis of Evaluation: The resumes submitted by the offeror will be evaluated to assess the availability and qualifications of the proposed staff, their experience in similar projects and their capability to fully and professionally accomplish the objectives stated herein. 
	
C. Factor 3: Past Performance: 

1. Offerors must submit descriptions of projects similar in scope, size and
complexity performed during the past three years, including references. Sufficient information should be provided to allow the Government to contact the agencies/organizations served and assess the quality of the services provided. References should be of those individuals the most knowledgeable of the offerors’ past performance and contact information for those references must be accurate and current.

2. Basis of Evaluation: The proposal will be evaluated to assess the performance 
of the offeror with respect to projects similar in scope, size, complexity and relevant subject matter expertise to the work described herein as well as the quality of performance provided under those projects.

	D. Factor 4: Price: Not objectively rated, but considered for reasonableness in the best value determination
    
3.	ADJECTIVAL RATING AND STANDARDS SCALE
Each proposal will be rated based on evaluation of each factor using the following Adjectival Rating and Standards Scale:

OUTSTANDING – Very comprehensive, in-depth, and clear response. Proposal consistently meets this standard with no omissions. Consistently high quality performance can be expected.

EXCELLENT – Extensive, detailed response to all requirements similar to outstanding in quality, but with minor areas of unevenness or spottiness. High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where less than excellent performance might be expected.

GOOD – No deficiencies in the response. Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without major revisions to the proposal.

FAIR – The response generally meets requirements but there is not expectation of better than acceptable performance. Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without major revisions to the proposal.

POOR – The response fails to meet one or more requirements. Deficiencies exist in significant areas but can be corrected during negotiations without major revisions to the proposal or serious deficiencies exist in areas with minor impact.

UNACCEPTABLE – Serious deficiencies exist in significant areas. The proposal cannot be expected to meet the stated requirements without major revisions. The proposal only indicates a willingness to perform in accordance with the requirements document without specifying how or demonstrating the capability to do so. Only vague indications of the required capability are present.

4.	BEST VALUE EVALUATION METHODOLOGY:

Best value evaluations is, in and of itself, a subjective assessment by the Government of the proposed solution that provides the optimal results to the Government, price and other factors considered, Subjectivity is inherent in the process and is the cornerstone of the source selection decision. In an effort to provide insight to the offerors as to the decision making process of the Government, the following information is provided:

Evaluation will be made on two factors – Technical and Price. In the evaluation, technical is significantly more important than price. While price is not as important as Technical, it does have significance to the Government.

In rating the technical proposals, the three factors (Technical Understanding, Professional Qualifications, and Past Performance) are listed in descending order of importance. Technical Understanding is moderately more important than the other two factors combined while Professional Qualifications is slightly more important then Past Performance/Corporate Experience.

Your firm’s submission should reflect and demonstrate an understanding of the Statement of Work and provide sufficient detail to be properly considered. Resumes and qualifications of proposed personnel shall also be provided. Your submission should reflect the quality and experience of proposed personnel at competitive fixed prices. The technical proposal shall not exceed 25 pages in length and single sided. The technical proposal shall include labor mix and hours, but not labor rates. During the technical evaluation, the labor mix and hours, not labor rates, will be evaluated. Price submissions shall be under separate cover and competitive firm fixed priced. Other Direct Costs proposed shall be realistic to the extent that all costs/prices can be fully supported. Resumes, and past performance do not count towards the page limitation. Email is the preferred method of submission.

6. BACKGROUND
WHS/ITMD currently has two Hewlett-Packard servers.  One is a production server and the other is a development server.  These servers have reached their end of life cycle and need to be replaced.  

Production Database Server

The production environment consists of one HP 9000 N400 (N Class) server primarily running HP-UX 11.0 with Oracle 8.1.7 databases that support a variety of custom applications as well as COTS products such as RESUMIX, Business Objects, and TrackIt.

Hardware Platform:  The current server configuration for the N Class server is as follows: two 36 GB internal disks, eight 36 GB Surestore disks, DVD ROM, two Single Port Ultra 2 SCSI HBA’s, three 800 MHz processors, 4 GB of RAM, one 100Base-T LAN adapter, one DDS3 DAT tape drive, rack mounted HP PowerTrust II-MR 4 kW (4.5 kVA) UPS 240v, which are installed in two HP9000 Standard Rack System E41.  The current operating system installed on the server is HP-UX 11.0 with an unlimited user’s license and is not clustered.  

Software Platform:
The HP-UX development environment consists of Oracle 8.1.7 and 9.x.  Backups are performed by CommVault Galaxy version 5.9.0.

Current Usage:  200 GBs of local storage to support the databases with an anticipated increase next year of 400 GBs.  Furthermore, the government anticipates a growth rate of 15 percent per year after FY07.  There four Oracle database instances which serve 36 concurrent users.  On average there are 100 sessions active at any given time with a peak of 200.   

Development Database Server

The development environment mirrors the production environment as stated above.

Production Web Server

Hardware:  The production web server is a Sun Fire 280R that has two 900 MHz processors, 4 GBs RAM, and two 72 GB internal hard drives.  It is running SUN Solaris 8.0.

Software:  Apache 1.3.31, Oracle Client 9.2, CommVault Galaxy version 5.9 (client), OpenSSL 0.9.7i, OpenSSH 4.2p1, mod_perl 1.0, mod_ssl 2.8.25 and later.
 
Current Usage:  60 GB of disk space is currently being consumed.  This server houses a publicly accessible web site that receives approximately 25 K hits per day.  The present server meets the current usage requirement.  However, the government anticipates a 10 % increase each year after FY07.

7.	REQUIREMENTS

Synopsis:

The above attendees met at Harmon Junction and the Authorized Procurement Representative (APR) explained that all questions pertaining to the RFP would be required in writing and directed to the APR who in turn would direct the technical questions to the Technical Representative (TR).  The attendees then drove individually to the Cross M Ranch which houses the pump station and water storage for the Shoal Drilling Site.  The TR stated that SNJV would provide the water which is available from the Cross M Ranch.  The TR stated that SNJV estimated that 15,000 to 30,000 gallons of water will be required per day and in some cases up to 100,000 gallons per day.  The TR stated that the successful subcontractor will be required to transport the water from the Cross M Ranch to the Shoal Drilling site.

A physical inspection of the Shoal Drilling site, which contains the three well pads, was performed.   The TR provided an overview of the Statement of Work, Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS), the seven guiding principles of ISMS and the role of the successful subcontractor management team and expectations of project personnel. Work control issues were discussed by the TR and the roles and responsibilities of the TR representing SNJV.  It was further emphasized and clearly stated that the successful subcontractor would take technical direction from the SNJV TR representative. It was further explained that Desert Research Institute (DRI) would be at the jobsite to serve in an advisory capacity only and any technical direction would come from SNJV technical. 







A short discussion by the TR on the geology of the area occurred which entailed a reiteration of the Statement of Work. 

After approximately two and one half hours all parties departed the site. Listed below are the questions the attendees submitted:

II.  ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF AMENDMENT
The offeror must provide written acknowledgment of this Amendment with submission of proposal. 

Question 1:
The above solicitation does not mention sampling for fungi or bacteria.  These biological contaminants are among the most prevalent contaminants in an HVAC system.  Do you want to sample for these? 
Answer:  No, not at this time.  

Question 2:
How many test areas for formaldehyde, ozone, CO will be required per floor and per building? 
Answer:  Appropriate amount to meet OSHA standards per ft2.

Question 3:
Are every supply and return vent to be tested or just representative vents to be tested?  
Answer:  Representative Vents

Question 4a:
Can I have a listing of the number of air handler units per building? and number of vents to be tested? 
Answer:  We do not have a listing of the number of air handler units in our facilities at this time. 

Answer 4b:  The number of vents tested should be based on the ft2 and meeting the OSHA standards.

Question 5:
Do all of the buildings have to be surveyed within one week or is the one week survey period per building? 
Answer:  We would like to have it all completed within one week, but if this testing time is not adequate, we will work with the vendor to accommodate the period of performance. However, we want the testing to be constant from start to finish.

Question 6:
Our firm measures HVAC flow rates with digital hot wires and anemometers that do not require flow hoods. They can be used with rectangular and circular ducts and have a velocity range of 2.6 to 49 FPS at +- 3%. Are these acceptable for the project? 
Answer:  Not acceptable due to vents being 4'X8"

Question 7:
Are electronic mechanical/building drawings available for each facility? 
Answer:  Yes, we will supply the vendor a disc with copies of each facilities floor plan in a PDF file. We will provide the vendor with the drawings after award of the contract.     






Question 8:
What type of mechanical systems are present in: 

	 Building 1
		 Building 2

Answer:  We do not understand the question.

Answer:
 Building 1-  200 Third St.- 3 rooftop units
		 Building 2 - 320 Avery St.- 3 rooftop units
		 Building 3 - Hintgen Building- 7 rooftop units
		 Building 4 - 19th St. Warehouse- 10 units
		 Building 5 - CAPS Warehouse- 9 units

Question 10:
How large (in ft2) is the Shredder Room at the 19th Street Warehouse? 
Answer:  578ft2

Question 11a:
How many employees are working in the microfilm processing and storage
area at 200 Third Street? 
Answer:  56 employees

Question 11b:
 Does the area occupy all 12,180 square feet of
space on this floor? 
Answer:  Yes  

Question 11c:  
Is there a specific number of personal air samples for
acetic acid you wish to have collected in this location? 
Answer:  Appropriate amount to meet OSHA standards per ft2.

Question 12:
Are travel related costs and per diem to be included in the lump sum base year cost or listed separately?
Answer:  The Government is requesting a firm-fixed price (lump sum), which includes all travel related expenses, for the base year and each option year.  



Question 13:
Is the Agency looking to have all of the air output & return vents measured or can the Contractor randomly test a certain number based upon the size of the occupied space? 
Answer:  The contractor may randomly test a certain number based upon the size of the occupied space.

Question 14:
Is it anticipated that the Contractor can perform the air quality testing in a consecutive time frame (i.e., complete the building spaces one right after the other, on consecutive days)? 
Answer:  Yes

Question 15:
Will an Agency representative assist the Contractor to schedule testing? 
Answer:  Yes

Question 16:
Is it correct to assume that the Scope of Work is requiring a single acetic acid (or peracetic acid) analysis test on the ground floor of the 200 3rd Street facility? 
Answer:  Yes, in room G10.
 
Question 17:
Will blueprints and/or mechanical drawings be available for use onsite during the project and that can be used in reporting? 
Answer:  Yes
 
Question 18:
Do you know the approximate ceiling heights in the various buildings?  We are curious if ladders, scissors lifts, and/or other mechanical means would be needed to reach higher ceilings, especially in the warehouse buildings.  
Answer:  During past testing, we did not use any of the above equipment most of the ceiling throughout our facilities are 8'X6"in height. However, we can supply this equipment if necessary.
