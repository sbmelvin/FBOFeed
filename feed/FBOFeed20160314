In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Government new/unused surplus items may be considered.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC>NASA/AFRC has a requirement for Integrated Atmospheric Measurement System W/2Yr Maintenance. NASA/AFRC intends to purchase the items directly from Desert Research Institute., 755 E. Flamingo Road, Las Vegas, NV 89119. Authority for the requirement is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) Only one responsible source. Justification is based upon the following facts: Contractor holds proprietary rights for the software and no other vendor located that can provide the required support. Based upon the above, utilization of any other provider in lieu of Desert Research Institute for the acquisition of the item would likely result in: a) Any change in the current infrastructure could mean gaps in the data and prevent NASA AFRC from conducting useful research; b) prevent periods of time where&nbsp;gaps will occur c) risk that using the historically collected data would be incompatible with other hardware or where backward search functionality could be impacted using another piece of equipment; d) Loss of the this data would significantly impact NASA AFRC research and the monetary loss associated with this data&nbsp;would not likely be over come by competition. These reasons justify procuring the required services exclusively from Desert Research Institute. <br /><br />The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.<br />&nbsp;<br />Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 17, 2016. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <br /><br />Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.<br />&nbsp;<br />All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.<br />&nbsp;<br />NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

<DESC><p>NSN(s):&nbsp; 4810-00-529-4083<br />Item Description: VALVE, DIRECTIONAL FLOW CONTROL</p>
<p>Manufacturer's Code and Part Number:<br />Hydro-Aire, Inc. (81982)<br />P/N 21899</p>
<p>Unit of Issue:&nbsp; EA</p>
<p>Quantity:&nbsp; 16</p>
<p>Various Increments Solicited:&nbsp; 1-9, 10-18 &amp; 19-30</p>
<p><br />Destination Information:&nbsp; FOB Origin, Inspection and Acceptance at Origin<br />First Destination Transportation (FDT) applies.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule:&nbsp; 328 days</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered.</p>
<p>The solicitation (RFP) will be available in DIBBS on its issue date of 03/29/16 at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Small Business size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>TYPE OF SET-ASIDE:&nbsp; unrestricted</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data;&nbsp; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis - Notice of Intent to Sole Source
<p>This synopsis is hereby issued in accordance with FAR Part 5.203 in response to the mandatory requirement for a 15 day notification. The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the Food and Drug Administration's intent to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price sole source contract with Virginia Tech Eastern Shore Agricultural Research and Extension Center (ESAREC), located at 33446 Research Drive, Painter, VA 23420 for the purpose investigating the impact of pathogen strain on the survival of Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli (E.coli) 0157, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) non-0157, and generic Escherichia coli in manure amended soils under greenhouse conditions.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate solely with VIRGINIA TECH EASTERN SHORE AGRICULUTRAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CENTER per FAR 6.302-1, as no other source of supplies will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>-Previous field trails performed by ESAREC involved testing for Sen in water, amended soil, and poultry facilities. Continuity of methods and accessibility to facilities is required for the current sampling and testing results to be validly coupled and statistically analyzed.</p>
<p>-The outbreak strain of SeN has been isolated from the Virginia Tech Eastern Shore Agricultural Research and Extension Center (ESAREC) environment by the FDA over the past three seasons, particularly in the farm ponds.<br />-There is no other location in the USA where Salmonella enterica Newport (SeN) has been found and confirmed to be endemic in the environment of tomato growth. Doing this field trail in another location would necessitate introducing SeN into the environment.</p>
<p>ESAREC will provide the Government with the following services at an anticipated total cost of $ 181,209.00:<br />Conduct greenhouse experiments to collect data on the survival dynamics of;<br /> -15 strains of Salmonella, inoculated into raw poultry manure, amended into two types of soil, and subjected to simulated rain.<br /> -4 strains of generic E. Coli, 10 strains of E. coli 0157, and 4 strains of STEC non-0157, inoculated into raw cattle manure, amended into two types of soil, and subjected to rain.<br /> -Provide raw data and statistical analysis to characterize how survival dynamics varies among the strains evaluated.</p>
<p><br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS, however, interested firms may submit a capability statement in response to the above requirement with pricing information by March 29th, 2016 @ 4:30 PM Local Time to Christopher McGucken, Contract Specialist, Phone: (240) 402-7599, Email: Christopher.McGucken@fda.hhs.gov. A determination not to open competition based responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for maintenance support of its autonomous Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems at NASA GSFC's Greenbelt Facility and GSFC's Wallops Flight Facility (WFF). Both systems support emergency communication requirements, and operations pertaining to routine missions, logistics, safety, environmental, mechanical, information services, facility, and security communications needs. The GSFC Greenbelt facility contains one (1) Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter site operating in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) spectrum. The WFF facility, contains Two (2) RF sites operating in the Very High Frequency (VHF) spectrum.
<p><br />NASA/GSFC intends to continue to contract services with Harris Corporation for maintenance services for the Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems located at GSFC's Greenbelt and WFF facilities. Performance period is for May 14, 2016 through September 13, 2016. Currently, Harris is providing the day-to-day LMR maintenance and support under Contract No. NNG10FG01C. The current vendor provides a workforce with the required training, experience and expertise that allows uninterrupted continuation of mission critical maintenance support and services. Should these services be interrupted, the NASA GSFC facilities will be unable to utilize the IT infrastructure and systems required for maintaining emergency preparedness communication requirements, and operations pertaining to routine missions, logistics, safety, environmental, mechanical, information services, facility, and security communications needs. A follow-on competition is currently underway. If NASA Goddard attempts to procure these services from any other source for the stated interim period, it will impact NASA's mission critical maintenance support and services. The additional time needed for any other source of support to reach the current level of expertise of the current contractor would be unacceptable. Therefore, Harris is considered the only contractor that can meet NASA's needs during this short-term period.</p>
<p>The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort to Ms. Nina Albritton via email at nina.a.albritton@nasa.gov not later than 4:30 p.m. eastern standard time on March 29, 2016.

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT MODIFICATION WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification without providing for full and open competition (Including brand-name) to Blood Systems, Inc. dba Blood Systems Research Institute for the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III) Central Laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</strong></p>
<p>The resultant contract modification will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-87, March 7, 2016.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 15-Contracting by Negotiation at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORITY</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The incumbent Contract No. HHSN268201100001I is for the Central Laboratory of the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III) program. The objective of REDS-III is to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S., affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S., but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. The REDS-III program is comprised of one Central Laboratory, one Data Coordinating Center, four Domestic Hubs, and three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>REDS-III contractors are currently completing Phase 2 of the contract, conducting several study protocols and compiling donor, recipient, and linked databases, and performing laboratory testing. The NHLBI anticipates that the Central Laboratory will be needed until March 14, 2020 to complete the development, review and approval of analyses, presentations and publications based on the research conducted in Phase 2, as well as closure of databases. Additionally, the Government anticipates that the Central Laboratory will be required to execute protocols to evaluate the impact of Zika virus acquisition through blood transfusion</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE, CONTRACT STRUCTURE, AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>The proposed action is a modification to an existing single award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, with cost-reimbursement task orders. The contract modification will increase the maximum ordering value of the IDIQ contract. This modification will not obligate any funds; funds are obligated under task orders that are issued against the base IDIQ contract.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>

Upon establishing the satisfactory operating characteristics of the pods, the Contractor shall then locate the devices in a stationary manner in a geographically diverse pattern in southern California as defined by the NERL/Region 9. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated below may submit a capability statement, which if received within 3 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions and comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Dionne Wright, Contracting Officer, at wright.dionne@epa.gov, and Elaine Scott, Contracting Officer, at scott.elaine@epa.gov.

(5 points)<br />&emsp;<br />INFORMATION REGARDING ANTICIPATED AWARDS RESULTING FROM STAGE 2</p>
<p>Since a contract may result in an award over $500,000, large businesses will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan prior to contract award.</p>
<p>Selection shall be in accordance with the Brooks Act, P.L. 92-582 (40 U.S.C. 1101-1104). After the successful offeror(s) has been selected, the resultant contract award will be dependent on the conclusion of successful negotiations.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award of this contract, the successful offeror(s) must possess, or be eligible to obtain, a Defense Security Service (DSS) Secret Facility Clearance (FCL), with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, DOD 5220.22-M. Personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) at DOS locations must possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by the Defense Security Service (DSS). Additionally, the successful offeror selected for contract award must possess, or immediately obtain an Information System (IS) or standalone computer, approved by DSS, for processing classified information. Performance on this contract will require access to the Department's ProjNet-C, for receipt and transmission of all classified information, and a DSS-approved classified IS for processing classified information. Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with their Stage 2 submissions.</p>
<p>If an uncleared offeror from the Stage 2 short-list is recommended to the Director for selection, the Department of State will sponsor the uncleared firm for an FCL. Firms which form joint ventures must also comply with the above FCL requirements. Each entity comprising the joint venture must be issued an FCL, as well as the joint venture. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.</p>
<p>Contract award cannot be made until the selected firm has been issued at least an Interim Secret FCL. A period of 90 calendar days, from the date of sponsorship, will be allowed for an uncleared contractor to obtain a Secret FCL. If the firm has not obtained the FCL after 90 days, the Government may terminate negotiations with the offeror and may move to select another short-listed firm for award.</p>
<p>Foreign firms are not eligible for FCLs. Only U.S. firms organized and operating in the U.S. or Puerto Rico, or a U.S. possession or trusted territory, are eligible for facility clearances. U.S. firms which are determined to be under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) are not eligible for an FCL unless actions (as directed and approved by DSS) can be taken to effectively negate or reduce associated FOCI risks to an acceptable level. This process often takes more than the 90 calendar days allotted for clearance. Information on the clearance process can be found on the DSS website, at http://www.dss.mil, under Industrial Security.</p>
<p>Certain team subcontractors/consultants may also require FCLs and personnel security clearances. Uncleared team subcontractors/consultants must be sponsored by the short-listed firm, only after that firm receives its own FCL.</p>

<DESC>Overview
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, issues this sources-sought notice as a means of conducting market research to identify interested parties with the resources to manufacture, store, and deliver Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of future procurement. <em>This is not a solicitation</em>.&nbsp;The applicable NAICS code assigned to this procurement is 325414 with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>FMD is arguably the greatest infectious disease threat to the U.S. livestock industry; even a small outbreak would result in devastating economic and animal health consequences. To ensure the safety of its susceptible livestock, the United States is seeking to improve its FMD vaccine preparedness by enhancing its existing stockpile of FMD vaccine.</p>
<p>There are seven recognized serotypes or strains of FMD: A, O, C, Asia-1, SAT-1, SAT-2, and SAT-3. From these seven serotypes, there are derived multiple subtypes-referred to as topotypes-because they are designated by their geographical point of identification and sometimes year of detection. Regarding vaccination, there is limited cross-protection within a serotype and no practical cross-protection between the seven different serotypes (meaning a vaccine generated against an A serotype will not protect an animal from disease from an O serotype). This complicates vaccine planning because it is difficult for non-endemic countries to anticipate which topotypes from the seven serotypes to stock. This necessitates the development of large and robust vaccine banks.</p>
<p>The current FMD vaccine stockpile for the United States is managed by the North American Foot and Mouth Disease Vaccine Bank (NAFMDVB or Bank). The Bank is a trilateral partnership between the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and the Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries, and Food. The Chief Veterinary Officers of each country serve as the Bank's Commissioners, who oversee its executive administration. The countries work cooperatively to acquire and manage supplies of FMD vaccine, that are currently stored as a vaccine precursor referred to as vaccine antigen concentrate (VAC), from which the high-potency FMD vaccine is derived. The VAC is apportioned in accordance to the contribution level of each country; but at the time of an outbreak, the Commissioners can reallocate all or a portion of their country's vaccine share to the country(s) experiencing an outbreak within North America and at times, countries of other continents.</p>
<p>Historically, the United States has been aligned with a "stamping-out only" policy which included a "vaccinate to kill" option. Due to this policy, the Bank vaccine stocks had been predicated on a "vaccinate to kill" strategy as part of a greater eradication program. However given the considerable expansion of the livestock production sector since the inception of the policy, the United States determined that the country could not afford to pursue an exclusive "stamping-out only" strategy except in the most limited of outbreaks. In moderate to large-scale outbreaks, such severe actions would place an undue financial and manpower burden on State and Federal regulatory agencies in trying to contain the outbreak; depopulate animals and dispose of tons of carcasses; and could result in the collapse of the domestic animal commodities production sector. So in place of the "stamping-out only" policy, the United States has elected to pursue a "vaccinate to live" policy if the outbreak circumstances warrant this approach.</p>
<p>Requirement</p>
<p>To realign its strategy, the United States is seeking to increase its portion of FMD vaccine Bank holdings and acquire sufficient quantities of VAC or other long-term vaccine precursor storage form(s) to mount a "vaccinate to live" campaign in the United States. These holdings will initially be focused on inactivated products, but novel vaccine platforms or novel processes of generating inactivated vaccine will be considered, provided they meet the performance criteria detailed in this document. While this action would be a U.S.-only acquisition, it would be transacted within the context of the Bank whose other partners may elect to pursue a similar strategy in the future.</p>
<p>Commensurate with this goal, the United States is seeking information from FMD vaccine manufacturers who can meet the objectives and criteria in this document. These broadly include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Possess an extensive FMD virus master seed library to include both current and previously circulating topotypes; and/or, be able to generate a construct equivalent to a master seed (e.g., recombinant virus or genetically altered virus/vector); <br />&bull; Have sufficient resources to quickly generate a master seed (or equivalent construct) when a novel topotype is identified that has no or poor extant vaccine matching;<br />&bull; Manufacture products that have a reasonable expectation to be safe and effective in all target species (i.e., cattle, swine, sheep, and goats);<br />&bull; Supply and maintain high potency vaccine (&ge; 6 PD50 or the equivalent) in the form of VAC or other vaccine precursor storage form(s) in sufficient quantities necessary for a "vaccinate to live" campaign within the United States; and<br />&bull; Possess the capacity to meet U.S. FMD vaccine needs during a prolonged vaccination campaign after the VAC or other long-term storage form(s) is exhausted.</p>
<p>Vaccine Precursor</p>
<p>To meet the needs of a "vaccinate to live" campaign for susceptible U.S. livestock; the amount of vaccine precursor (e.g., VAC) or other long-term storage form(s) apportioned to the United States in the Bank will need to be significantly increased. Requirements are as follows:<br /><br />&bull; Build an inventory of emergency vaccine precursor that would encompass the top ten FMD topotypes posing the highest risk to North America as determined by the NAFMDVB and based on data from the OIE World Reference Laboratory for FMD, The Pirbright Institute; <br />&bull; The minimum amount of vaccine precursor required for such an effort would be approximately 25 million doses per high-risk topotype. As resources permit, this minimum amount should be increased for select high-risk topotypes; lower risk topotypes may be added to the Bank over time (but not necessarily in the same amounts as the high-risk topotypes); <br />&bull; It is important that manufacturers can acquire novel or emerging topotypes that are deemed as high-risk to North America, and be capable of developing a master seed virus or the equivalent in a timely manner so that the product derived from that topotype can be represented in the inventory. Such emerging topotypes would be in addition to the ten high-risk topotypes, and may encompass two to three additional topotypes added to the base high risk ten topotypes or to replace no longer relevant topotypes as needed;<br />&bull; Vaccine precursor would be maintained by the manufacturer for a period of not less than two years from the date of manufacture, and replaced on a predetermined rotational schedule while performing periodic quality assurance assessments to ensure sustained potency with results to be reported to the United States;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Vaccine precursors with prolonged shelf lives beyond two years would be given<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;favorable consideration in a future solicitation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Manufacturers providing rebates for replacement precursor would be given <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; favorable consideration in a future solicitation; and<br />&bull; The United States seeks to identify vaccine manufacturers who can produce vaccine precursor in these volumes on a reasonable schedule and maintain the vaccine precursor until it is needed.</p>
<p>Finished Vaccine<br /><br />&bull; All finished FMD vaccines must be supplied in the form of high-potency vaccine (&ge; 6 PD50 or an equivalent validated measure of potency);<br />&bull; All eligible FMD vaccines must be either licensed (fully or conditionally) or permitted by the USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) for distribution and sale within the United States; or authorized by the Administrator to be used under the supervision and control of the Department as described in the 9 CFR 106.1 with the condition the manufacturer is actively engaged in the pursuit of obtaining a USDA CVB product license (full or conditional) or permit;<br />&bull; All FMD vaccines to be considered must have a reasonable expectation to be safe and effective in all target species (i.e., cattle, swine, sheep, and goats); <br />&bull; All FMD vaccines must be efficacious when employing a standard vaccination schedule; specifically a priming dose, plus booster (if necessary), with an anticipated duration of protective immunity of &ge; six months; products providing duration of immunity of &gt; six months or convey sufficient immunity for at least six months with only one vaccine dose would be given favorable consideration in a future solicitation;<br />&bull; Acceptable FMD vaccine formulations would include but not limited to inactivated vaccine products; vectored vaccine products; DNA/RNA vaccine products; or any other novel vaccine platform, providing that said platform(s) meets all purity, safety, efficacy, and potency requirements as established by the CVB;<br />&bull; Vectored or nonviable/nonreplicating delivery systems may not be considered if they cannot be used solely in a prolonged vaccination campaign. Specifically, if the vector induces immunity against itself such that successive boostering with that product results in diminishing immunity, then such products may not be viewed favorably unless they provide extraordinary immunity (e.g., long duration, very rapid onset) or act synergistically with other products to provide extraordinary immunity;<br />&bull; The cost-benefit of any product(s) must be equivalent or superior to high-potency (&ge; 6 PD50 or the equivalent) inactivated FMD vaccine, unless that product(s) conveys extraordinary immunity such as rapid onset or unusually long duration of immunity; or the ability to rapidly alter the master seed to match the circulating field virus;<br />&bull; Any eligible FMD vaccine products must be DIVA (differentiate infected from vaccinated animal) compatible using a diagnostic test that is, or can be, validated by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories. This DIVA test must be capable of being conducted using conventional laboratory instruments that would be available in a modern veterinary diagnostic laboratory;<br />&bull; FMD vaccines capable of multivalent antigen formulation and delivery using a single common adjuvant (if necessary) would receive favorable consideration; specifically, USDA seeks to purchase those product lines where multiple topotypes can be combined into a single vaccine formulation with a compatible adjuvant where necessary; and<br />&bull; Vaccines that may be given by multiple delivery systems (e.g., needle-free devices) or by multiple routes of administration (e.g., intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally) would be given special consideration.</p>
<p>Pre-Outbreak Finished Vaccine Supplies</p>
<p>In the future, the United States may also stock an amount of finished vaccine derived from the high-risk topotypes for launching an immediate vaccination campaign. Therefore, the United States is seeking vaccine manufacturers who can produce and maintain a supply of finished high-potency vaccine with an extended shelf-life.</p>
<p>Requirements for Manufacturer</p>
<p>&bull; Eligible manufacturers should possess and maintain a comprehensive master seed virus collection (inactivated products) and demonstrate the capacity to efficiently isolate and produce a master seed virus; or develop and maintain a library of genomic constructs (vectored products);<br />&bull; All eligible manufacturers must be inspected by the CVB and have met the criteria for an Approved Manufacturing Facility;<br />&bull; Manufacturers who offer vaccines that exhibit epitopic dominance supported by experimental data (broad protection within serotype) will be given preference;<br />&bull; Favorable consideration would be given to those manufacturers who have the flexibility and manufacturing capacity to:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Dedicate manufacturing lines to United States vaccine production at the time of <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an outbreak;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Demonstrate sufficient surge capacity for the production of FMD vaccine&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commensurate with anticipated U.S.&nbsp;operational needs;<br />&bull; When responding to this request for information, manufacturers should indicate their current capacity and delivery schedule to supply the estimated amount of vaccine precursor and conventional finished vaccine listed here:<br /><br />*Precursor Estimate*<br />Number of Topotypes is 10<br />(For this calculation, use<br />the 10 most common topotypes<br />and with all serotypes<br />represented except SAT3.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Conventional Vaccine Estimate*<br /><br />Qty of Vaccine Precursor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doses/week (mono/equivalent)<br />1. 500 million (50m per type)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5 million/week<br />2. 350 million (35m per type)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 million/week<br />3. 250 million (25m per type)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 500,000/week<br />4. 150 million (15m per type)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 250,000/week</p>
<p>&bull; Manufacturers may also provide projected production capacities and delivery schedules if capital investments are aimed at improving such capacity within the next three to five years;<br />&bull; Should the vaccine precursor (e.g., VAC) be exhausted, the United States needs to ensure that an ongoing supply of conventional high-potency FMD vaccine (not produced from vaccine precursor) is available to continue the vaccination campaign:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o This supply of vaccine may range from 0.5 to 1 million doses of vaccine per week<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for an extended period. Therefore, the United States is seeking vaccine <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manufacturers who possess the surge capacity for conventional high-potency FMD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vaccine production to address the needs of an ongoing large-scale U.S. FMD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outbreak;<br />&bull; Favorable consideration would be given to those manufacturers who facilitate the transition from traditional inactivated products to superior vaccine platforms as they become available and are validated;<br />&bull; Manufacturers must have the physical facilities (including cryogenic storage, if required, and monitoring capacity) sufficient to maintain the amount of vaccine precursor that is anticipated to be needed by the United States (approximately 250-500 million doses); and<br />&bull; The manufacturer would supply samples of Master Cell Stocks, Master Seed Virus, Challenge Virus, VAC samples, pilot vaccines (e.g., small serials of finished vaccine that are used to demonstrate efficacy and stability of the VAC) and antisera upon request for independent quality assurance assessment and further testing by USDA laboratories.</p>
<p>If your organization has the potential capacity to meet this future requirement, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address, telephone number, business size as determined by the NAICS code, type of ownership for the organization; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is voluntary. The government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.<br /><br />Based on responses to this sources-sought notice, this requirement may be set aside for small business or procured through unrestricted competition. No feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.</p>

<DESC>Title: Influenza-free Ferret Supply for Improving Public Health<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice for market survey to be used for preliminary planning purposes. This request is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.<br />Background. The Influenza Division at CDC requires access to healthy ferrets that are serologically negative against all influenza virus strains. These animals are needed for i) the production of strain-specific immune sera for use as a diagnostic reagent and to monitor antigenic drift of circulating influenza viruses which is necessary to assist with influenza vaccine composition recommendations ii) the safety and efficacy testing of vaccine candidates against influenza viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic and iii) the evaluation of the virulence, transmissibility and antiviral resistance of emerging influenza viruses that pose a threat to public health. Pursuing these critical missions of the Influenza Division is dependent on a constant and reliable supply of influenza-free ferrets. <br />Project Objective - The purpose of this contract is to secure a stable supply of healthy ferrets that are sero-negative against influenza A and B viruses so that the Influenza Division at CDC can provide accurate and reliable assessments of influenza surveillance, safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates and risk assessments of emerging influenza viruses that pose a threat to public health. <br />Scope of Work - The contractor will provide the CDC with a monthly inventory of ferrets available for purchase. This inventory must include at least 50 healthy, male ferrets that are 3-6 months of age and are sero-negative against influenza A and B viruses. The contractor will provide up to 120 ferret pre-bleeds per month selected by the CDC based on the provided inventory list. Sera will be tested by the CDC to confirm sero-negativity. The contractor will deliver up to 120 ferrets per month in a single delivery each month based on the testing results and projected needs of the CDC. All ferrets will be transported in sealed, HEPA-filtered containers and in a climate controlled environment.<br />Technical Requirements: <br />Ferret Inventory Maintenance: <br />All CDC-bound ferrets at the contractor's facility will be maintained inside of a HEPA-filtered enclosure. All staff entering the enclosure will wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including respirator to protect the animals from potential exposure to influenza virus. Any staff experiencing influenza-like illness will not enter the ferret housing enclosure. An up to date inventory account of available ferrets will be provided to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) at the CDC via email by the 5th day of each month and will include the dates of birth for each lot of animals. The ferret inventory will be maintained so that at least 50 healthy, male ferrets that are sero-negative to influenza A and B viruses will be available on any given month. The age of these ferrets will be restricted to 3-6 months at the time of inventory assessment. Each month the CDC will select up to 120 ferrets from the inventory to screen for potential purchase; the COR will communicate this selection to the contractor in an email.
<p>Delivery of Ferret Prebleeds:<br />The contractor will collect blood samples from each of the selected ferrets and will isolate approximately 0.2-0.5 mL of serum from each sample. This will be accomplished by centrifugation of whole blood and transfer of the separated top layer of serum to a fresh, sterile vial that is labeled with the corresponding ferret ear tag number. Within 3 business days of the CDC's request for prebleeds, the contractor will ship the frozen serum samples via overnight delivery to the CDC so that they arrive on a non-holiday, business day. The contractor will also email the COR a list of the prebleeds (itemized by ferret ID) with each ferret's date of birth included. The sera will be tested for the presence of influenza antibody by the CDC and, based on the results, the COR will communicate via email which ferrets should be delivered to the CDC.<br />Delivery of Ferrets: <br />Up to 12 deliveries per year (1 per month) will be scheduled between the contractor and the COR at the CDC. Each delivery will be scheduled within two weeks of the COR's communication of screening results to the contractor. All ferrets will be housed in sealed, HEPA-filtered animal transport containers and transportation will occur in a climate-controlled environment. Transport containers will be positioned so that ample airflow is maintained during transport. Ferrets are extremely sensitive to elevated temperatures. Anyone loading or unloading the ferrets should wear personal protective equipment including a respirator to protect the animals from potential exposure to influenza during transport to the CDC. If ferrets are transported via ground, a back-up vehicle will be available in case the primary transport vehicle malfunctions. <br />Replacement Ferrets:<br />Any ferrets that die in transit will be replaced by the contractor at no cost to the CDC. Any ferret identified as sero-positive after being tested upon arrival at the CDC will be replaced by the contractor at no cost to the CDC.<br />Anticipated period of performance. The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months base year with four (4) option years, twelve (12) months each. <br />Capability statement /information sought.

NRC uses this contract for its Architecture and Engineering (A&amp;E) requirements for small and large scale construction projects at NRC Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. A significant, but previously unanticipated, large scale space renovation and construction project known as the White Flint Consolidation Project emerged and is now underway in order to conform to the new GSA federal space standard mandate. The project requires the unanticipated space renovation and construction of two additional floors of the One White Flint North building. This work is necessary in order for the NRC to relocate some of its staff so that the space they currently occupy can be released for occupancy by another federal agency. The ceiling price on the contract has nearly been exhausted due in part to this unanticipated mandate. The NRC needs to increase the ceiling price on the contract to ensure sufficient ceiling price and scope to handle immediate A&amp;E requirements for approved, funded, and scheduled construction projects related to the GSA space mandate until a new acquisition can be competed in the coming months to replace the contract. The unanticipated A&amp;E services required for two additional floors will include: conducting engineer led field surveys, graphical surveys, analysis of existing work space and planned work space, preparing engineering studies, creating reports of recommended actions and /or design packages, developing program of requirements, cost estimates, test fits, space plans, design intent drawings (DIDs), construction documents (CD's), and project management.<br /><br />At the current contract utilization rate, the contract is estimated to exhaust its current ceiling price on or about March 31, 2016. NRC expects that it will take three or more months to complete the follow-on competitive acquisition and begin full use of the replacement contract. Therefore, without an appropriate increase in ceiling price to the contract that would accommodate NRC's previously unanticipated needs for that period of time, it would cause significant disruption to NRC's ability to address GSA's new space utilization rate mandate that requires federal government agencies to reduce their space footprint and standards it would also delay NRC's ability to relocate some of its staff so that the space they currently occupy can be released for occupancy by another federal agency.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, intends to negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for VMware Horizon Maintenance Renewal in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 15.2, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. The contract will be awarded to OARnet. Market research was previously conducted and it has been determined that this is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide the required supplies/services within three (3) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted with only one respondent able to meet the government's needs due to the information being proprietary: OARnet. Lt Col Kenneth Decker, Jr., AFLCMC/AQ, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 45433, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Existence of the Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer. Accordingly, the Ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process and, therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the buyer at the telephone number listed herein. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Specialist, McKenna Maertens at (937) 255-3374 or e-mail: mckenna.maertens@us.af.mil Should you desire to contact the Ombudsman, Lt Col Kenneth Decker, Jr. can be reached at (937) 255-5512, e-mail: kenneth.decker.1@us.af.mil.</p>

<CONTACT>Kemper Nichole Wood, Email kemper.wood@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, sole source, fixed price contract with SRI International, 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA 94025-3453 for the purpose of procuring a maintenance service and to augment the Fanuc Improvised Explosive Device Disassembly Robot.
<p>The FBI has a requirement for one-year support and maintenance for the two Taurus Robot Systems, to include all required software updates as well as required hardware repair or maintenance. The FBI also has a requirement to augment the Fanuc Improvised Explosive Device Disassembly Robot ("the Fanuc"). The Fanuc is an industrial robot adapted to use a variety of custom tools to allow for the remote disassembly of live IED's. It resides in the downrange facility and is controlled remotely from up range. The FBI requires the development of the capability for the Taurus Robot's 3D vision and dual manipulators to be utilized by the Fanuc. More specifically, the FBI requires engineering and design for the capability for the manipulator to be attached and detached from the Fanuc's tool changer interface. When not attached to the Fanuc, the manipulator requires special storage. Therefore, the FBI also requires engineering of this solution. Finally, the FBI requires their two existing Taurus Robots to be upgraded with the above capability and, thereby, functionality.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that SRI International is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Taurus Robot System; therefore, they are the only company capable of providing the necessary engineering, design and upgrades to the two Taurus Robots as well as the support and maintenance.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)</p>
<p>The FBI intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of: <strong>Kemper Wood, email address: Kemper.Wood@ic.fbi.gov by Monday, March 21, 2016 (8:00 am Eastern).</strong> Emailed responses will only be considered. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<DESC>The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Region 5, intends to award a firm-fixed price, sole source contract to Lotek Wireless Inc, 115 Pony Drive, Newmarket, Ontario, Canada for the purchase of digitally coded radio telemetry equipment.  

FWS is conducting a multi-year study to track the movements of high priority bird species within offshore areas.  The high-range radio antenna receiving stations and transmitters already in place uses a proprietary coded algorithm that allows the potential for continuous data collection unlike traditional telemetry systems that must scan for and change frequencies resulting in discontinuous data collection.  Using the same equipment is essential for maintaining continuity of data collection and analysis for this multi-year study.

The NAICS code is 334290, Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing, with a size standard of 750 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes; however, all responsible sources shall be considered for future requirements. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

All responses and questions should be directed to Ryna Russell via email at ryna_russell@fws.gov.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>Veterans Affairs Network Contracting Office 6 (NCO 6) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with PRO-AIM Americas, LLC (DUNS:  962568338), pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.5, specifically FAR 13.501(a)(1), and Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  The proposed sole source purchase order is for four (4) ERBE VIO 300D Electrosurgical Units, four (4) APC2 coagulators and related parts.  Delivery will be made to the Kernersville Health Care Center, in North Carolina.

The action will result in the purchase of four (4) ERBE VIO 3000D electrosurgical units, four (4) APC2 argon plasma coagulators and related parts, for delivery to Kernersville Health Care Center in Kernersville, North Carolina.  A new firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded.  The independent government estimate is $167,089.72.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2.

The sole source procurement is being conducted on the basis of (1) standardization with existing equipment used at the Salisbury VA Medical Center and satellite medical facilities.  The equipment is familiar to medical staff and changing brands would unnecessarily increase the risk of patient injury, as medical personnel rotate between facilities.  (2) Use of another brand is prohibitive due to concerns related to training.  The medical staff is trained on the ERBE brand of electrosurgical/APC equipment and must have their competency affirmed on a periodic basis.  Using another brand of equipment will cause the facility to revise its training program and to re-establish competency for all users on multiple devices, in different locations.  No competing device is so advantageous as to warrant changing brands and causing the facility to conduct multiple, repetitive training actions to support one device.  Standardization for the purpose of ensuring patient safety was supported under GAO ruling B-407223.2.  Standardization is further supported in the attached peer-reviewed journal article, "Evaluating and Predicting Patient Safety for Medical Devices with Integral Information Technology."

Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805, the Management and Operating Contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).&nbsp;&nbsp;BEA is seeking parties interested in potentially entering into a license agreement for the purpose of commercializing the technology described below.&nbsp;&nbsp;BEA does not make any representations, provide any warranties, or otherwise endorse or guarantee the suitability of this patent to a licensee's specific needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #222222; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">INVENTION SUMMARY:<br /></span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 9pt;">High temperature molten salt based electrolytes can provide a cost-effective technological solution to the manufacture of aluminum-coated metallic substrates for a variety of engineering applications, particularly in corrosive/marine environments. BEA has developed methods and systems for applying metallic coatings with a quaternary bromide containing electroplating bath and an aluminum anode primarily to develop corrosive tolerant compositions. The process may also be used in a broad range of applications providing high quality aluminum coatings on both ferrous and non-ferrous metals and divergent surfaces and geometries.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> Currently, chloride based plating baths are being used to electroplate aluminum on steel, brass, copper and other substrate materials but have multiple drawbacks including the lack of ability to form a diffused aluminum layer between the substrate metal surface and aluminum coating due to the relatively low plating temperature. In addition traditional approaches do not prevent the loss of functional electrolyte thereby often producing non-ideal downstream product characteristics. <br /> <br /> The novel BEA quaternary alkali bromide electrolyte plating system produces superior quality aluminum plated metallic surfaces, with better corrosion mitigation properties due to the formation of a diffused aluminum layer in between the metal surface and the aluminum coating. Also, the bromide plating bath can efficiently prevent the loss of the functional electrolyte that results in the formation of controlled product characteristics such as: smoothness, thickness, and adhesion of coatings on various metallic substrates.<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"><br /> </span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background: yellow;"><br /> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">This invention has associated intellectual property filing Patent Application No.&nbsp;&nbsp;62/193,376, "Methods and Systems for Aluminum Electroplating" which was submitted to the USPTO by BEA on July 16, 2015 and currently unpublished.</span></p>

<DESC>The Office of Acquisition and Agreements Management (OAAM), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the Material Measurement Laboratory (MML), Chemical Sciences Division (CSD), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Leonard Industries Robotics Engineering and Design, of Alexandria, VA, for a modification to an existing contract.
<p>In September of 2014, NIST/AMD competitively awarded contract number SB1341-14-SE-0401 to Leonard Industrial Robotics Engineering and Design (LIRED) to implement computer codes to provide the necessary computational infrastructure to generate efficient data analytics tools for the integrated processing of mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data for metabolomics and petroleomics as applied to health and environment.</p>
<p>The contract was for a one-year base period with one one-year option period. Work under the base period addressed metabolomics. Work under the option period addressed petroleomics. Option period I was exercised in September of 2015.</p>
<p>The contract required the government to supply the contractor with a sufficiently large and robust collection of quality metabolomics and petroleomics data to develop and test the new analytic tools and to serve as the body of data to be analyzed. NIST has been unable to establish sufficient connections to internal and external sources of quality petroleomics data to meet this requirement. Thus, the government determined, after the option period had been exercised, that it could not complete its obligations with respect to the development of petroleomics tools and analysis with LIRED as required for the option period.</p>
<p>Concurrently, the government's mission priorities and objectives determined that lipidomics would be the direction of wisest progression in the development of integrated measurements and data across multiple "omics" disciplines based on available data, tractability and relevance. The analysis algorithm and workflow established by LIRED for metabolomics was determined to be the basis upon which to build the same analysis capability in lipidomics. This approach is consistent with the Government's project timelines for inter-laboratory comparisons of lipidomics using developed tools.</p>
<p>The Government intends to modify the scope of the contract to change the requirement such that LIRED shall generate efficient data analytic tools for the integrated of mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data for lipidomics, in lieu of petroleomics. It is required that LIRED complete the required work for lipidomics. This determination is based upon the following:</p>
<p>The MML/CSD is presently launching an FY16 inter-laboratory comparison of candidate materials with national and international stakeholders in metabolomics and lipidomics. The development of appropriate and consistent data analytics tools and associated metrics is critical to the quality assessment of inter-laboratory data that will distinguish among different samples, processing conditions and laboratories. Community access to these Reference Materials and Data (RMDs) and the developed data analytics tools are critical to provide convergence of the capability needed for measurement harmonization of the emerging fields of metabolomics and lipidomics.</p>
<p>NIST's need to develop unique data analytics tools for the analysis of raw and processed spectral lipidomics data, and to support the processing and analysis of this data using the developed tools is required to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2016. The contractor must provide both scientific software development and experienced data processing and analysis of MS and NMR data. The contract requires the development of specialized data analysis tools within 60 days of contract award. Processing and analysis of MS and NMR data, plus refinements to data analysis tools and workflow, are required throughout the contract period. The resulting computational infrastructure must be compatible with existing metabolomics data analysis algorithms and workflows to facilitate a comprehensive suite of Reference Materials and Data across these two areas of research.</p>
<p>In addition to the work conducted with LIRED on metabolomics in FY15, CSD has already invested the full time efforts of a guest researcher and 1.5 full-time employees into developing complementary data analytics tools for the analysis of raw and processed spectral metabolomics and lipidomics inter-laboratory comparison data. The government's ultimate RMD will consist of multiple data analysis tools and workflows derived from internal and external sources, with the tools and analysis being but a part of the whole. LIRED developed data analysis tools and workflows for metabolomics is the first of this intended suite of "omics" analysis tools. The success of the metabolomics effort is the result of one year of effort. The majority of the software development was at the beginning of the contract period, and experienced processing and analysis of NMR and MS data along with workflow refinements were provided throughout the contract period.</p>
<p>The same methodology must be utilized for the development of lipidomics data analytic tools so that the resulting RMD suites share a common basis across multiple "omics". While NIST maintains data rights under the contract, the requirement for the resulting RMD suites to share a common basis across multiple "omics" extends beyond providing another Contractor with deliverables produced under the existing contract.</p>
<p>The primary beneficiaries of these RMDs in the biochemistry community are clinical researchers, healthcare diagnostic test providers, industry, and federal laboratories that assist public health (NIH, CDC, FDA). <br />Consistent methodologies reduce training and familiarization barriers to acceptance and application in the different areas of research, promoting the wide use of reliable modeling tools that integrate measurements and quality data to advance both knowledge and technology.</p>
<p>Differing methodologies must be vetted by the government for quality of the scientific information generated from the corresponding data analysis at the cost of months of effort with an uncertain end. A fragmented analysis suite would seriously limit the impact of the project due to the required additional burdens on the intended customer of training and familiarization when different datasets are involved. These burdens directly conflict with the requirement to develop a common, consistent set of tools and data that enables this community to ultimately perform true and reproducible "omics" measurements.</p>
<p>Considering the requirement for data analytics tools to be completed in Fiscal Year 2016, the need to maintain a common and consistent set of tools and data to provide to the user community, and based upon the information herein, incorporating a change from petroleomics to lipidomics into the contract with LIRED, represents the most advantageous method of fulfilling the Government's needs.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by March 24, 2016, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to proceed with the proposed modification, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to re-compete this requirement.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competition a sequel instrument from the vendor Pacific Biosciences.  Sequel System including Instrument, Primary Analysis compute, Sequel Software (Instrument Control, Signal Processing, Base Calling, Quality Assessment, Alignment, Assembly, Visualization) and Installation Kit. Includes 12-month comprehensive warranty subject to Pacific Biosciences. On-site instruction of up to three (3) participants at the customer's location by a Pacific Biosciences Field Applications Specialist (FAS). Includes training kit and FAS travel-related expenses. Training includes Assay, Software and Bioinformatics. The Sequel System is designed to scale and increase as well as decrease overall system input. This was accomplished by improvements in instrument function, chemistry, polymerase, and software.  The Sequel has the capability to scale throughput by adjusting the density of the ZWMs on the SMRT cell. As a result the average read length is expected to increase from 8,000-12,000 bp to lengths of &gt;15,000bp. Also, the sequencing time per SMRT cell is adjustable per application need and ranges from 30 minutes to 6 hours. Also, there is no other instrument that meets the standards of the Sequel and there is no other vendor that can provide the Sequel System and its associated library prep polymerase and sequencing reagents.  This system sequences individual DNA molecules using a proprietary sequence-by-synthesis approach.  It exclusively processes SMRT Cells and reagents creating a scalable platform for sequencing and it is covered by numerous patents owned by PacBio, thus making this system unique to this particular vendor. Two such innovations are the ZMW technology that enables the isolation and real-time detection of fluorescently labeled bases incorporated at the single molecule level and the phospholinked nucleotides that produce a completely natural DNA strand. Other unique features of the Sequel include the circularized sequencing templates that allow for multiple sequence reads of a single molecule, the software pipelines that are developed specifically for analyzing long-read data, and the high quality assembly of GC high or low regions, including repeats. This is not a request for proposal. All responsible sources who are certified by Pacific Biosciences as authorized third party  vendors may submit a proposal. All responsible sources may submit a response that will be considered.  This will be a firm fixed price contract in accordance with the statutory authority for this sole source requirement 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible.

<SUBJECT>Extension: EP-D-11-060 Technical Support - ReVA
<SOLNBR>RFQ-RT-16-00043
<CONTACT>Pinney, Heather
<DESC>Intent to Sole Source:
NAICS Code: 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of technical support services under the current contract, EP-D-11-060, as described below.  EP-D-11-060 expires on March 31, 2016.  The Government requires completion of tasks and delivery of deliverables as defined in EP-D-11-060, Option Period IV, Work Assignment (WA) 036, entitled Sustainable and Healthy Communities Research Program (SHCRP) Existing and New Tools, which at this time, cannot be completed by the stated expiration date of the contract.  The services under this work assignment are critical and need to be completed.  The EPA intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Oneida Total Integrated Enterprises, LLC (OTIE), 1033 N. Mayfair Rd Ste 200, Milwaukee, WI 53226, a modification to contract EP-D-11-060 to incorporate and exercise FAR clause 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services to extend services under this contract for one additional month of service to complete the work assignment, with the option to extend to, but not to exceed a total of six months of additional service, until such time that the tasks stated in the referenced work assignment are completed and deliverables have been received and accepted by the EPA.  

OTIE currently provides the stated technical support services for ReVA (development and refinement of statistical methods, analyses, and quantitative models; ongoing design, development, and enhancement of web- and PC-based assessment and visualization tools to provide accessibility to research results; literature review support; mining, compilation, and management of data an information and accessibility to data and models used in these assessments; exploration and development of new information technologies; development of risk-reduction, economic, and quality of life benefit-cost analyses to support comparison of alternative futures and trading options; outreach and technology transfer activities; development, packaging, and distribution of products; and support for workshops on methods, expert opinions, and review of products including logistics and facilitation) for the EPAs Office of Research and Development (ORD) located at 109 TW Alexander Dr, Research Triangle Park, NC, under contract EP-D-11-060, and has provided these services under said contract since April 2011.  OTIE has been working diligently on completing WA 036 since May 2015 and has made significant progress.  The EPAs technical representative is confident that OTIE will be able to complete the work assignment, to include the delivery of deliverables, given additional time.  The continuity that OTIEs technical support services will provide are critical to ORDs ReVA priorities and to ensure continuity of research.

There are no other entities that have the capability of providing the level, breadth, and depth of technical support that are required by ORDs ReVA in order to prevent the loss of critical research data and maintain full continuity of research, as it pertains to the referenced work assignment, with the least amount of disruption to in the short period of time required to complete this work assignment on a temporary basis.   

OTIE is best suited for continuing to provide the above indicated technical support services under this contract to complete the work assignment for the requested extension as they have the necessary infrastructure, personnel, supplies, and subcontractors already in place, fully functioning, and doing so will guarantee continuity of technical support services for ORD ReVA and provide for the completion of the referenced work assignment and delivery of stated deliverables.  

The Government is not stating that there are no other contractors who can provide this level of technical support for the ReVA requirement.  The Government understands that there are other companies that provide similar technical support services.  The Government is instead saying that considering the short period of performance contemplated within this extension and that the work assignment was issued to, is currently being worked by OTIE, and is near completion, no other contractors could transition this workload from OTIE and efficiently continue performance without potential reduced services, increased costs, increased time for completion, and unnecessary risks to the Government.  This one month extension, with the option to extend to, but not to exceed a total of six months of additional services is not an attempt by the Government to limit competition to the incumbent contractor, but to provide additional time to complete the tasks and provide deliverables as defined in the work assignment.

In accordance with FAR Part 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Agency.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the direction of the Government.  

This notice will be posted for 15 days.  

The intent of this synopsis is to state the Governments intention to sole source this requirement and to determine if any other source(s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required service should 1) fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing and submit same via FedConnect, a government web portal, within 15 days from the date of this announcement; and 2) must submit itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  

Consequently, any responder(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Offerors must submit all technical questions / responses concerning this synopsis electronically through FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/Fedconnect/.  This notice and any amendments will be available via the Internet at the following URL:  www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/ .  You must register with FedConnect as an interested party to submit questions and to view responses.  Vendors can register with FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/. For assistance in registering or for other FedConnect technical questions please call the FedConnect Help Desk at (800) 899-6665 or email at support@fedconnect.net. FedConnect is a web portal that connects agencies and vendors to streamline the process of doing business with the federal government. Through FedConnect contractors will be able to receive, review and respond to contract pre- and post-award actions and documents such as correspondence, request for proposals, tasking instruments and contract modifications. The use of FedConnect also furthers the EPAs commitment to moving towards a paperless acquisition environment by reducing its carbon footprint and conducting its business in an ecologically friendly manner.  There is no charge to use FedConnect. In addition, all vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), as this facilitates registration for FedConnect.

<SUBJECT>66--Nikon NiE Motorized Microscope Body & Xenon Light
<SOLNBR>RFQ-RT-16-00044
<CONTACT>Ancharski, Judy
<DESC>Nikon NiE Motorized Upright Microscope Body +300 Watt Xenon Light Source
Notice of Intent
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Nikon Instruments, Incorporated for the purchase of a new NiE Microscope Body and 300 Watt Xenon Light source for the existing Nikon E-800 research microscope that is currently being used in the EPAs National Health & Environmental  Effects Research (NHEERL) Laboratory. This procurement for the Nikon E-800 microscope is recommended to be processed without full and open competition. The circumstances permitting other than full and open competition at this time is FAR 13.501(a), sole source.  
The Nikon E-800 research microscope that is currently being used in NHEERLs laboratory to study nanoparticles has a number of limitations which impedes research efforts. The body of the microscope being replaced will correct these problems and deficiencies. The replacement equipment will be compatible with the objectives cameras, light source, and stage.  Since NHEERL is currently using objectives and parts from the existing Nikon microscope, which are not exchangeable with another brand of microscope, the equipment must be bought from Nikon Instruments.   The NiE Nikon body must be compatible with the current E-800 microscope parts which include the following: objectives, xenon light source Prior automatic stage and Lightform PARISS microspectrophometer equipment, Sola fluorescent light source and Nikon Elements.
Nikon Instruments will be responsible for setting up the new microscope parts and equipment onto the new NiE microscope body that is currently located at the EPA-RTP.  Nikon must insure that all new components are properly integrated with the current E-800 components, work properly together so there is spectral registration & field illumination, and increased power and efficiency in the optical system.  
Therefore, EPA believes Nikon Instrument, Inc. is the only vendor capable of providing the above referenced microscope body and parts designed to be used with the existing Nikon E-800 research microscope currently located at the EPA NHEERL laboratory.  The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available.  Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored.  The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please submit response to Judy Ancharski at Ancharski.judy@epa.gov or to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Judy Ancharski (AA-005), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 109 Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.  No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

<RESPDATE>033016
<CONTACT>Ashley M. Farrier, Contracting Officer, Phone 8138260483, Email ashley.farrier@socom.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to notify industry that the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for proposal or quotation.</p>
<p>USSOCOM has a requirement for All Source Information Fusion (ASIF) with advanced analytics capabilities in support of intelligence analysis and production. The command recently awarded competitive contracts to integrate new commercial off the shelf software ASIF solutions with the existing Distributed Common Ground/Surface System - Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF) system architecture to meet the requirement. Until full operating capacity of the new solution is achieved in FY2020, the government has a need to bridge ASIF requirements with a sole source contract for the legacy software solution, Palantir.</p>
<p>Palantir software has been utilized by USSOCOM and its components since 2009. The software meets legacy requirements for ASIF and supports operations and analysis for deployed units in the current areas of operation. It has been tested and certified for use on the SOF information technology enterprise. Use of any other product would require substantial integration and testing in addition to training and fielding to operational units.</p>
<p>Award of a bridge contract to any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost and long delay to the government that is not expected to be recovered through additional competition. Palantir is the only known source for maintenance of Palantir software. Therefore, USSOCOM intends to issue a sole source award to Palantir Technologies, Inc with a base year and four 1-year option periods.</p>
<p>The estimated value of the bridge contract is $300M.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all responses received by 4:00 PM Eastern Time on 30 March 2016 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Correspondence in response to this notice shall be submitted to ashley.farrier@socom.mil and be identified with H92222-16-R-ASIF in the subject line.</p>

Clause Title: CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (DIAPR) 2010-14, Amendment 1

CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (JULY 2010)
(a) FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation. One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15. 
(b) The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS. CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report. Once the report is processed, it is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past performance as part of a source selection action.
(c) We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer with the name, position title, phone number, and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s) for the contract no later than 30 days after award. Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the Contractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before returning the report to the Assessing Official. The report information must be protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.
(d) When your Contractor Representative(s) (Past Performance Points of Contact) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically-generated email with detailed login instructions. Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS is available at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. The CPARS User Manual, registration for On Line Training for Contractor Representatives, and a practice application may be found at this site.
(e) Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the Contracting Officer will complete an interim or final past performance evaluation, and the report will be accessible at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the evaluation without comment. Comments are limited to the space provided in Block 22. Your comments should focus on objective facts in the Assessing Official's narrative and should provide your views on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance. In addition to the ratings and supporting narratives, blocks 1 - 17 should be reviewed for accuracy, as these include key fields that will be used by the Government to identify your firm in future source selection actions. If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating "No comment" in Block 22, and then signing and dating Block 23 of the form. Without a statement in Block 22, you will be unable to sign and submit the evaluation back to the Government. If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 30 days, it will automatically be returned to the Government and will be annotated: "The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date). The contractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment." Your response is due within 30 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR.
(f) The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:
(1) Protect the evaluation as "source selection information." After review, transmit the evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS. If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contact the Contracting Officer for instructions. 
(2) Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization. Ensure the evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of your control.
(3) Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, preaward surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.
(g) If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than seven days following your receipt of the evaluation. The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or other means during your 30-day review period.
(h) A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.
(End of notice)

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION: 
In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Bureau of Indian Education Programs (BIE), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Bureau of the Indian Education Programs (BIE), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, BIE or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation. Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, BIE Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

The small business size standard is $15.0M. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses. Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized.<br /><br /><strong><em>Background Information<br /></em></strong><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Laboratory's (ITL) Information Access Division's Retrieval Group works with industry, academia, and other government agencies to promote the use of more effective and efficient techniques for manipulating information not specifically structured for automatic use--especially the browsing, searching, and presentation of that information. Accurate evaluation of the capabilities of current information access systems is a prerequisite to improving the systems' capabilities. Human-created annotations are essential to the evaluation of information systems. Over the years, these evaluations have helped dramatically improve the overall state-of-the-art in information retrieval systems.<br /><br />The work of the Retrieval Group includes the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC). One of the main goals of TREC is to promote research in information retrieval (IR) by providing appropriate test collections.<br /><br />IR test collections consist of three parts: a set of documents, a set of information needs called "topics" that can be answered by some of the documents in the document set, and a set of relevance assessments that lists for each topic the set of documents that are relevant to that topic. The goal of the TREC Total Recall track is to investigate methods that allow users to find (essentially) all of the documents that are relevant to a request efficiently.<br /><br />NIST requires Contractor support services to modify and improve existing search engines as well as develop new state of the art search engines.<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference attachments for complete combined synopsis/solicitation.</span></em></strong>

<p>Our department performs numerous High Throughput Assays annually. The key step of any high throughput assay is the addition of reagents into a micro-well plate. The Tox21 Robotic Screening system relies on this equipment because of its flexibility and reliability of liquid dispensing within our laboratories. Tox21 is an effort to use the quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) approach to profile a collection of 10,000 compounds composed of environmental chemicals and drugs approved for human and animal use against a battery of cellular and biochemical assays for their potential to perturb biological pathways that may result in toxicity. Such a data set could be used to create a systematic view of the biological network and the interactions therein via its response to chemical perturbations. To achieve this goal, a set of assays needs to be selected or designed to measure targets that encompass all pathways that are relevant to toxicity.</p>

<p>This is a Total Small Business Set-Aside</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The purpose of the NIH Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease program (TRND) is to develop new candidate drugs for individuals with rare and neglected diseases. TRND activities will build upon the NIH Roadmap to accomplish its goals including the successes of NCATS. Our group facilitates drug discovery from the basic research lab to the pre-clinical stage. Picking up where our Probe Development Group work leaves off, TRND will concentrate its efforts on the pre-clinical stage of drug development, where researchers develop clinical candidate in preparation for human testing. In doing so, TRND will help bridge the wide gaps in time and resources that often exist between basic research and clinical testing of new drugs. It is expected that in most cases, TRND's clinical candidates will be licensed to biopharmaceutical companies for further development, thus allowing TRND to focus on the scientifically challenging pre-clinical stages of the drug development, and "de-risking" the projects sufficiently to make them adoptable by private sector companies. The NCATS Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) will handle oversight and governance of TRND. Researchers are now performing TRND's laboratory work in our newly renovated facility within our 9800 facility.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.27 per hour or $170.80 per week or $740.13 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, 4 weeks after 15 years, and 5 weeks after 20 years.<br />Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present<br />contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in<br />the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as<br />screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,<br />and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,<br />modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive<br />ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading<br />and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;<br />minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All<br />operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF-1444) **</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor<br />prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final<br />determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which<br />shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day<br />of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure<br />to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested<br />parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the<br />date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act<br />and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are<br />included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S.<br />Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy<br />of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See<br />29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties<br />requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage<br />determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).</p>

<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>

<p>AAPDs and CIBs contain changes to USAID policy and General Provisions in USAID regulations and contracts.  Please refer to http://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/aapds-cibs#psc to determine which AAPDs and CIBs apply to this contract.</p>
<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Jennifer Pacheco Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-4586 Email: jennifer.l.pacheco19.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 238220 with the related size standard of $ 15 Mil_ dollars. The Offeror shall be actively registered with that NAICS or a similar NAICS with the appropriate size standard prior to Award to be considered for any resulting contract. Failure to be properly registered under the appropriate size standard during evaluation and/or at the time of award deems the offer ineligible for award. A similar NAICS Code with the appropriate size standard other than the NAICS Code identified in this buy term may be used as a factor to determine technical capability. (Size standards do not apply to unrestricted set-aside solicitation/RFQ). <BR> <BR>

Evaluation of Quotes and Basis of Award

     (a) The Government will award a purchase order for commercial items resulting from this synopsis-solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote, conforming to this solicitation, is evaluated to be the lowest priced technically acceptable (LPTA).
  The ratings for the technical factors shall be Acceptable or Unacceptable.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes.  Technical Acceptability and Past Performance are the technical factors.

   	Factor 1 - Technical Acceptability (meets solicitation requirements)
Factor 2 - Past Performance (no less than Satisfactory/Acceptable performance ratings)

AND

Factor 3  Price (total evaluated price.  The basis for the total evaluated price is the total of all CLINs)

	(b) Submission Requirements and Evaluation:   

Factor 1 This acquisition is based on brand name items, therefore, technical acceptability will be evaluated on whether the specified brand name and part numbers for each item were quoted.
 Quotes based on items other than as specified will be evaluated Unacceptable. 
  
Factor 2  Do not submit past performance information.  The Government will access the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) to obtain past performance information on your firm, utilizing the DUNS number obtained from the Systems for Award Management (SAM) website.  If no past performance information is available, Factor 2 will be evaluated Unknown, which is considered Acceptable. If your firm has less than Satisfactory performance evaluations in PPIRS, you may submit acceptable explanations for the ratings for the Governments consideration. Acceptable explanations will result in an Acceptable rating for Past Performance.
     

In order to be evaluated overall Acceptable, a rating of Acceptable shall be obtained for both Factors 1 and 2.  If either one or both are rated Unacceptable, the entire technical quote will be rated Unacceptable and will be removed from further consideration for award.

	(c) The Government will evaluate all prices by listing the total of all CLINS (total evaluated price) from the lowest to the highest.  The Government will take the five lowest quotes received and evaluate the corresponding technical factors for acceptability.  Should the Government identify one quote that represents the lowest priced technically acceptable quote, the Government will make an award as long as the total evaluated price can be determined fair and reasonable.
  Should there be no technically acceptable quote among the first five lowest quotes, the Government will add the next lowest quote and will evaluate the corresponding technical factors for acceptability.  The Government will continue this methodology of evaluation until a quote is evaluated to be the lowest priced technically acceptable quote. 

	(d) Award will only be made to a firm that is determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR
Part 9.

<DESC><p>1. UPDATE: 14 March 2016. The purpose of this announcement is to post REVISED DRAFT requirements documents for the Army TADSS Maintenance Program (ATMP), provide the ATMP requirements changes due to the funding reductions and provide an updated target acquisition timeline. The ATMP Changes Worksheet provides a listing of all ATMP Announcements to date and their respective attachments. Be advised, ATMP has not entered PALT, but anticipates entering PALT in mid-late March 2016.</p>
<p>2. The attached Table of Contents provides a listing of all DRAFT documents and the Requirements Re-baseline Spreadsheet resulting from funding reductions. These documents can be found by selecting the Packages tab (in a .zip file) at the top of this FedBizOPPs announcement.</p>
<p>3. Recent funding reductions have resulted in a reduced scope for the ATMP acquisition. The changes resulting from the reduced scope are reflected in Appendix B in the form of Contractor Performance Factors (CPF) changes (e.g. CPF X changed to CPF Y for TADSS X) Additionally, Appendix B includes reductions of quantities of TADSS maintained.</p>
<p>4. Due to the changes resulting from the Requirements Re-baseline (funding reductions), the IPT delayed release of the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP). The current PM target dates are provided below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Draft RFP - 2 QTR or early 3 QTR FY16 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (March or April)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final RFP - 4 QTR FY 16<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Award - 4QTR FY 17 or 1 QTR FY 18</p>
<p>5. Below are some points of interest related to the forthcoming ATMP Draft RFP:</p>
<p>As part of the DRAFT RFP release, the Government anticipates providing a Government estimate of the Contractor Man-year Equivalents (CMEs), to include the recent requirements re-baseline. Offerors are advised that the estimated CMEs merely reflect the Government's estimate. The CMEs are in no way a required minimum or maximum, but rather an estimated average based on the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) developed for ATMP.</p>
<p>The work order data included in the Live Training Transformation (LT2) Portal ATMP Collaboration Area is provided as additional information for potential offerors. Offerors are advised that work order data may include labor hours in excess of ATMP RFP requirements due to 1 - extra customer funded support captured in work order labor hours, and 2 - changes in requirements from WFF to ATMP. However, offerors are advised to consider only the Solicitation requirements and its associated attachments in development of its proposals.</p>
<p>6. Any questions or comments in response to this announcement shall be submitted to the ATMP mailbox at usarmy.orlando.peo-stri.mbx.atmp@mail.mil.</p>
<p>7. DISCLAIMER: The information provided in this notice is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. This notice DOES NOT constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject services. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification. No basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this announcement.</p>

<SUBJECT>Opposing Forces Surrogate Wheeled Vehicles (OSWV) Visual Modifications (VISMODs) for the Combat Training Centers (CTCs) - (POSTPONED)
<SOLNBR>W900KK-15-RFI-OSWV
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>031416
<ARCHDATE>04082016
<CONTACT>William Jensen, Contract Specialist, Phone 4072083311, Email William.R.Jensen1.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>Update:</strong> Based on Department of Army guidance, funding for the OSWW VISMODs for the CTCs requirement have been deferred until approximately Fiscal Year 2019. As a result, this effort has been postponed. The Government appreciates the responses received and is utilizing this information as Market Research. <br /><br />The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager for Live Training Systems (LTS) anticipates future requirements to procure VISMODs to depict opposing force vehicles present in theater.
<p><br />OSWV supports the Combat Training Centers (CTC) Opposing Forces (OPFOR)/Contemporary Operational Environment (COE) Pillar capability by providing OPFOR OSWVs, technical vehicles, unique VISMODs, and Civilian on the Battlefield Vehicles (COB-Vs). This capability provides for an accurate replication of OPFOR and COB-V environment that rotational units must train against. The OSWV fleet is a collection of wheeled vehicles, used as training aids to portray threat vehicles including tactical vehicles, technical vehicles, and COB-Vs. These vehicular training aids are essential to the Army's ability to simulate the capability of enemy maneuver forces countering Unified Land Operations (ULO) during Maneuver Combat Training Center (MCTC) Decisive Action (DA) rotations. Each type of OSWV is composed of three components: the vehicle, VISMOD to make it appear as an OPFOR vehicle, and the Tactical Engagement Simulation System (TESS) paired to the Instrumentation System (IS) required to participate in CTC rotations. Both TESS and IS are developed under the Intrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) and Combat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) programs of record, respectively, with their own inherent requirements. Please note that TESS and IS development will not be included in this effort; however, OSWV shall be compatible with the existing TESS and IS systems.</p>
<p>The OSWV effort will require design, development, integration, testing, management, documentation, and delivery of OPFOR VISMODs to be adapted for the Stryker's, High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs), Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTVs) and commercial vehicles. The VISMOD design will use both tactical base vehicles temporarily converted into threat representation and be required to convert back if needed return to the Army inventory and commercial vehicles. The VISMODs shall be durable enough to withstand strong vibration and impacts, and have signature fidelity for visual and thermal (paint on modifications must match reflectance of standard US paint and thermal shall replicate physics that match threat as closely as possible). The VISMODs shall be safe, crew and passenger accessible and be sufficiently distinct from Blue Force (BLUFOR) system platforms. VISMOD examples include: light/medium and heavy machine gun, VISMOD mortar systems, and VISMOD air defense modules.</p>
<p>The Government plans to procure the following VISMODs as follows:</p>
<p>Acquisition Approach: If funding is made available, the Government anticipates a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Order with a Time and Material (T&amp;M) Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS). The period of performance will be for no more than five years with a one-year base period and four subsequent one-year options. The base year (Fiscal Year (FY) 2018) will include a Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) to validate the production line, then move into Full Rate Production (FRP) to produce at least 31 visual modifications (see attachments for examples - one possible solution is a .50 caliber bolted to back of vehicle). The second year (FY 2019) will produce a quantity of 100 visual modifications. The third year (FY 2020) will produce 76 visual modifications. Year four (FY 2021) and year five (FY 2022) will be in support of Contractor/Organic Logistics support efforts.</p>
<p>Estimated Dollar Value: $23M<br /><br />RESPONSES REQUESTED: Responses shall include a capabilities statement (limited up to 15 pages including the cover sheet) that include the following: Company Name, Point of Contact, Address, Telephone and Fax Numbers, Email Address, DUNS number, CAGE code, NAICS Code (333318)&nbsp;and Small Business Size Status with any applicable socio-economic status such as Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), 8(a), etc.). Small businesses are asked to indicate interest in participating as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor. The capability statements shall also provide the following:</p>
<p>1) Submit a description of your company's capability in producing similar efforts in a secure environment consistent with the requirements above and attached documents.</p>
<p>2) Discuss your company's manufacturing capability to include the ability to manufacture required quantities within the proposed schedule and the ability to manufacture VISMODs that are durable.</p>
<p>3) Discuss your company's ability and familiarity with integrating, installing and testing VISMODs and other training devices.</p>
<p>4) Discuss your company's ability to conduct Interim Contractor Support (ICS).</p>
<p>5) Discuss your company's ability to develop and execute New Equipment Training (NET).</p>
<p>6) Discuss your company's familiarity and ability to integrate with Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) and Tactical Engagement Simulation System (TESS).</p>
<p>7) Respondents are reminded to properly mark any proprietary information. <br /><br />All responses shall be sent via email to William.R.Jensen1.civ@mail.mil. The deadline for submitting capability statements is 4:00PM (EST) on 9 October 2015. The Government will post responses to all questions via an update to this Request for Information after closing.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION is for Market Research purposes only and is being used as an instrument to identify potential technologies and sources that can provide the capabilities described within this notice. The information provided in this notice is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.

Additionally, all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. No basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this Request for Information.</p>

<p>Regarding the Experience/Past Performance Evaluation factor please reference Clause 52.215-9003 Use of Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR) Information in Past Performance Evaluation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM - STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) INFORMATION IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (APR 2014)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) General.</p>
<p>(1) Past performance is an indicator of a Contractor's ability to perform satisfactorily on future awards.</p>
<p>(2) When used in best value source selections, past performance information will be evaluated based upon the currency and relevancy of past performance information in order to reach a confidence assessment for each offeror from which offers were received.</p>
<p>(3) The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will evaluate offerors' past performance, which may include, but is not limited to, their record of conforming to specifications, conformance to the standards of good workmanship, adherence to contract schedules, and commitment to customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>(b) Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services may be used in evaluating contractor past performance.</p>
<p>(c) PPIRS-SR classifications are established for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/. Contractors are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and rating methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR procedures manual and the PPIRS-SR user guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.</p>
<p>(1) PPIRS-SR classifications. Specific information as to how PPIRS-SR determines delivery and quality classifications can be found in the PPIRS Reference Material, specifically the "PPIRS-SR Evaluation Criteria" document on the PPIRS-SR Website at http://www.ppirs.gov/ppirsfiles/reference.htm.</p>
<p>(2) Classifications are calculated based upon three years of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) Data sources for PPIRS-SR information can be found in the PPIRS Reference Material, "PPIRS-SR Evaluation Criteria" document on the PPIRS-SR Website at http://www.ppirs.gov/ppirsfiles/reference.htm.</p>
<p>(4) PPIRS-SR will make negative quality and delivery data reflected in the PPIRS-SR Classification available to contractors for review and challenge. This is accomplished within the PPIRS-SR system.</p>
<p>(d) The following procedures will be followed when the Contracting Officer evaluates PPIRS-SR classifications:</p>
<p>(1) The Contracting Officer may consider the volume of business on which the classification is based as a measure of confidence in the classification as an indication of performance risk.</p>
<p>(2) Specifics as to how PPIRS-SR calculations are affected when there is no delivery or quality information provided by the source data bases can be found in the PPIRS Reference Material, specifically the "PPIRS-SR Evaluation Criteria" document on the PPIRS-SR Website at http://www.ppirs.gov/ppirsfiles/reference.htm.</p>
<p>(3) In the case of a Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available in the PPIRS-SR, the Contractor will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(4) Contractor-caused discrepancies or delinquencies will be reflected in a contractor's past performance assessment. Repair, replacement or reimbursement of quality and packaging defects will not provide relief of negative DLA performance data. Contractor-caused delivery extensions, regardless of consideration paid, will be reflected in the delivery classification for contracts issued by DLA.</p>
<p>(e) The Contracting Officer may collect and analyze other relevant information in addition to any past performance information derived from PPIRS-SR.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM - STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) </span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">It is imperative that vendors validate their performance data in PPIRS-SR. Vendors must register at the PPIRS website https://www.ppirs.gov for access to view their past performance scores and negative delivery and quality records affecting the scores. The PPIRS-SR User's Manual provides information concerning vendor scoring, negative &amp; positive performance data utilized to calculate vendor scores, and the process in which to challenge discrepant performance data. The PPIRS-SR User's Manual may be found at http://www.ppirs.gov/ppirsfiles/pdf/PPIRSSR_UserMan.pdf Questions concerning PPIRS-SR may be directed to the PPIRS Customer Support Desk at (207) 438-1690.</span></p>

Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805, the Management and Operating Contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).&nbsp;&nbsp;BEA is seeking parties interested in potentially entering into a license agreement for the purpose of commercializing the technology described below.&nbsp;&nbsp;BEA does not make any representations, provide any warranties, or otherwise endorse or guarantee the suitability of this patent to a licensee's specific needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #222222; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">INVENTION SUMMARY:<br /></span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 9pt;">High temperature molten salt based electrolytes can provide a cost-effective technological solution to the manufacture of aluminum-coated metallic substrates for a variety of engineering applications, particularly in corrosive/marine environments. BEA has developed methods and systems for applying metallic coatings with a quaternary bromide containing electroplating bath and an aluminum anode primarily to develop corrosive tolerant compositions. The process may also be used in a broad range of applications providing high quality aluminum coatings on both ferrous and non-ferrous metals and divergent surfaces and geometries.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> Currently, chloride based plating baths are being used to electroplate aluminum on steel, brass, copper and other substrate materials but have multiple drawbacks including the lack of ability to form a diffused aluminum layer between the substrate metal surface and aluminum coating due to the relatively low plating temperature. In addition traditional approaches do not prevent the loss of functional electrolyte thereby often producing non-ideal downstream product characteristics. <br /> <br /> The novel BEA quaternary alkali bromide electrolyte plating system produces superior quality aluminum plated metallic surfaces, with better corrosion mitigation properties due to the formation of a diffused aluminum layer in between the metal surface and the aluminum coating. Also, the bromide plating bath can efficiently prevent the loss of the functional electrolyte that results in the formation of controlled product characteristics such as: smoothness, thickness, and adhesion of coatings on various metallic substrates.<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"><br /> </span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background: yellow;"><br /> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">This invention has associated intellectual property filing Patent Application No.&nbsp;&nbsp;62/193,376, "Methods and Systems for Aluminum Electroplating" which was submitted to the USPTO by BEA on July 16, 2015 and currently unpublished.</span></p>

If multiple parties are interested in licensing this&nbsp;intellectual property, BEA may select an exclusive licensing arrangement with a single candidate or choose alternative licensing strategies (e.g., non-exclusive or exclusive field of use licenses) to increase the probability of successful commercialization. BEA reserves the right to defer any licensing decision if, in BEA's sole opinion, the submitted business plans are unacceptable to BEA. BEA may consider inquiries made prior to the release of this notice and inquiries made through other channels. Although interested parties are encouraged to respond before the date provided to ensure consideration, all inquiries may be considered prior to a formal selection unless this notice specifically states otherwise.&nbsp;</span></p>

<DESC>A CONCESSION BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY FOR PASSENGER FERRY, EVENING PASSENGER FERRY, AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE SERVICE AT FORT SUMTER NATIONAL MONUMENT
<p>The National Park Service (NPS) will issue a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 10 year concession contract to provide for Passenger Ferry, Evening Passenger Ferry, and Food and Beverage Service at Fort Sumter National Monument</p>
<p>Fort Sumter is one of the most iconic sites in American military history as the location where Confederate forces fired the first shots of the Civil War upon Federal troops on April 12, 1861. The Park preserves the remnants of Fort Sumter and commemorates and interprets the opening battle of the Civil War and the Fort's role during the Civil War. The War Department transferred Fort Sumter to the National Park Service on April 28, 1948. The National Park Service accepted jurisdiction of Fort Moultrie in 1960.</p>
<p>The Park includes four geographical areas: Fort Sumter, Fort Moultrie (the site of the first American naval victory over the British in 1776), the Historic Coast Guard Station, and the Visitor Education Center at Liberty Square ("Visitor Education Center"). The Visitor Education Center at Liberty Square, located in downtown Charleston, SC, serves as one departure point for the ferry services to Fort Sumter. Fort Moultrie and the Historic Coast Guard Station are located on Sullivan's Island, SC. <br /><br />Visitors can reach Fort Sumter by ferry service or private boat. Visitors reach Liberty Square, Fort Moultrie, and the Historic Coast Guard Station by automobile.</p>
<p>Fort Sumter National Monument continues to represent an iconic attraction within the Charleston area, serving hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. Additional information on Fort Sumter National Monument can be found at http://www.nps.gov/fosu/</p>
<p>The concession opportunity consists of year-round passenger ferry service, including onboard food and beverage service, and seasonal evening passenger ferry service to Fort Sumter. The ferry will operate in Charleston Harbor and depart from Service-owned docks at Liberty Square adjacent to the Fort Sumter Visitor Education Center and a second ferry departure site in the Mount Pleasant/East Cooper River area.</p>
<p>SITE VISIT</p>
<p>The Service will host a site visit for organizations interested in bidding on this opportunity on Wednesday, January 13, 2016. The site visit will begin at 10:00 AM at Liberty Square with a visit to Fort Sumter and continue afterwards with a visit to Mount Pleasant Waterfront Park and Patriots Point.</p>
<p>The site visit provides interested organizations an overview of the concession operation, along with a tour of the Concession Facilities associated with the Draft Contract. If you plan to attend the site visit, please contact:</p>
<p>Attn: Tony Paladino, Concession Management Specialist<br />Fort Sumter National Monument<br />1214 Middle Street<br />Sullivan's Island, SC 29482<br />anthony_paladino@nps.gov <br />(843) 732-5025</p>
<p>Please RSVP at least one week in advance of the site visit. When registering, you must provide your name, the name of the organization interested in bidding that you represent, the primary contact for the organization and the number of people in your party. All parties attending the site visit must disclose to the Service the names of the interested organizations engaging their services. The Service will provide further information and additional directions by return email message to the primary contact.</p>
<p>All offers must be received by the NPS at the address listed in the prospectus no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, March 31, 2016, in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract. The prospectus describes the business opportunity and includes the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract. <br />The prospectus is available on the NPS website at http://www.concessions.nps.gov/prospectuses.htm, or you can receive a hard copy for $35.00. To request a copy of the prospectus, send a check for $35.00 payable to the National Park Service to Mark Morgan at the address listed below. This amount includes an administrative charge and Fed Ex shipping fee for each prospectus. Please include a physical address (no post office box) and telephone number. You may also pick up a printed copy at the Superintendent's Office at Park Headquarters for $30.00 (checks only). If you are planning to submit a proposal and have obtained your prospectus from the website, we recommend that you advise Mark Morgan, Concessions Management Specialist, Southeast Region, NPS, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA 30303 at (404) 507-5638 or e-mail at Mark_Morgan@nps.gov of your interest so your contact information can be placed on a mailing list to receive future responses to questions or amendments to the prospectus.

In the Prospectus issued December 10, 2015, the Service stated it would respond to questions about the Prospectus if submitted in writing and received by January 22, 2016. The Service received a large number of questions about the Prospectus, which were all received timely. While the Service responds to the majority of the questions in Amendment No. 2, it continues to review several questions pertaining to the requirement for a second departure site and will respond to those questions with a subsequent Amendment to the Prospectus. Amendment No. 2 also amends the Draft Contract Exhibit D - Assigned Land and Real Property Improvements (Concession Facilities) to correct the Land Assignment Boundary for Liberty Square dock and extends the solicitation period until 4:00 PM on Wednesday, April 27, 2016.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">The following updates the Prospectus issued by the National Park Service on December 10, 2015. The updates address the prohibition on the sale of water packaged in individual disposable containers, the provision of water bottle refilling stations on vessels, and an adjustment to the minimum franchise fee due to the additional requirements and prohibitions. The updates also adjust response requirements related to a second departure site.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">1) Summary of Business Opportunity, Page 2, Franchise Fee</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Delete the following, in its entirety:<br />"The minimum franchise fee is sixteen and three-tenths percent (16.3%) of the Concessioner's annual gross receipts"</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Replace with the following:<br />"The minimum franchise fee is sixteen percent (16.0%) of the Concessioner's annual gross receipts"</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><br />2) Business Opportunity, Page 7, Overview of Concession Services and Locations, Food and Beverage Operations</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Add the following:<br />"The Draft Contract prohibits the sale of water packaged in individual disposable containers of less than one gallon within the Park and on all Concessioner vessels used to provide the services under the Draft Contract."</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><br />3) Business Opportunity, Page 8, Second Ferry Departure Site in the Mount Pleasant/East Cooper River Area</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Delete the first bullet of the third paragraph, in its entirety:<br />"Charleston Harbor Marina located adjacent to the Patriot's Point docks used by the Existing Concessioner. Charleston Harbor Marina is a privately owned and operated facility."</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Replace the first bullet of the third paragraph with the following:<br />"Charleston Harbor Marina located adjacent to the docks used by the Existing Concessioner at Patriot's Point.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Delete the fourth paragraph, in its entirety:<br />"Each Offeror must negotiate with and secure use of one of these or another site from the appropriate controlling entity. The Service contacted each of the controlling entities for the three sites, requesting confirmation that each would be willing to negotiate with parties interested in this concession opportunity. Appendix L includes letters from some of the site owners confirming their willingness to negotiate terms of use with the Concessioner."</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Replace the fourth paragraph with the following:<br />"Each Offeror must negotiate with and secure use of one of these or another site from the appropriate controlling entity. The Service is aware, however, that the entities owning or controlling these potential second departure sites may not be willing or able to negotiate lease terms with Offerors prior to the selection of the successful Offeror, and the Service recognizes that some Offerors may have existing legal control of a second departure site while others may need to negotiate such control after the selection of successful Offeror. As such, Secondary Selection Factor 2 provides the option to respond differently depending on each Offeror's level of control of a second departure site. The Service prefers you either have legal control of the second departure site, or describe multiple, potential locations (that meet the minimum requirements described in Section 21 of the Draft Contract and Section 5)E) of the Operating Plan, Exhibit B to the Draft Contract) to improve your negotiating position in securing the second departure site post selection. See Secondary Selection Factor 2 of the Proposal Package for further information."</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Delete the third bullet of Section 5)B)3)(b) Access by Persons with Disabilities, in its entirety:<br />"Drinking Water.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
506-16-1-1527-0037	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER 
None
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
Base year with four (4) option years: $128,795.00.
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Labor, supervision, test equipment, technical manuals and transportation necessary to provide system software support on the Government owned Provation Endoscopic Imaging Storage and Reporting System at the VA Ann Arbor Medical Center, 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105. This system is used to store, analyze, and report on patient endoscopic examinations. Provation is the only source of support, updates, and upgrades to their proprietary system.


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

The Provation system consists of proprietary software used to store, analyze, and report on patient endoscopic examinations. Provation Medical is the only source of support, updates, and upgrades to their proprietary software system.


4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Provation Medical is the only vendor authorized to perform the maintenance and to provide the software support. Provation Medical is the owner of this intellectual property. 


5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
An intent to sole source was posted to FBO.gov from September 3, to September 7, 2015 with zero (0) responses received.
The Contracting Specialist also contacted the vendor to inquire if there are any authorized service representatives. The vendor replied that they did not currently have any authorized vendors. 


6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Acquisition Plan Action ID:  VA251-16-AP-0790

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 11, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 506-16-2-426-0002.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Follow-on firm fixed price contract for an Electronic Tracer System for Continuous Survey Readiness Compliance.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  Contract for an aggregated data collection tool to provide a standardized, structured and customized process linking it to the Joint Commission, Office of Inspector General (OIG), International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Systematic Ongoing Assessment and Review Strategy (SOARS) and other Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requirements and standards.  This should be a comprehensive platform for compliance.  A follow-on contract is needed for a one (1) year base with two (2) one (1) option periods.  

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

Only one Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1.  The vendor, Sterling Readiness Rounds, PO Box 612, 112 E 10th Street, Eudora, KS 66025, provides an electronic tracer system used for data collection within healthcare facilities to assist in compliance requirements and these tracers were specially developed for use at the Ann Arbor VA as part of the previous contract (VA251-14-C-0037) and the continued use of these tracers is vital to the QA program in Ann Arbor.  The vendor has had security background checks performed to be able to access our IT systems and possesses critical knowledge and expertise to assure VA Ann Arbor Joint Commission integrity.  Any disruption in service would cause a disruption in our survey/inspection program which is ongoing for compliance requirements. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  This procurement was previously competed with only one vendor responding which was Sterling Readiness Rounds.  The intent to sole source will be synopsized to FBO prior to issuance of the RFQ.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Based on the previously competed procurement, the Contracting Officer anticipates the costs to be fair and reasonable.  
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  This procurement was previously competed and only had one response, Sterling Readiness Rounds.  Switching companies is not in the best interest of the Government as the electronic tracer system has been tailored to the Ann Arbor VA.  Starting over with a new company is not cost effective as the vendor has critical knowledge and expertise to assure VA Ann Arbor Joint Commission integrity and the vendor has had all necessary security background checks necessary to perform work under this procurement.  Costs already incurred would not be recouped by seeking competition. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  None.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Sirsi Corporation is the exclusive holder of the EOSi.Web Enterprise Cloud product.  This is a follow-on contract and service renewal is only available through EOS International web.  All VISN 12 Library data is located in the EOS database, affecting all patrons and Library staff.
