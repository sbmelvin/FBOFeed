<DESC>The USDA, Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS), intends to procure assistance in conducting a survey to determine a baseline quality of grain sorghum for the 2006 crop year. For this effort, FGIS has developed a sample collection plan based on a statistical design to collect samples from eleven states identified as producing 98% of all U.S. sorghum.  The sample collection will represent a cross-section of sorghum grown in the U.S. at the beginning of the value chain, also known as the first point of sale of “Farm Gate”.  FGIS will arrange for the samples to be sent to the contractor for grading.

The tasks included in this procurement includes: A. making and recording factor determinations according to the regulations (United States Standards for Sorghum); B.  characterizing, quantifying, and recording an itemized break-down of the foreign material, C.  characterizing, quantifying, and recording an itemized break-down of the content of the damaged other grains contained in each sample, and D.  forwarding the data electronically to FGIS. 

The USDA intends to award a firm-fixed price per sample non-commercial Requirements contract for this effort.  The contract(s) will include a one-year base period with four one-year unilateral option periods. 

This will be a best value procurement.  It is anticipated that the formal solicitation, Request for Proposal (RFP) 026-M-APHIS-06, will be released on or about April 29, 2006 and posted on this FEDBIZOPPS website.  Please download the RFP from this website.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, FL is contemplating a sole source firm fixed price contract to McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Boeing Company, J.S. McDonnell Blvd, Saint Louis, MO 63166.

The requirement is for the Programmable Armament Control Set (PACS) Test Station as an upgrade to the current F-15E Operational Facility (OPFAC) Operator’s Test Console (OTC) at the Eglin AFB, Florida Datalinks Test Facility (DTF) by February 2008. The PACS Test Station will enable a weapons testing capability for the Fighter Data Link (FDL)/Link-16. The current F-15E OPFAC supports only datalink testing on the F-15E aircraft and integration testing of the FDL and Class II family of Link-16 terminals. When this upgrade is completed the added capability would be used for datalink testing on aircraft stores carried on the F-15 aircraft, weapon integration testing, simulated weapons testing, stand-alone subsystem testing, joint interoperability and weapons certification, and investigation and resolution of critical and non-critical operational issues. Specifically, the PACS Test Station will provide the power, cooling and the necessary interconnect wiring for the following PACS station main hardware: host PC (station control); Versa Module Eurocard (VME) chassis (WISE – Weapon Integration and Simulation Environment); real weapon support, including the weapon station disconnect panel and Conformal Fuel Tank (CFT) air-to-ground stores interface; power control and distribution, to include the Power Distribution Unit (PDU), power panels, and power hub; signal hub; PACS cooling fixture and Electronic Sequencing Unit (ESU) holding fixture; test point panels; and integration panels. The PACS Test Station must allow connection of pylons, launchers, and weapons racks. In addition, an optional CFT breakout box for 1760 bus stores testing of six positions will be included. In order to provide an integrated testing platform, the PACS Test Station shall be fully integrated with the existing F-15E OPFAC OTC at Eglin’s DTF.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not the Government’s intention to pay for information solicited at this time. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Boeing is the only company that builds F-15E aircraft, and they are the only company that also builds the PACS Test Station for the F-15E OPFAC.

Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Stacey Hughes, Stacey.hughes@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-0190, FAX (850) 882-4561 or Contracting Specialist, Lt.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Technology Services (FTS) intends to award a firm fixed price requirements contract on a sole source basis to NEC. The contract will support a requirement for federal agencies located at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) to obtain their local telecommunication services through GSA FTS.  NEC currently operates and maintains DFW Terminal D’s Public Branch Exchange (PBX) under the DFW International Airport Board’s (DFWIAB) contract number 7003598 that was awarded to NEC on 01 July 2004.  Additionally, migration of all DFW terminals, business center, and other outlying buildings within DFW to the PBX is currently in process that will eventually require all telecom services at DFW to be obtained via the DFW NEC PBX.  The DFWIAB was created 15 April 1968 by the Cities of Dallas and Fort Worth pursuant to the Texas Municipal Airports Act (now Transportation Code, Chap 22), and has sole jurisdiction over any and all entities within the geographic boundaries of DFW.  Because of the DFWIAB’s jurisdiction and authority, they will not allow GSA FTS to contract with any contractor other than NEC, the DFWIAB’s sole provider of telecom services at DFW International Airport, in order for GSA FTS to serve federal customers located within DFW. This contract will be awarded pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1). See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Forest Service is seeking proposals for supply and install of two steel girder trail bridges to be installed on the Methow Valley Ranger District, Okanogan and Wenatchee National Forest near Winthrop, Washington.  The performance period is negotiable provided bridges are installed, complete by end of 2007 working season. Project #1 is called the Pasayten Bridge.  This project consist of supply and install a 110-foot long by 8-foot wide, single span, steel-girder, trail bridge superstructure with wood deck and railing system across the Pasayten River at milepost 22.5 on the Hidden Lakes Trail #477. Work includes designing, fabricating, delivering and installing a prefabricated steel bridge superstructure complete with wood deck and hand rails.  The trail bridge substructure for this project has been constructed by the Government.  The project may involve a helicopter to transport the prefabricated trail bridge from the staging area to the project site and working in a designated Wilderness area.  LOCATION OF WORK - The proposed Big Pasayten trail bridge site is located on the Methow Ranger District of the Okanogan -Wenatchee National Forests in T 40 N., R. 18 E., Sec 14 NW ¼ of the NE ¼ Willamette PM in Okanogan County, Washington.  The nearest town accessible by road is Manning Park, British Columbia, Canada.  Access to the Big Pasayten trail bridge can be accomplished from several trailheads within the United States, but due to it’s remote wilderness location the closest road access is from north of the Canadian border.  The closest trailhead access south of the trail bridge is the Harts Pass trailhead and the Billygoat trailhead, located on the Methow Valley Ranger District of the Okanogan Wenatchee National Forests.  From Hart’s Pass trailhead trail # 478, the distance to the Big Pasayten trail bridge is approximately 17 air miles, or 24 miles by trail. From Billygoat trailhead, trail # 477, the distance to the Big Pasayten trail bridge is approximately 18 air miles, or 24 miles by trail. The distance from the nearest road in Canada to the bridge site is approximately 3 air miles, or 4 miles by trail.  The trail bridge site is approximately 2 miles south of the Canadian border, which is also the wilderness boundary.  The project site is only accessible by wilderness trail or helicopter.  Due to the project site’s location in the northern extreme of the Pasayten Wilderness, special provisions have been made to allow the transport of the bridge superstructure by helicopter.  Normally any motorized means of transport would be prohibited in a Wilderness area, but approval for helicopter use has been obtained to transport the bridge superstructure to the construction site, landing at the project site is prohibited.  Ground construction personnel would be restricted to hiking or horseback riding to the construction site.  The Government measured the tree height of one tree, among the many, at the project site on the west of the Pasayten River at 124 feet height.  SITE VISIT: A formal site visit is scheduled for May 25, 2006 at 9am at the Canadian trail head site, north of the project site.

In recent years the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet has experienced shutting down the parking lot due to flooding caused by heavy rains and or high tides.  Maritime Administration contracted for a feasibility study last year, to study and analyze the flooding of the existing parking lot and to provide reasonable technical solutions and concept estimates.  Terra Engineers, Inc was awarded the contract to perform this work.  MARAD accepted Alternative 6 CONSTRUCT OF A PERIMETER FLOODWALL WITH LITTLE OR NO FILL PLACEMENT as the final concept deliverable.  MARAD is now soliciting for design of the parking lot using the accepted feasibility study concept design deliverable as a concept remedy to the flooding.  The feasibility study included a topographic survey to identify physical and operational impacts to the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet as a result of modifing the existing parking lot.  The work required the engineer to mitigate problems for SBRF, considering energy conservation, pollution prevention, and waste reduction to the maximum extent practicable.  Concept design Alternate 6, is to install a sump and pumping station to pump out water that accumulates in the parking area when it rains by dispersing pumped water at the perimeter of the site.  The construction would include a perimeter floodwall with a hydraulic cutoff into the underlying clay.  Little to no fill placement is expected in order to reduce future settlements.   The resultant design contract will require the awardee to provide for all necessary plans, specifications and drawings required for a start to finish construction design and drawing package that will be sufficiently detailed and so organized so that the Maritime Administration can use this finial document (Statement of Work) as prepared/ written to move forward with a contract solicitation in order to award a construction contract based on the deliverable package defined above. This deliverable document would allow a contractor to perform all aspects of the construction of the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet Parking Lot located at 2595 Lake Herman Road, Benicia, California 94510.  The government is looking for the design to be completed within 90 days of award.   The contractor will also be required to provide detailed costs for the entire construction project to include an itemized breakdown of known and projected costs associated with the construction of the parking lot. These costs estimates will be included as part of the deliverable package. The contractor is also required to write into the plans, drawings, and design package all known federal, state or county environmental regulatory program requirements that would impact any contractor needing building permits in order to complete the construction project. The following documents will be available for review after release of the solicitation 1.	 Alternative design document number six. Included in the Parking Lot Flood Abatement Study and Design document. 2.	Photographs of the parking lot flood of January 7, 2005. 3.	Topographic survey of SBRF parking lot dated December 10, 2005. 4.	Settlement contours of entry road and parking area dated September 14, 2005. North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330.  Size standard for small business is $4M.

The NAICS Code is 541611 with a small business standard of 6.0 million. The Federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) has a long recognized the significance of sickle cell disease.  In the mid 1960s, MCH developed and disseminated sickle cell disease educational materials nationally.  Following passage of the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act in 1972, MCH, with initial funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), provided support for community based sickle cell clinics to conduct testing, counseling, and education.  In the mid 1980s, the Federal MCHB supported the development and implementation of State newborn screening programs for sickle cell disease.  By 1990, 30 States and jurisdictions had implemented programs with direct Federal support.  Currently all States mandate universal screening as recommended by the 1987 Consensus Development Conference on Newborn Screening for Sickle Cell and Other Hemoglobinopathies.   In 2002, MCHB funded 15 community-based grants and one cooperative agreement through its Sickle Cell Disease and Newborn Screening Program.  In 2004, Congress enacted and the President signed into law P.L. 103-357.  Section 712 of P.L. 103-357 authorized the Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Treatment Demonstration Program.  Its purpose is to develop and establish systemic mechanisms to enhance the prevention and treatment of sickle cell disease. HRSA will carry out the legislation through the support of a National Coordinating Center and Regional SCD Treatment Demonstration Collaboratives (Regional Collaboratives).  Each Regional Collaborative will support the work of five to 10 individual community-based treatment demonstration programs.  The community-based programs will facilitate the delivery of education, health promotion, patient and family support, state-of-the-art treatment, and continuous, coordinated care to individuals with SCD.  These programs also will develop collaborative agreements with: (a) a community-based SCD organization or nonprofit entity that works with individuals with SCD; (b) the SCD newborn screening program for the State in which it is located; (c) the Title V Maternal and Child Health program for the State; (d) the HRSA Regional Genetic and Newborn Screening Collaborative in its area; and (e) other partners. The scope of work requires the National Coordinating Center to (i) collect, coordinate, monitor, and distribute data, best practices, and findings regarding the activities of the Regional Collaborative; (ii) develop a model protocol for eligible entities with respect to the prevention and treatment of SCD; (iii) develop educational materials regarding the prevention and treatment of SCD; and (iv) prepare and submit to Congress a final report that includes recommendations regarding the effectiveness of the Regional Collaborative and such direct outcome measures as--(I) the number and type of health care resources utilized (such as emergency room visits, hospital visits, length of stay, and physician visits for individuals with SCD; and (II) the number of individuals that were tested and subsequently received genetic counseling for the sickle cell trait.  The development and establishment of systemic mechanisms to improve the prevention and treatment of SCD requires extensive knowledge and expertise in the system of care that serves people with SCD and the SCD Community as a whole. This includes extensive knowledge and expertise in genetic counseling and testing; bundling of technical services related to the prevention and treatment of SCD; training of health professionals; treatment (including SCD treatment centers); continuity of care programs; consumer education; community-based SCD organizations or nonprofit entities that work with individuals who have SCD; SCD newborn screening programs and the maternal and child health programs under Title V of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) The contractor shall demonstrate familiarity with Federally-qualified health centers, reimbursement under the Medicaid program, State children’s health insurance program, and other health programs for the prevention and treatment of SCD.  This requirement is to be constructed as a three phase contract over four years.   This base year of the contract shall target on Program Planning, Program Implementation of Projects with Projects’ Evaluations, and Program Outcome Evaluation.  In addition to serving as a coordinating center for the demonstration program, the legislation indicates the Sickle Cell Disease National Coordinating Center shall:  (1) Collect, coordinate, monitor, and distribute data, best practices, and findings regarding the activities funded under grants (the Networks) made to eligible entities under the demonstration program; (2) Develop a model protocol for eligible entities with respect to the prevention and treatment of Sickle Cell Disease; (3) Develop educational materials regarding the prevention and treatment of sickle cell disease; and (4) Prepare and submit to Congress a final report that includes recommendations regarding the effectiveness of the demonstration program conducted under this subsection and such direct outcome measures as  the number and type of health care resources utilized (such as emergency room visits, hospital visits, length of stay, and physician visits for individuals with Sickle Cell Disease); and the number of individuals that were tested and subsequently received genetic counseling for the sickle cell trait. The anticipated evaluation criteria include:  (1) Statement of Understanding of the Project Purpose (2) The Technical Approach to Task (3) Personnel (4) Management Plan and (5) Organizational Experience and Expertise.  The Government anticipates award of a contract consisting of a twelve month base period and three (3) option years...  This is a pre-solicitation notice and not a request for proposals.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 5417   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement to modify "The Human Whole-Body Model " to include gender-specific physiology.  Presently, the current non-gender-specific model is used to simulate a wide variety of envionmentally-relavant health related scenarios.  The modifications, to include gender-specific physiology, will be in the same programming language (XML) as the model and will follow the same physiological principles as the presently-existing model.  The physiological content of the modifications are the responsibility of the  contractor and shall be determined by review and synthesis of the physiological literature.   This action is being pursued on a sole source basis because Biological  Simulators , Inc developed the model.  Any other contractor would be required, at a minimum, to become familiar with the entire model  in order to modify it which would be costly, delay research, and admit the possibility of basic misunderstanding and error.  NAICS Code 541511 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no  solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification  statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR AMPLIFYING FLUORESCENT POLYMER BASED IED DETECTION DEVICES.  This is a pre-solicitation synopsis which is not a request for competitive proposals.  The work will scale up manufacturing capacity for Amplifying Fluorescent Polymer-Based IED (Improvised Explosive Device) Detection Devices.  The DPA Title III Program Office intends to award an Assistance Instrument or a contract, as appropriate, on the basis of less than full and open competition for this requirement to Nomadics Inc., 1024 S. Innovation Way, Stillwater, OK 74074.  If a Technology Investment Agreement is awarded, cost share will be required.  Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement to establish a U.S. owned, domestic, merchant supplier of IED detection devices that are based on amplifying fluorescent polymer (AFP) technology.  The scale-up of production capacity for such devices and their associated consumable materials is needed in order to meet the future national security requirements for IED detection. The offeror may be required to be able to perform classified work in their cleared facility. The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 24 months.  A description of the task is as follows:  Scale up production capacity for detection devices, spare parts, and associated consumables that are based on AFP technology to meet quantity requirements for national security.  The ability of the offeror to scale up production and accomplish the related goals of this program will be assessed based on the offeror’s demonstrated ability to design and produce field-demonstrated, hand-held and/or robot-mounted AFP-based IED detection devices and associated consumables.  Additional phases to further increase production capacity may be undertaken depending on the eventual quantity demanded and the availability of funding. The government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), “Only One Responsible Source” or  “DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400 (b),” based on their demonstrated relevant experience and on their exclusive license to use AFP technology for explosives detection. Offerors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  This documentation shall specify the offeror’s area of expertise and experience.  It shall include detailed descriptions of amplifying fluorescent polymer-based explosive detection devices currently produced as an industrial supplier.  The documentation shall include a listing of products and services currently offered as a merchant industrial supplier along with market share in the area and a list of customer organizations currently using the devices.  The documentation shall identify relevant past, present and future research along with information on research budgets, personnel, and facilities.  The offeror shall document their experience in transitioning product from R&D to production.  Explosive detection devices that are not based on amplifying fluorescent polymer technology are not of interest to the government for this procurement.  Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.  Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement.  Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency.  Any information received for this Notice of Contract Action will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Numbered Note 22.

The National Electrical Grid of Kyrgyzstan JSC (NEGK) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to rehabilitate and strengthen the transmission grid in southern Kyrgyzstan.  

Southern Kyrgyzstan requires transmission upgrades in the form of new lines and a substation in order to eliminate overloading and avoid high power transmission costs from Uzbekistan.  The state-owned NEGK, which is the monopoly electrical transmission company in Kyrgyzstan and is responsible for all transmission with voltages of 110 kV and above, is issuing this Request for Proposals (RFP).    

NEGK requested the Feasibility Study to review routing alternatives and major risk and cost factors; assess the condition of existing equipment and transmission lines; refine the Project concept including line routing and load flow analysis; undertake a preliminary environmental impact assessment; prepare a detailed cost estimate; and determine the estimated development impact of the project.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $186,130 grant to the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed RFP, which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to NEGK by 3:00 PM, May 19, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  NEGK reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  NEGK also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  NEGK is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>(1) INTRODUCTION:  The Department of Homeland Security, Office of 
Systems Engineering and Development, Counter-MANPADS System Program Office intends to issue Broad Agency Announcement SEDBAA06-01 for the Emerging Counter-MANPADS Technologies Assessment Program.  A detailed overview of the program is provided below in this announcement.  This solicitation is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and is considered a full and open competition.  Offerors under this BAA may include single entities or teams from private sector organizations, Government laboratories, airport authorities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and academic institutions.  However, the Department of Energy Laboratories listed in Appendix A of the BAA are excluded from submitting responses or participating as a team member under this solicitation.  These laboratories are considered DHS Strategic Partner Laboratories and are prohibited because of their direct participation in DHS programs through the Office of Research and Development.  All others may participate or submit a mandatory white paper and a full proposal in accordance with the requirements and procedures identified in this BAA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), small and disadvantaged businesses (SDB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVO) Small Business Concerns (SBCs), women-owned businesses (WB), and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Enterprises are encouraged to submit proposals and to join others as team members in submitting proposals; however, no portion of the BAA will be set aside for these special entities because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development under this topic.  The Government anticipates executing awards as traditional procurement contracts or as Other Transactions for Prototypes.  Offerors are required to register online, using the DHS(S&T) Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) BAA Website at http://www.hsarpabaa.com, prior to submitting a white paper.  White papers are due to the Government on May 12, 2006.  The DHS(S&T) Counter-MANPADS SPO plans to review all white papers in accordance with the evaluation criteria in the BAA.  After the white paper review, the Government will notify offerors, electronically or in writing, at its discretion, either allowing or not allowing submission of full proposals based upon that review.  The Government plans to review all proposals in accordance with the BAA.  Full proposals will be evaluated by a review panel using the criteria specified under Evaluation Criteria in Section 6 of the BAA.  Following that review, offerors will be notified whether or not their proposal has been selected for negotiation.  Multiple awards may be made under this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to fund none, some, or all of the proposals received.  It is the intention upon completion of proposal evaluation to notify offerors of an initiation of negotiation for awards or rejection of their proposal.  Awards will be made based on the evaluation, funds availability, and other programmatic considerations.  Potential offerors, should they have any questions concerning the BAA, should use the following electronic address for all correspondence related to this BAA is: SEDBAA06-01@dhs.gov.  Copies of this BAA may be downloaded from the FedBizOpps web site at www.FedBizOpps.gov.  The Government will not provide paper copies of this BAA.  (2)BACKGROUND:  Commercial aircraft are subject to the threat of attack by man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS).  The Counter-MANPADS System Program Office (SPO) within the Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security is currently demonstrating one of the most mature technologies to defeat MANPADS using an onboard laser-based directed infrared countermeasure (DIRCM) system.  While that demonstration program is proceeding well, the Congress has funded DHS to assess alternative approaches employing emerging technologies that may have the potential for defeating MANPADS in a layered defense environment. Technology approaches to counter-MANPADS other than aircraft-borne DIRCM systems are in various stages of development and maturity throughout  Department of Defense (DoD) programs.  The DHS Counter-MANPADS SPO is following such technologies and will make a formal technology readiness level (TRL) assessment of those technologies in terms of their potential application in the civil aviation environment.  The non-aircraft-borne DIRCM technologies sought are expected to be at TRL6 or TRL7 as described in the DHS TRL Chart.  The chart can be downloaded from http://www.hsarpabaa.com/manpads.  The major thrust of this Emerging Counter-MANPADS Technologies (ECMT) assessment program is to evaluate and demonstrate the emerging technology solutions that prove to be the most mature and promising in defeating the MANPADS threat to commercial aviation.  The solutions sought are based on existing component technologies.  This program will not undertake the development of new technologies.  This program will not assess aircraft-borne DIRCM systems.  Approaches to be evaluated are limited to ground-based systems, aircraft-borne non-DIRCM and hybrid systems.  This program may lead to further activities centered on the layered defense concept for protecting commercial aviation from the threat of MANPADS.  (3): PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND APPROACH: The overall objective of the effort is to perform TRL assessments of technologies that can defeat MANPADS, other than aircraft-borne DIRCM countermeasures technologies.  This program will attempt to determine system-level operational effectiveness, maturity of components, subsystems, software, system approach, and suitability for the commercial aviation environment, including deployment at or near airports.  The focus is on a “systems” solution of mature component technologies rather than on development of the component technologies themselves.  System level test and evaluation is desired, though test and evaluation may occur at the component or subsystem level.  The Department of Defense (DoD) is currently addressing some of the issues relating to component and subsystem elements.  It is the intention of the ECMT assessment effort to coordinate with DoD, work with potential vendors to assess the maturity and effectiveness of all relevant technology, apply resources to assess system approaches, and most importantly assess civilian environment interoperability.  The performance period shall not exceed 18 months from date of contract or agreement award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC)/Specialized Contracts Office (PKR) invites prospective contractors to review the Request for Quotes FA8802-05-PKR1.  It is the intent of SMC/PKR to issue additional (refreshment) TASS Blanket Purchase Agreements to support the purchase of Technical/Management Advisory and Assistance Services by the issuance of delivery orders against GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Professional Engineering Services (PES) 871 Multiple Award Schedule contracts.  The NAICS code for this action is 541710, para 11c which defines a small business as 1,000 employees. SMC/PKR recommends that contractors form teaming relationships for this effort.  In order to obtain a TASS BPA, a contractor must be determined qualified in accordance with the evaluation criteria provided and must have a GSA FSS 871, PES FSS.   In order to be a qualified team member, a contractor must have a GSA Federal Supply Schedule Contract.  The TASS requirement is for the acquisition of services and support covering the following 6 core competencies and their associated sub elements:  1) Systems Engineering and Integration (Requirements Analysis, Modeling and Simulation, Systems Safety and Environmental Impact, and Test and Evaluation); 2) Management Services (Configuration and Data Management and Management Service); 3) Specialty Acquisition Support (Manufacturing and Producibility, Quality Assurance, Reliability and Maintainability (R&M), Electromagnetic Interference/Compatibility (EMI/EMC), and Facilities and Ground Support); 4) Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) (ILS Performance Planning, Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation (PHS&T), and Continuous Acquisition and Life Cycle Support (CALS)); 5) Computer Resources and Software (Computer Resources and Software Engineering and Office Automation); and 6) Acquisition Security (Acquisition Security Support, Space System(s) Protection Program Support, Systems Security Engineering (SSE), and Acquisition Security Training, Orientations, and Conferences).  TASS Delivery Orders for Management Services, competency number 2 will be set-aside for small business participation only.  The ordering period under these BPAs is anticipated to be thru 30 Sep 06 with resulting delivery order period of performance up to 30 Sep 2008.  The Government reserves the right not to extend or to cancel BPAs in which the contractor fails to perform in accordance with the BPA or the Delivery Order, or in which the contractor has not received Delivery Orders.  To prevent conflicting roles, which may bias the contractor's judgment or objectivity, and to preclude the contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions, the contractor will be required to accept an Organizational Conflict of Interest clause in the BPA. In order to be eligible for award of a delivery order, additional Organizational Conflict of Interest restrictions may be imposed by the Government.  Additionally, the BPA will contain an Organizational Conflict of Interest clause.  The contractor must possess, or be able to obtain, an Industrial Facility Clearance of Top Secret at the time of award.  Personnel supporting activities under these BPAs must be US citizens and have a minimum of a secret security clearance.  There may be delivery order competitions where the successful offeror must have personnel with Top Secret clearances.  The place of performance will occur at SMC, its Detachments, facility of other selected users or the contractor’s facility.

Contractors must use the SMC/AXC website, https://ax.losangeles.af.mil/axc to obtain a copy of the RFQ and its associated attachments.  Please mail your response to SMC/PKR, ATTN:  Missy Mitchell, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467, El Segundo, CA, 90245-4659.

<DESC>Architect and Engineering Services Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract(s) request for SF330 due 5/16/2006. The United States Geological Survey (USGS), National Geospatial Technical Operations Center (NGTOC), has a requirement for multiple architect and engineering (A-E) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to perform professional mapping services. Each contract will consist of a base 12-month ordering period with four 12-month option periods. This is a partial service disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB) set-aside acquisition. It is anticipated a minimum of four awards will be made plus one award set-aside for service disabled veterans. In the event there are no SDVOSB offerors found to be qualified or the pricing cannot be mutually agreed upon, the SDVOSB award will not be made. The total number of awards may be up to seven. The maximum total dollar amount to be awarded for all contracts under this IDIQ shall not exceed the threshold of $25,000,000 over the five year period. These services will be procured in accordance with Public Law 92-582 (Brooks Act) and FAR 36.6. This is a two part process: Part I - Offerors will submit their SF330 Architect - Engineer Qualifications by the response due date. The government will then evaluate and rate them. A separate rating will take place for the SDVOSB award. The most highly qualified firms will then be slated forward for consideration under Part II. Part II - Only the most highly qualified firms will be sent the Request For Proposal (RFP) to respond to by the date indicated in the RFP. These firms will be evaluated in depth and ranked in numerical order for award. A separate ranking will take place for the SDVOSB award. This announcement is open to all firms regardless of size. The NAICS code is 541330 with a size standard of $4.5 million. CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: All services provided shall be performed under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer, certified photogrammetrist, or registered land surveyor with demonstrated proficiency in all the services listed in this announcement. The required services include: photogrammetric mapping, survey and control services including cadastral surveying, aerotriangulation, multi-sensor aircraft data acquisition, high resolution topographic product generation, and some types of first generation orthophotography when it is not available as a commercial product. When it is determined by the Contracting Officer and the technical staff that a particular project substantially or to a dominant extent requires performance or approval by professional engineer, certified photogrammetrist, or registered land surveyor, then other services may be acquired such as; thematic mapping, land characterization, product generation, GIS Services, multi-temporal data, hyper-spectral data, acquisition of ancillary data, photo and image manipulation and interpretation, map digitizing, metadata creation, image scanning and processing, product validation, standard USGS raster and vector products, second generation type orthophoto, LIDAR, IFSAR, RADAR, digital multi-spectral and hyper-spectral imaging, including all other forms of digital sensor system technologies.

There is a mandatory 22% minimum acceptable goal for each contract awarded. A full subcontracting plan will be required prior to award in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and other appropriate regulations listed in the RFP. Specific details for each category will be included in the RFP. AWARDING OF TASK ORDERS: The pool of contractors will be evaluated on their past performance (quality, timeliness, and efficiency), current capacity, capability, subcontracting arrangements, and complexity of the specifications/scope of work for each new task order. The evaluation and selection for solicitation and award of individual task orders beyond the guaranteed minimum will be based on these criteria. An additional selection criteria will be included when the following situation exists: When a contractor collaborates with a Federal, State or local government agency to develop a project that is within the scope of this contract, and that government agency has negotiated a cooperative agreement with the NGTOC, and that government agency confirms the collaboration effort with NGTOC then this additional selection criteria will be included in the evaluation and selection for the task order providing that this process does not circumvent the government agency's laws or procurement rules and regulations. In the case of an impasse in specifications/scope of work, price or delivery date, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to offer the task order to another contractor. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to bypass the above procedures when the following apply: 1) emergency acquisitions, 2) services ordered are so unique or highly specialized that only one awardee is capable of providing, 3) sole source due to a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, 4) and minimum guarantee requirements. Some tasks may require the use of a classified facility or procedures. A classified facility is not required for base contract award. SDVOSB Set-Aside Task Orders: The Contracting Officer reserves the right to set-aside a portion of the task orders to meet the set-aside obligation. The criteria used to determine which orders will be set-aside are the same as those stated above. SELECTION CRITERIA: Part 1- The selection criteria are listed in the descending order of importance, with factors A and B being equal and factors D and E being equal, and within factor B, subfactors 1 and 2 are equal.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.  A Johnson & Johnson Company, 4545 Creek Road, Cincinnati, OH  45242 for a Neoprobe Gamma Detection System (sentinel node biopsy machine) for use by General Surgery in the Operating Room.  This product is a gamma radiation detection device for use in minimally invasive evaluation of cancer spread in melanoma patients. Some patients require metastatic disease evaluation of the corresponding draining lymph nodes.  The standard of care technique for such evaluation is sentinel lymph node biopsy, with a gamma probe for identification of the sentinel node during the operative procedure (ILM).  Neoprobe is a provider of the gamma detection devices used in these intra-operative lymphatic mapping (ILM) procedures.  The Neoprobe neo2000 Control Unit has a large display that is ideally suited for readability in all lighting conditions with a continuous count display that automatically defaults to continuous digital count.  Fixed counts and target-to-background ratios are also available.  There are present energy windows for most common radioisotopes used in surgery.  No calibration is required which is important because this eliminates possible instrument drifting.  Software updates can be upgraded in the field.  Multiple sound styles can be selected to suit user preference.  Energy windows can be changed to improve sensitivity.  There is full spectral characterization of any connected probe.  Neo2000 enables repeat testing for performance assurance.  Approved for patient contact within the mediastinum and also allows for open or laparoscopic surgical access.  Neo2000 has an AC power supply which allows for continuous operation and no limitations in length of case.  There are no batteries so no charging between cases is required.  The Neo2000 has a dynamic pitch audio with a clear signal that leads surgeons to local concentrations of radionuclide emissions. The probes are extremely sensitive which is important when identifying a faint, low-uptake node. Symphonic quality sound is programmed into this system with four dynamic audio ranges for targeting a wide range of local uptake.  There is also a built in Auto-Range feature to maximize audio discrimination over any local target.  If your firm has equipment which can meet the above-described requirements, please submit descriptive literature and supporting documents to Pamela.Rayburg @med.va.gov or by fax to Pamela Rayburg at 412-365-5444 NLT 4/24/06 COB 4:30 P.M.  Whether or not to issue a competitive solicitation is solely at the discretion of the VAPHS Contracting Officer.  Technical questions can be referred to Dr. Charles Brown – pager 412-698-0177 or phone numbers at 412-688-6000 ext. 814627.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. 

NIDDK will be seeking an organization or an institution to serve as a Type 1 Diabetes Mouse Resource that will be responsible for importing, archiving and distributing unique mouse strains that are important for research in Type 1 Diabetes and its complications. The contractor will also be responsible for providing mouse production and distribution services to support NIDDK’s Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium (AMDCC).
The Type 1 Diabetes Mouse Resource (T1DR) will be designed to provide two core activities to support T1D translational research. 
•	The Repository Core (T1DR-RC) will be responsible for archiving and distributing unique animal models that are critical tools for translating T1D-relevant research from the laboratory bench to the patient’s bedside. A T1D mouse repository was initiated as part of the T1D Resource project in 2001, and was funded as a supplement to the NCRR-sponsored Induced Mutant Resource housed at the Jackson Laboratories in Bar Harbor, ME (http://www.jax.org/t1dr/). To date, nearly 150 mouse strains that are important for advancing T1D research have been archived and distributed via the Type 1 Diabetes Resource. This procurement intends to extend support for the existing Type 1 Diabetes Resource in its continuing mission to archive and distribute mouse strains that are important for advancing T1D research.
In its continuation phase, the scope of the T1DR will be expanded to include one additional core:

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. 

This project will be designed to procure, preserve and deliver human liver tissue and cells, suitable for cellular and molecular studies from a variety of end-stage liver diseases to researchers.  These tissue and cells would otherwise be discarded or be unobtainable to most researchers who are not a part of a liver transplant center. It is also designed to make normal liver tissue and cells available for research when such livers are found to be unsuitable for liver transplantation. 
This program will be restructured to provide for the establishment of the infrastructure for procurement and distribution of liver tissues and cells.  Only core services for the procurement and distribution of liver tissues and cells will be freely provided to investigators, while the scientists will be required to reimburse for costs for services outside the core ones.  

Currently, this program has served over 800 investigators in the field of liver research,  providing  1731 liver tissue specimens, and 1070 hepatocytes preparations.  Most of the requests, and therefore most of the specimens, had been normal livers. Most of these normal livers have been obtained from the remaining lobes of livers used for pediatric transplantation in which only the left lobe of the liver was used. Pathologic liver specimens were sent to investigators interested in the following diseases: 
Hemochromatosis; Hepatocellular cancer; Hepatoblastoma; Tyrosinemia; Alcoholic steatosis and cirrhosis; Non Alcoholic steatohepatitis; HCV  hepatitis; HBV  hepatitis  Cirrhosis; Primary biliary cirrhosis; Primary sclerosing cholangitis; Wilson's disease  Biliary Atresia; Autoimmune hepatitis; and Cystic Fibrosis. 
The contractor will be required to: collect whole or partial livers removed from liver transplant recipients at surgery or diseased livers removed from heart-beating cadavers; collect and provide normal liver tissue to investigators; maintain the capacity to retrieve, preserve, prepare cells and deliver available specimens to investigators; develop and maintain a cost-recovery system; coordinate efforts with Tissue Collection Centers; maintain the operation of information storage and management systems; comply with HIPAA standards; maintain a coordinating committee; and adhere to proper safety precautions at the Tissue Collection Centers in harvesting and distributing the human tissue.  

This request is for interested firms with the capability of providing the required services to submit a corporate capability statement along with projected pricing, to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above.

<DESC>NIST seeks information on commercially available mitochondrial DNA resequencing scanner systems. NIST may procure such systems after results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed after a determination is made regarding which mitochondrial DNA resequencing scanner systems can meet NIST's minimum requirements.

The system shall be capable of the following:

A scanner that can scan a chip tiled with DNA probes for the entire 16, 568 base pairs of DNA sequence of the mitochondrial genome in both the forward and reverse orientation and include redundant tiling of the 500 most common mitochondrial haplotypes.  

&#9679;The scanner should read small feature size of 8 micrometers.  Resolution should extend down to pixelation of 0.51 micrometers.  The laser should have a sensitivity of 0.5 chromophore equivalents/micrometers squared or less.  

&#9679;The software should be able to handle multiplex experiments and complete a single scan in 10 minutes.  This will keep experiment turn-around time under 48 hours.  The software should use adaptive background genotype calling scheme (ABACUS).  The "adaptive" nature of this scheme should use hybridization data from multiple arrays across multiple runs to factor in the uneven background occurring due to differing levels of cross-hybridization at each site, and  significantly reduce the occurrence of miscalls. 

&#9679;Scanner should have capability for automated controlled sample loading.

&#9679;Scanner should support software that performs batch analysis.  Once the batch analysis is completed, the software should generate a report containing individual and total numbers and percentages of base calls within the batch, and a detailed case-by-case list of genotype variations vis-à-vis the reference sequence.  The software should analyze the data and list the mutations in an Excel format, with the exact position, the wildtype sequence and the base change displayed side by side for rapid comparison.  

&#9679;The system should be widely validated for use on cancer clinical samples and should be able to operate in an environment running 10,000 scans per year.

&#9679;Laser Power – Should be auto-set solid state green laser and reduce gain drift due to aging optics components. 

&#9679;The following parameters have been used for NIST prior experiments and should be maintained in a scanner to ensure normalization of data.
Excitation – 532 nm (nanometer), 200µW
Emission – 570 nm, (nanometer) Long-Pass
Detector – Meshless Photomultiplier Tube, Red Enhanced
Displayed/ Saved Dynamic Range – 16-bit, (65535:1)
Power:  Voltage: 100-240V, Current: 4-2 A, Frequency: 50-60 Hertz 

&#9679;The scanner size should similar to a desktop with dimensions of 13 inches W x 18 inches H x 22 inches deep.

NIST is seeking responses from both large and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those having 500 employees or less.  Please include your size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture or sell commercially available mitochondrial DNA resequencing scanner systems are requested to email detailed specifications for such commercially available system(s) to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. Specifications shall include detailed functional and performance capabilities for the mitochondrial DNA resequencing scanner system. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the people counting system for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the people counting system, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk is seeking information on sources that are interested in and capable of providing workforce to supplement the current Icelandic contractors providing Household Goods (HHG) & Express pack-outs along with pack ups of other Government owned material as required by the Naval Air Station (NAS) Keflavik, Iceland.  The proposed effort will cover moving U.S. military personnel, U.S. civilians and their families off of the island in a timely and orderly fashion.  Travel to NAS Keflavik to perform the services will be required.

NAS Keflavik anticipates packing up to 12 HHG shipments (more than 1,000 lbs) and 18 Express shipments (less than 1,000 lbs) per day.  Icelandic contractors currently provide from 3/3 shipments per day up to approximately 6/8 shipments per day.  Additional outside workforce may be required to accomplish the additional pack ups and express shipments.  The minimum shortfall is approximately 6/10 shipments per day up to the maximum shortfall of 9/15 shipments per day.  Interested sources would be required to provide packing material, containers, transportation, personnel, berthing, food, and possibly work shipment out of a different port.

The following information is provided to help offerors determine their interest in the requirement:  Single personnel have less than 1,000 (1K) in HHG and all personnel will make two moves.  Category A - 736 families with greater than 1K.  Category B – 1,361 persons with less than 1K (736 Express plus 625 Single).  Modified numbers based on 30% of single personnel having greater than 1K are:  Category A – 923 and Category B – 1,361 (express moves remain the same).

Estimates by Weight:  10,000 lbs per family X 736 equals 7.36 million lbs.  1,000 lbs per express X 1361 equals 1.361 million lbs.  Total equals 8.73 million lbs.  Modified - an additional 4,000 lbs X 187 equals 750,000 lbs.  New total equals 9.5 million lbs.

Estimates by Container:  1 Family equals 1 Container - 736 Containers; 1 Express equals one-half Direct Procurement Method (DPM) Container - 381 DPM Containers.  Modified number equals one-half container - 830 Containers and 287 DPM Containers.

Periods of Performance:  Permanent Change of Stations (PCS) will not occur at high rates until late May/June time frame with increased pack out to begin in May.  If the Air Force (AF) moves slide to the right, a majority of moves are anticipated during mid-June to mid-August timeframe.  Calendar Days between 01 May – 01 Sep equal 122 days less Icelandic Holidays and Sundays 122 – (23) equal 99 days.  Current rates (at present work hours and contractor manning):  Category A - 2.5 and Category B - 3.6.  Mon – Thurs – 8Hrs/Fri – 4Hrs.  Total Hrs equal 36.  Desired rates:  Assume no significant moves in September – only small express shipments if any.  Contractor will work Monday through Saturday.  Minimum rates using remaining available time:  Category A – 736/99 equal 8 moves/day (7.43).  Category B – 1,361/99 equal 14 moves/day (13.75).  Modified Category A – 923/99 equal 10 moves/day (9.32).  Worst case rates (compressed move timeframe):  Assume timeframe from 15 Jun – 15 Aug equals 62 days – (2 plus 10) equal 50; 736/50 equal 15 moves/day; 1,361/50 equal 28 moves/day; 923/99 equal 19 moves/day.

If current Icelandic contractors are capable of increasing workload by working full day Fridays and Saturdays along with an additional 4 hours of overtime each day, 36 additional hours of packing/movement time would increase output to 5 moves/day and 7.6 moves/day respectively.  An option for self-pack may be considered.  Based on this information, outside contract requirements would range from 8–14 Category A moves/day and the possibility of up to an additional 20 Category B shipments, if self pack options/contractor incentives are applicable.

The following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard is applicable to this requirement:  484210 – Used Household and Office Goods Moving - $23.5M.  Your response should include the following information:  Type of company (i.e. 8(a), Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), Small Business (SB), Veteran Owned, Service Disabled Veteran, etc.), number of employees, revenue for the past three (3) years, relevant past performance on same/similar work dating back five (5) years and your company’s capability to perform the type of work required.  Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for the work as specified in this Sources Sought.  Also, please indicate if your company would propose as a prime contractor for this effort or as a subcontractor.  If you consider entering into a teaming arrangement, you should provide the name of all teaming partners, the type of teaming arrangements, and address the specific services each member will provide.  This information should be sent to FISC Norfolk by close of business (COB) on Wednesday, 26 April 2006, Attn:  Marsha S. Witcher, Suite 600, Code 230C, Norfolk, VA  23511-3392.  Email submission to marsha.witcher@navy.mil is preferred.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis intended to provide market research information for use in developing a solicitation for an effort to support the U.S. Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT), Big Crow Program Office at Kirtland AFB, NM.  Responses to this announcement will be used to identify interested qualified sources available in the marketplace.  Information requested from interested parties is described below. This special announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in support of the Big Crow Joint Multi-Functional Multi-Spectral General Support (BCJMMGS) requirement; and (2) to roughly gauge the capabil ity of those interested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level.  The briefings and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firms or teams ability to perform; ho wever, these will be utilized to make the final decision concerning the number and types of set-asides.  The responses to this notice are for Government planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a definitive intent to proceed with this acquisiti on. At this time, the Government intends to award multiple contracts for this requirement.  Further, we are exploring the potential to maximize set-aside opportunities for the BCJMMGS acquisition.  As the Government is unsure of the extent of anticipated small  and small disadvantaged business participation, it is undecided as to the specific number and/or set-aside awards to target during the development of its acquisition strategy.  Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for awa rd of a set-aside contract, PROVIDING THAT EACH TEAM MEMBER MEETS THE NAICS CODE SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD AND CAN ESTABLISH SMALL BUSINESS STATUS. The current Small Business Administrative (SBA) rules allow a set-aside when there is an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small business concerns when at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel will be perform ed by the collective efforts of the small business members of the team or all of the small business 8(a) members of the team.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 500 employees for this acquisition. The contractors will be expected to provide non-personal services for the Big Crow Program Office at Kirtland AFB, NM.  The project is entitled the Big Crow Joint Multi-Functional Multi-Spectral General Support (BCJMMGS). The complete DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) is posted at the following website: http://www.smdc-armyforces.army.mil/ CONTRACTING WITH US -  Contracting Opportunities - Big Crow Joint Multi-Functional Multi-Spectral General Support (BCJMMGS). The resultant contracts will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause.  To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Governments interest, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the cont ractors actual BCJMMGS performance. Any small business firms, including 8(a), HUBZone, SDVO, or Woman-Owned firms, intending to propose as a prime contractor (especially those planning to use the affiliation and teaming rules issued by the SBA) are invited to provide a capability White Paper  to the Government (limited to 15 pages).  The Capability White Paper must include the status of the small business (i.e., 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned-Small Business Concern (SDVO-SBC), etc.).  Interested firms should submit an email stating their  interest in providing a White Paper to the Government within 30 days after the date of this announcement to Phyllis Poyhonen at phyllis.poyhonen@smdc-cs.army.mil (Subject line for the email:  BCJMMGS Capability White Paper).  Large business requests for Capability Wh ite Papers as a prime contractor are not acceptable at this time.  Capability White Papers must mirror how you plan to propose.  If proposing as a team, the Capability White Paper must reflect the team and the team approach. The small business Capability White Papers will be due by 3:00 p.m. on May 15, 2006.  Responses to sources sought synopsis shall provide the respondents relevant technical experience in the following disciplines in support of field test and training along  with detailed description of their specific responsibilities.  Respondents to sources sought synopsis shall provide engineering level, explicit technical discussion (e.g., ACME Corporation wrote the controller software in C++, and designed the signal cond itioning unit for the beam control) when highlighting their experience as it pertains to factors below.  Utilizations of generalizations, cursory summations and non specific engineering terminology (e.g., ACME Corporation developed, was involved in the des ign of the electron accelerator and supported the design of the photon array) will not be considered as relevant experience.  The capability White Paper should focus on issues that affect the decisions as to the number/types of set-aside awards such as:  (1) Full Spectrum Radio Frequency (RF) Design (2 MHz to 45 GHz):  Respondents will delineate the breadth and depth of their RF design experience correlating specific designs, hardware and circuitry built with specific frequency and bandwidth of operation ( e.g., ACME Corporation designed a communication antenna that operated in the bandwidth 60 MHz to 90 MHz.) and application/utilization in support of field test on a myriad of platforms (e.g. airborne, ground, etc.).

<DESC>Market Research Inquiry. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) are considering a partnership with industry to develop a fish friendly turbine.  The goal of the project is to employ the latest technolog ies in turbine design and assessment as a proof of concept to support fish friendly or environmental based designs.  The resulting prototype turbine would be a replacement installed at the Corps' existing Ice Harbor power station replacing Ice Harbor U nit 2.  The Corps is submitting this inquiry to determine industry interest and to solicit industry comments on the potential design and acquisition process.       The Corps Walla Walla District expects to independently perform a preliminary series of design modifications of an existing Ice Harbor observational model turbine at our Waterways Experiment Station  Engineering Research and Development Center (WES-ERDC) facility prior to issuing a request for proposal to industry.  The purpose of this WES-ERDC preliminary investigation is to identify areas of the turbine and water passage with potential for performance and/or fish passage improvement.  The Corps anticipat es this information will be provided in the request for proposal to industry with boundaries placed on allowable changes or modifications to the structure and turbine.   We currently anticipate a contractor will be selected based on past performance, engineering and management capability, commitment to schedule, commitment to the overall project goals, technical approach and cost.  We expect a two phase process: Phase I, i nteractive and iterative design in association with the Corps through a negotiated cost plus fixed fee and/or incentive fee arrangement; Phase II, a negotiated fixed price or Fixed Price Incentive Fee for supply, field quality assurance and erection engine ering services of the final selected design with options for two additional prototypes. Phase I of the project would be the determination of the civil, hydraulic and mechanical design of the turbine water passages and runner.  The hydraulic design of the turbine water passages and the runner would be developed by a turbine manufacturing/desig n company with direct input from the Corps of Engineers design team.  The design process would be iterative in that conceptual design alternatives would be developed and evaluated utilizing the Corps physical hydraulic (observational) models in combinatio n with industry standard hydraulic performance models and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).  These investigations would be completed in a step-wise manner combining successes and eliminating failures.  Each alternative or feature would be evaluated for i ts environmental benefits, hydraulic performance, cost reasonableness and feasibility before selecting a final design.  Likely alternatives include, but are not limited to a minimum gap runner, a modified draft-tube optimized for high flow rates, modified stay vanes, modified wicket gates, hydraulically aligned stay vanes and wicket gates and a runner meeting requirements for overall pressure drop and maximum rate of pressure change.  The Government will own the final design of the prototype runner and may require the selected vendor to provide complete manufacturing drawings for use by the Government for future solicitations. Phase II of the project would consist of the supply of the collaborative prototype design developed under phase I.  A separate fixed price construction contract for installation of the final design as Government Furnished Equipment is anticipated to comple te the proof of concept design with technical input (erection engineer) provided by the Prototype contractor during installation to ensure correct installation. The Government is submitting this inquiry to (1) determine industry interest and (2) solicit industry comments regarding the proposed design, and acquisition process.  Please indicate your interest and submi t any comments to Phyllis Buerstatte, Contract Specialist, 201 N. Third Ave, Walla Walla, WA 99362 or by email to  Phyllis.L.Buerstatte@usace.army.mil  and Tracy.L.Wickham@usace.army.mil   Your response to this announcement should be received on or before May 09, 2006.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and 
"foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>QUESTIONS: Could you be specific as to the training dates,  and how the training will be structured.   eg--is one person training continuously or given a set amount of training hours or days?  How many hours does each person train per year?  Is this more like a martial arts studio training environment where the stu dents come in around their other activities or a set training plan? ANSWERS:  The offerors should expect to provide a relatively open enrollment class during daily PT hours and more focused classes coordinated for specific teams and sections as required.  Those more specific classes would be scheduled twice a month at Group training  meetings within six week planning cycles.  Also it would be beneficial for the instructors to provide some style or technique set variation every few weeks, particularly in the PT time classes.
