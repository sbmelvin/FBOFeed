As a follow-up to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Market Survey Capability Assessment for the Oceanic Data Link Telecommunications Services dated March 10, 2014, the FAA is soliciting competitive proposals to provide telecommunications services in support of the designated FAA Oceanic Air Traffic Control Centers. These telecommunications services are detailed in the attached Screening Information Request (SIR) to include all attachments.

At the close of the Market Survey on April 2, 2014, the FAA received a number of vendor responses with some proposing alternative services that failed to satisfy the requirements of the market survey or proposing that the competition be set-aside for small businesses. Potential offerors are cautioned that the FAA is seeking a vendor capable of actually providing the very specific telecommunications services described in the attached SIR rather than mere assistance managing those services.

The FAA is issuing this SIR under a full and open competition acquisition. The FAA anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract except for the Engineering Services Task Order which are Time and Materials (T&M) with a one (1) year base and six (6) option years.
 
The FAA will not be liable and will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the SIR.  Therefore any cost associated with responding to this announcement is solely at the Offeror’s expense.

Prospective Offerors are hereby on notice that any amendments) issued to this SIR will be published under current announcements for FAA Headquarters. It is the Offerors responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates if any, to this SIR.

Questions and or comments concerning this SIR must be emailed in writing to the Contracting Officer. No other form of communication will be entertained. The proposal instructions, including due date, format and submission method, is set forth in Section L of the attached SIR.
