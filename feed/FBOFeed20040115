<DESC>We intend to issue a sole source contract to American Social Health Association for the period of eight months, starting April 1, 2004 through November 30, 2004 for the purpose of maintaining the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) National Hotlines.

A brief description of the CDC Hotline follows:  There are four separate hotlines. These address HIV/STD, response to HIV prevention public health campaigns, immunization, and a public response service.  These hotlines also include a Spanish and TTY service They are funded through the National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention (NCHSTP), the National Immunization Program (NIP), and the Office of the Director.

The following is a brief list of the tasks involved:  This contract combines previously independent hotline activities into a single contract requirement, consistent with CDC’s desires to enhance the delivery of health information to the public, and to increase the understanding of cross-cutting behavioral issues, while eliminating unnecessary duplication of costs (e.g., facilities, equipment, management) and lowering the overall cost to the taxpayer.

This contract will serve the populations of the United States, its Territories and Puerto Rico.  Hotline services include providing responses to the public’s questions, making referrals to national, State, and local resource networks, and forwarding orders for publications to clearinghouse providers.  All services are provided free of charge via a toll-free telephone system.

The hotlines utilize live operators (i.e., information specialists) as their primary resource to answer calls, with taped message systems acting as secondary back-up if demand exceeds availability of information specialists or if service is interrupted for any reason.  Through the combined use of these delivery systems, callers can access the hotlines 24 hours per day, seven days a week.

The purpose of this contract is to provide the general public with current, factual, clear and concise information about HIV/AIDS, STDs, responses to CDC HIV prevention campaigns, vaccine preventable diseases, and information about biological and chemical terrorism and other emergency public health issues.  Information that is disseminated shall be consistent with CDC operating guidelines and directives.  Public access to information is accomplished via toll-free telephone service.  Services will be provided via live operators and taped message systems.

Confidentiality of the call and anonymity of the caller shall be maintained at all times.  Information will be disseminated in a non-judgmental manner, with focus on responding to the caller’s questions, educating the caller in the skills and commitments needed to minimize health risk, and responding to the needs of the caller.  Services shall also include helping the caller accept and utilize appropriate referrals and other sources of information, and referring orders for Government approved publications to appropriate clearinghouse providers.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 04-06 Radio Frequency (RF) Guided Munitions; CLOSING DATE: 14 January 2005; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS: 1 March 2004; POC: Jim Freebersyser, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA04-06@darpa.mil, WEB: DESERT/index.htm.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, design, and testing to support the DARPA Radio Frequency Guided Munitions program.  The RF Guided Munitions program will develop enabling technologies for guided munitions capable of homing on enemy RF wireless communications.  The final demonstration product will be in an existing 81mm mortar round form factor and be capable of:  1) receiving RF communications signals, 2) processing the received signal to determine the location of the emitter on the ground, and 3) maneuvering the mortar to a trajectory that ultimately will impact near the target emitter.  The RF Guided Munitions program will require performers to hold Secret-Collateral clearances.

Note: This BAA shall remain open for one year from the date of publication in www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals or portions of proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the funds that are currently available will be awarded during the first selection phase.  To be considered for funding during First Selections, proposals must be received no later than 12:00 pm NOON Local Time in Arlington, Virginia, on 1 March 2004.  

EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proposes choosing to respond to this BAA will be evaluated against the following five (5) criteria: 1) Technical Approach, 2) Operational Utility, 3) Management Approach, 4) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA/ATO Mission and, 5) Cost Realism.  Agency evaluators will consider Technical Approach, and Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA/ATO Mission as more important than Operational Utility, Management Approach, and Cost Realism.  In accordance with FAR 35.016(e), the primary basis for selecting proposals for award shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE: Proposes choosing to respond to this BAA must read the attached Proposer Information Pamphlet that provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.

<DESC>Point of Contact for this project is June Ahrens at phone no. 817.886-1106. Fort Bliss has available for lease a 92.75 acre area that includes the William Beaumont General Hospital Historic District (WBGHHD).  This 92.75 acre area contains 39 historic structures that are currently under-utilized by Fort Bliss.  Since the buildings  and structures in WBGHHD are no longer required for their primary purpose (which was to support hospital facilities on the installation), some have deteriorated to the point that they now pose a health and safety hazard.The WBGHHD area is situated to the northwest of the Fort Bliss main cantonment area between Fred Wilson Boulevard and Hayes Avenue in El Paso, Texas.  The northern and southern boundaries of WBGHHD are adjacent to privately owned residential and commercial properties.  Recently constructed Army Family Housing, the Armed Services YMCA, and Dyer Street are to the east.  Directly west of the WBGHHD are the William Beaumont Army Medical Center, more Army Family Housing, Alabama Avenue, and the Franklin Mountains.  The entire site is separated fr om the main cantonment area of Fort Bliss.  Once fences and security gates are relocated, the public can be provided unlimited access to the site without passing through Fort Bliss security. An Industry Forum and site visit will be held on April 1, 2004, from 8:00 A. M. to 1:30 P.M. For inquiries and further information, please call Mr. Bill Tipton, Fort Bliss Real Property Office at (915) 568-3399, or visit the Armys Historic Properties web s ite at:   https://www.asaie.army.mil/Public/Partnerships/OHP/ohp.htm.  The Armys approach to this transaction will be discussed in detail at this forum.  Proposals must be submitted thereafter by May 3, 2004.

<DESC>NA The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Panama City, FL intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Hydroid, Inc. of East Falmouth, MA for two (2) off-the-shelf Paradigm Buoy Tracking Systems. These buoy systems will be used to track UUVs operated by the Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit TWO (MDSU2) and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit Seven  (EODMU 7). This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The hardware and software used for the tracking must be matched to the UUVs. The ATFP group currently uses UUVs that are manufactured by Hydroid Inc. using proprietary technology. The Paradigm Buoy System is a commercially available off the shelf system designed to support these UUVS. Hydroid is the only company licensed to provide an interoperable tracking system for these vehicles. Given these facts, Hydroid  Inc. is uniquely qualified to build and deliver the required systems.

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY, IDIQ, DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8A OR HUBZONE CONTRACTOR AND THE OTHER THREE ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-04-R-0077.  The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for activities in the southern area of the State of Texas managed by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The work will be at the following primary locations - Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and outlying airfields, Naval Air Station Kingsville and outlying airfields, and Naval Station Ingleside.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $75-$100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million.  Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range.  This procurement will include potential set-asides for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II. If an 8a or HUBZone contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include-Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation- including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8a or HUBZone contractor, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8a or HUBZONE contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction. Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable. If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 30 January 2004.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site.  The official planholders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.

This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.

<CONTACT>John Sherman Contracting Officer 3032360225     John_Sherman@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interiors' Bureau of Land Management (BLM) intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order using commercial acquisition procedures to IHS Energy, inc. 5333 Westheimer, Ste. 100 Houston, TX 77056.  The proposed procurement under NBQ040012, is for IHS Energy Inc. software maintenance.  Through its Fluid Minerals program, the (BLM) is responsible for managing the development of oil and gas and helium reservoirs by industry operators on Federal and Indian lands.  Currently, these reservoirs are being developed and produced in several hundred thousand oil and gas wells with over 25,000 Federal and 6,000 oil and gas leases.  BLM staff engineers, geologists, and technicians in over 30 Field Offices have been using well completion reports to determine if any wells drilled in the U.S., not just wells drilled on Federal and Indian lands, contain oil and gas and helium resources that belong to the public or Indians.  Since the late l950's the contracted Dwights and PI well service companies to provide such information on well completions as well as production data on individual wells or wells committed to unitization or communitization agreements.  About 15 years ago, IHS Energy Group bought Dwight's/PI and BLM has established yearly contracts with IHS to provide such data on CD ROMS, with monthly updates.  IHS is the only service company that provides such data.  IHS system provides input of data on well completions and production history into their system almost instantaneously. Continuing our contact with IHS without interruption is so critical to the operation and management of BLM's fluid minerals program.  Specifically, their Historical and Production Data CD's are much needed to: 1. Determine whether and to what extent oil and gas resources are valuable in developing land use plans, 2.	Determine if any Federal or Indian oil and gas leases are subject to drainage by well producing on nearby lands. 3. Ensure that public and Indian mineral interest owners receive their proper share of  oil and gas resources innitiziation, communitization, and other agreements 4.Conduct fair market fair assessment of Indian oil and gas lease sale parcel. 5. Determine if Indian oil and gas leases are being diligently developed. 6. And to do paying well determinations for oil and gas drainage cases, Indian diligence, and agreements using available automated software. 7. To do sample estimates the amount of helium resources that are contained in oil and gas wells on a nationwide basis.  Continuing to purchase IHS well data CD's through their Total U.S. coverage arrangement is the most cost effective means of ensuring that oil and gas well data is provided to BLM Field Offices in a timely, accurate, and efficient manner.  (WO-310 approved a purchase order during November 2003, to continue to fund an existing contract.  The contract number and purchase order information has been supplied to the NBC by Tina Bush and Angela Davis in WO-850).  Lamont provided me with an example of a justification for a single source contract from another BLM program.  I don't know the original contract No. for the IHS Energy Group Contract, but it should be on the information provided by WO-850.  interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement.  This notice of item is not a request for competitive proposals.  If no written response is received by February 13, 2004, to effect that comparable items/services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these items/services through a sole-source procurement with IHS Energy, Inc. a sole-sole award will be made.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION

	The Federal Bureau of Prisons intends to solicit and negotiate a SOLE SOURCE award with the Indiana Developmental Training Center (IDTC), 11075 Pennsylvania Street, Indianapolis, IN 46280, to provide secure juvenile inpatient hospital care.  Under Order from the U. S. District Court, a juvenile has been committed to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Because the Court has found that the juvenile is not competent to stand trial and cannot be restored to competency, the Court has ordered the juvenile to be placed in the IDTC for a minimum of 12 months or until further ordered by the Court.  IDTC is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to provide comprehensive residential treatment and educational services to children, adolescents and young adults with dually diagnosed emotional disturbances and developmental disabilities.  IDTC’s programs are licensed by the State of Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.  The award will be processed under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The period of performance is for a one year base period and two additional option periods of twelve months each.  Quantities for each contract period are estimated at 365 in-patient days.  This announcement constitutes the only announcement of this requirement.  Quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Because use of the IDTC has been ordered by the Court, a competitive procurement is not contemplated.  It is anticipated that an indefinite-delivery requirements type contract with firm-fixed unit prices will be awarded as a result of this notice using a procedures in FAR Part 15.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP) Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to PA Consulting of Washington, DC under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain expert technical support from PA Consulting in the development of revised coal supply curves and related materials.  PA Consulting is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement due  to the fact that it is the only known organization which has not been involved with the initial development or peer review of the Integrated Planning Model's (IPM's) new coal supply curves, that possesses independent expertise capable of performing this work. The North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620. It has been determined that because of the ability of PA Consulting to provide coal experts with a working knowledge of the IPM model and its use of coal supply curves not found among other vendors, it is the only vendor uniquely  qualified to meet this requirement. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be  considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via e-mail at rodgers.jami@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-04-00111, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-18.  The  associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 which has a small business size standard of 500 employees, however, it is anticipated that the contract will be awarded as the result of a full and open competition.  The purpose of this notice is to inform all  interested parties that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to award a Firm-fixed-price purchase order as a result of this solicitation.  Award will be made to a single contractor for all tasks.  BACKGROUND: The purpose of this contract is to support human  exposure studies in the area of pesticide method development. In order to correctly quantify environmental levels of pesticides in human exposure samples, it is necessary to use surrogate standards that mimic the physical-chemical properties of the compound of interest, but will not interfere with  analysis or be commonly found in the environment. The best and most direct choice for a surrogate standard is the compound of interest that has been isotopically labeled (carbon-13 or deuterium). The isotopically labeled compounds listed below are not commercially available, and therefore a  synthesis pathway must be developed. The pyrethroid pesticide family is a great area of interest due to their common pesticidal usage in indoor environments.  THE CONTRACTOR MUST PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASK:  Upon approval of the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) by the Project Officer, the  contractor shall begin experiments to develop a mechanism to synthesize phenoxy-13C6 cyfluthrin and phenoxy-13C6 cypermethrin, two isotopically labeled current use pesticides. If problems occur during the development, the contractor shall email a status report to the Project Officer stating the  problem, what steps are being taken to resolve the problem, and an estimated delay in product delivery, if applicable. The synthesis method must produce each compound with a final purity of  99% for both the isotopic labeling, and chemical purity. The contractor shall provide the project officer  with 10 ampules containing 1.2 mL of a solution of each individual isotopically labeled pesticide at 100  g/mL in nonane solvent for each compound listed above (20 ampules total). A printed certificate of analysis documenting the chemical purity, the isotopic purity, the concentration with error,  and methods of these determinations shall be provided by the contractor.  Deliverables:  A QAPP shall be provided by the contractor for this project within thirty days after project award. The QAPP must follow "Guidance for Quality Assurance Project Plans EPA QA/G-5"  found at  http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/g5-final.pdf.;  10 ampules containing 1.2 mL of 100  g/mL phenoxy-13C6 cyfluthrin in nonane;  10 ampules containing 1.2 mL of 100  g/mL phenoxy-13C6 cypermethrin in nonane & a Certificate of analysis of above solutions. PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Twelve months from date  of award.  PAYMENT: Partial payment will be authorized upon acceptance of each deliverable.   Price each deliverable separately. The government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the lowest price technically acceptable.  Only offerors  submitting technically acceptable proposals shall be considered for award.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation:  52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Item; 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Item.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the services of a contractor to provide technical assistance and training to Youth Transition Process Demonstration (YTPD) Cooperative Agreement grantees.  SSA awarded seven cooperative agreements to state agencies and universities in six states to develop service delivery systems to help youth with disabilities transition from school to work.   The grantees will establish partnerships to provide a broad array of transition related services to youth ages 14-25 who: 1) receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments on the basis of their own disability; 2) are at risk of becoming eligible for SSI because their disabilities are progressive; 3) have a prognosis for decreased functioning; or 4) have existing disabling conditions at age 18 that would render them eligible except for deemed parental income.  The contractor shall provide continuous technical assistance to YTPD grantees, organize and conduct training for grantee personnel, and develop and carry out information exchange among YTPD grantees and their staff.  Technical assistance will cover a wide range of topics; however, the core task will be to provide assistance that will enable youth with disabilities to transition to employment by way of career development, job coaching, vocational preparation and by working with school systems, including post-secondary education.  In addition, the contractor shall assist YTPD grantees in developing collaborative relationships with states, national and local organizations, schools, tribes, public officials, service providers, families and youth with disabilities.  SSA anticipates awarding a cost reimbursement contract with a base period of performance of one year from the date of award with the inclusion of provisions for an additional four one-year option periods.  The NAICS code is 624110, with a size standard of $6 million.  Solicitation number SSA-RFP-04-1006, is scheduled for release on or about November 14, 2003, with proposals due 45 calendar days thereafter.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE MAILED.  Telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders list will be maintained.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the FedBizOpps website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments that may be issued.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  All questions must be submitted via email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

<DESC>This action originally posted to the fedbizopps site on 6 January 2004 is amended.  The date and
time for submission of quotes is extended till 2:00 p.m. EDT on 22  January 2004.  Additionally, 
the following questions and answers are provided:  Question 1: Please clarify the proposal due
date  - Answer 1: The response date is revised to read:  22 January 2004 at 2:00 p.m.  Question 2:  
Please identify the number of hours that are included in each focus group (i.e., how long is each
focus group that is conducted?).   Answer 2: Approximately 3 hours per group.  Question 3: 
Please elaborate on the most likely digital format for which the recordings will be provided to the 
contractor.  Answer 3:  Recordings are made with Sony Memory Sticks, transcribed to a
CD in .wav format for mailing/transmittal to the contractor.  Question 4:  Please clarify what
is meant by having a finished product within 3 working days of receipt (does this apply solely to
the transcriptions?).  Answer 4:  This is solely for the transcription.  Question 5: The thematic
analysis and technical report should be based on the interpretation of all focus group sessions so
what is the anticipated time line for this?  Answer 5:  The Government anticipates the process to
take no more than 20 working days from receipt of the last transcription.  The analyses 
should consider SOF as a whole, SOF in each of the service components and specific
like USAR CA, AC CA, AC SF, NG SF, SEALs, Surface Warfare Combat Crewmen, AC
PSYOP, USAR PSYOP, AFSOC.  Question 6:  What is the rationale for specifying a PhD
degree requirement in Industrial/Organizational Psychology as personnel with other doctoral
degrees could also demonstrate the overall performance requirements.  Answer 6:  This is to
ensure that the person has a background in doing industrial-type operations and training
analysis. The input covers other areas and factors affecting training besides classroom
activities.   Question 7:  I'd like to know more about the process you all use to make your
recordings.  What type of electronic format they're in, for instance, DSS or WAV files.  Answer 7:  
Conversations are recorded on SONY memory sticks then transferred to CDs in WAV
files.  Question 8:  Also, is there any possibility of getting a sample transcript so that we may
review your formatting requirements.  Answer 8:  I don't have one now, and there isn’t
sufficient time to allow for sample transcripts.   Question 9:  For this type of work, we
generally charge by the page.  Other work that we do, we charge by the line.  What type of
invoicing method are you looking for, page or line?  Answer 9: This is a commercial service, and
therefore, the Government will evaluate the service based on your standard commercial practice and make the best value determination.   
Question 10:  When is the deadline for the submission of questions regarding the RFQ?  Answer 10:  There is no deadline, however, we do not anticipate any extensions beyond the new closing date of 22 January at 2:00 p.m.  Question 11:  The deadline for submission of the quote appears to be January 16th.  Is this correct?  Is there a particular hour by which the quote is due?  Answer 11:  The new closing date is 22 January 2004 by 2:00 p.m.  Question 12:  The solicitation did not provide direction regarding the format of quotes.  We intend to provide an overview of our proposed technical approach and timeline for performing the work, a description of our corporate and individual qualifications directly relevant to the current effort, a list of references, and a cost budget for performing the work.  Is this format appropriate for your evaluations needs?  If not, please provide a general format you would like to have for our quote.   Answer 12:  The Government has no format requirements.  We have requested a technical approach to include the corporate and individual qualifications, price, and past performance information for evaluation purposes; as well as the Certifications and Representations.  Question 13:  It is stated in the RFQ that the language training survey is an on-going/multi-year project.  Is there a possibility that you will be contracting more work related to this project beyond the current effort?  Answer 13:  This project is finite, there will be an additional project approx. 2 years into the future.  Question 14:  Is there an incumbent that is currently performing this work?  Answer 14:  No.  Question 15:  From the RFQ it is clear that the transcriptions are due back three days after receiving the digitally recorded focus group data.  We would like to know the following to better prepare our quote.  a.  What is the timeline for completion of the coding of the focus group data?  Answer 15a:   Coding by the data analyst?  If so, it will be a continuing process until the final transcription is received.   Focus groups are being conducted in 3 blocks per group: Langauge usuage in field; language training experiences; language issues and how to resolve them.  b.  What is the timeline for completion of the final report?  Answer 15 b:   Should be no more than 20 working days from the time of receipt of the last transcription by the data analyst.  Question 16:  From the dates provided in the RFQ we were unclear if the focus groups have already being conducted.  We understand that an immediate start date is required.  We would, however, like to know the following to help use prepare a more complete and accurate quote.   a.  Have the focus already been conducted?  Answer 16 a:  The focus groups are currently being conducted.   b.  How long is each of the focus groups (i.e., one hour, two hours)?  Answer 16 b:   Approximately 3 hours.  Question 17:  We are unsure how to link focus group participant responses from the digital record to individual focus group participants?  Without the ability to link responses to individual focus group participants it may be difficult to determine, for example, whether one or two respondents are providing multiple responses of the same thematic category or whether these responses within a similar theme are each provided by different respondents.  Thus, is there some method by which to link responses with their associated respondent?  Answer 17:  Primarily by voice recognition, although many will be addressed by name. Recordings will be very high quality digital, so most voices will be fairly easy to recognize.

<DESC>CORRECTION-THE PHASE I PROPOSAL DUE DATE WILL BE ON OR ABOUT 01 MARCH 2004. 
THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY, IDIQ, DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8A OR HUBZONE CONTRACTOR AND THE OTHER THREE ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-04-R-0077.  The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for activities in the southern area of the State of Texas managed by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The work will be at the following primary locations - Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and outlying airfields, Naval Air Station Kingsville and outlying airfields, and Naval Station Ingleside.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $75-$100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million.  Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range.  This procurement will include potential set-asides for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II. If an 8a or HUBZone contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include-Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation- including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8a or HUBZone contractor, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8a or HUBZONE contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction. Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable. If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 30 January 2004.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site.  The official planholders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.  Amendment will be posted on the web site for downloading.  This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.  Offerors must also be registered in the Contractors Central Registration, CCR, in order to participate in this procurement.  The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Proposal number is N62645-04-R-0003.  Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-16 are incorporated.  NAICS 423450.  Naval Medical Logistics Command has the following requirement for a ceiling mounted medical examination light.  The resulting contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with a 3-year ordering period containing a minimum for 22 units and a maximum of 500.  The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with Offerors on an open competition basis to procure ceiling mounted medical examination lights for Navy ships of the line.  Offerors are required to forward proposal and technical documentation by  21 Jan 04. 

Technical evaluations will be conducted in three stages. Stage 1 is compliance with minimum salient essential characteristics. Stage 2 will be the evaluation of Past Performance information and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. Stage 3 will be the shipboard installation and demonstration of the product and the evaluation of the pricing proposal. The Technical Proposal shall address all the minimum salient characteristics.  The Government will not assume that the offeror possesses any capability unless it is specified in the proposal. Proposals should include Past Performance Information from three sources to include: 1.) Agency name; 2.) Agency point of contact and telephone number; 3.) Contract number; 4.) Type and number of units provided; and 5.) Delivery and Performance Information (Contract delivery schedules and actual delivery schedules.) 6.) Quality (Total number of units submitted for inspection and total number rejected.)  Proposals should include Pricing on the following items: 1.) Ceiling mounted medical examination light and 2.) Complete installation to make unit fully operational.  Information on the existing mount can be requested via email to Wendy Graybill at wlgraybill@nmlc.med.navy.mil.  Pricing proposals shall include copies of published commercial price lists, or other documentation setting forth the prices charged to the general public for same or similar items. The Government will make award to the responsible offeror submitting the proposal that is determined most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  The evaluation of proposals will be based on an evaluation of the technical and price proposals submitted by each offeror and the shipboard installation and demonstration.  The technical evaluation factors are significantly more important than cost.  In the event that two or more technical proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences, the award may be made to the lower price proposal.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the low offeror.  Award may also be made on the basis of initial offers without discussions.  Therefore, offerors are cautioned that each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms.  Failure to submit any information requested would result in a determination that the technical or pricing proposal is incomplete and the offeror may not be considered further for award. Technical evaluation will be done in two stages.  Each offer must document compliances in Stage 1 before proceeding to Stage 2. Offerors providing acceptable results from Stage 2 will proceed to Stage 3. 
    
Stage 1: The technical documentation will be compared to the essential minimum salient characteristics and the evaluation factors listed below. Salient characteristics will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  The requirement is for a ceiling mounted medical examination light that has the following essential minimum salient characteristics: 1.) Shall be a ceiling mounted medical examination light; 2.) Shall have a minimum 150 degrees of rotation about the extension arm; 3.) Shall have a minimum of 60 degrees of rotation about the yoke; 4.) Shall have a minimum of 90 degrees of rotation about the vertical support of the lighthead; 5.) The light color shall be within 15% of 4500 degrees Kelvin; 6.) Shall have a minimum illuminance of 50,000 Lux; 7.) The focal range shall start at a minimum of 24 inches and not extend past 50 inches from the lighthead; 8.) The lighthead shall not cause a temperature rise of more than 4oC; 9.) The lighthead shall have a minimum rating of 500 hours on the light source; 10.) Ship’s power will be supplied to the product at 120 VAC. In addition to the above mentioned essential characteristics, the proposal shall state that the ceiling mounted medical examination light shall be capable of passing the following tests: 1.) High Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 2.) High Temperature (Storage) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF for 24 hours.  The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 3.) Low Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 40oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 4.) Low Temperature (Storage) -The test items will be placed in the chamber at -60oF for 24 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 5.) Humidity - Temperature will be set to 120oF and humidity was set to 90%.  The test items will be placed in the chamber for 8 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; and 6.) Vibration - The test items will be placed on a single axis vibration table.  The test items will be exposed to the MIL-STD 810E, Method 514.4 vibration signature (copies available) for 30 minutes.  This vibration profile is a composite of what the military believes the equipment will be subjected to.  They will be removed from the table and operated to determine if they function.

Stage 2 will consist of a comparative evaluation of past performance information encompassing subfactors 1) Similar Work, 2) Delivery and 3) Quality and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. 

Stage 3: The offerors who provide acceptable proposals based on criteria above will be requested to demonstrate their products on 29 Jan 04 at the Naval Sea Systems Command in Norfolk, VA. at no expense to the Government.  Demonstration shall consist of the following parameters: 1.) Offerors will be limited to three personnel to represent their company; 2.) The Offerors will be given one hour to demonstrate their products. The demonstration will be used to evaluate the time and tools needed to install and make the light operational within a shipboard environment and meet minimum requirements in Stage 1 (items 1-10). Offerors will be further evaluated in the area of pricing. Pricing proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors, Completeness, Reasonableness and Realism. 

A determination of award will then be made to the offeror who has demonstrated a product that represents the best value to the Government. After award the contractor will provide a sample of their medical examination light for acceptance testing. The Government will test the sample to determine compliance with all the characteristics listed in Stage 1 of this solicitation for survival within the shipboard environment.  Samples shall be 1.) Submitted at no expense to the Government; and 2.) Returned at the Contractors request and expense, which may be damaged during testing. Failure to meet the acceptance testing will result in a Termination of the contract and subsequent award to the next ranked vendor.

Questions received for Solicitation Number N62645-04-R-0003, Ceiling Mounted Medical Examination Lights

1) Are the lights to be used strictly as Exam Lights?
Yes.

2) Are there existing support structures installed in the ships to which the lights are to be attached, and if so, are the supports identical from ship to ship? Also we need complete details on the support structures (including dimensions), in addition to the adapter plate detail received.
The support structure is different for each ship and different for each space.  The adapter plate will allow interface with the base plate of any one of the mounts.  I have drawings of the more than 20 different support structures.  They vary in length and angle, this should only change the amount of wiring needed to complete the install.

3) The following dimensional information is required:
· The total interstitial space dimension between the finished ceiling and the structural ceiling above it.
· The dimension from the bottom of the existing support structure and the finished ceiling. 
· The dimension of floor to finished ceiling.
· A detail of any obstructions connected to the ceiling which could interfere with the operation and movement of the lights.

4) During the demo phase, will we install our lights aboard a ship, a facsimile of a ship or do we need to provide our own facsimile to demonstrate installation?
One of the requirements during the demo was that the vendor install their light into a real ship in the Norfolk area.
5) I am inclined to assume the wiring is already installed and available for our lights to be wired to the existing 120v. However it is a question I need to know for sure.
The base of the light is wired on all ships for these installations.
6) Do we need to quote conduit or is that in place as well?
All conduit is in place on all ships for these installations.

<DESC>This is a second set of questions and answers, with associated changes to the requirements of this RFP.

Q: Are only Small Businesses which meet the parameters and 
definitions per FAR 52.219-6 or NAICS 524298 (small business standard of $6 million) eligible to bid on this particular RFP?  Please clarify this "Total Small Business" set aside.

A: Upon reconsideration of the amount of data analysis required of the estimated 175 million claim records, OPM is hereby changing the NAICS code for this procurement. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is changed to 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, with a small business size standard of $21 million.  To determine if you qualify as a small business, please refer to the guidance in FAR Part 19 (a copy is available at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_19_1.html#1047137), or consult your local U. S. Small Business office (see http://www.sba.gov/).

Also, FAR clauses 52.222-41, Service Contract Act (SCA) of 1965, as Amended, and 52.222-42, Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires, are incorporated by reference into the RFP.  U. S. Department of Labor Wage Determination No.: 1994-2103, Revision No.: 30, dated 06/03/2003, applies to this procurement.  A copy of this wage determination will either be uploaded to the FedBizOpps website for this procurement, or can be requested by e-mail to the Contracting Officer.  The applicable SCA occupational labor categories, and comparable Federal hourly labor rates, are:
* 03074 - Computer Programmer IV, $23.71 per hour
* 03103 - Computer Systems Analyst III, $23.71 per hour

Q: Most Health Plan to PBM contracts stipulate that only a 
"big four" accounting firm can review pharmaceutical rebates or claims. Therefore, the bulk of the in-depth experience from which the OIG could benefit, would reside with a firm that has been allowed to work on these types of reviews at the large PBMs including those in your RFP.

A: The clause FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, is hereby deleted.  This procurement is now unrestricted, i.e., it is now open to competition from both large and small businesses.  Offers from all responsible sources will be considered.

Q: Under the "Proposal Submission Instructions" the RFP states we will need to describe the 5 most recent contracts completed during the past 2 years....Plus include information on all government contracts completed for the last 3 years. In our description of work....Are you looking for specific pharmacy claim data analysis/ PBM audit work experience? If so, how much importantance or weight will be given to this specific experience? I understand you can not disclose specifics here..but can you give me an estimate? (i.e., alot, some etc...?)

A: We are looking for prior experience you have had with PBM or pharmacy claims analysis.  If you have no prior experience in this area, we are still interested in any type of data analysis you have performed involving a large number of records.  A substantial weight will be given to companies who have prior experience with PBM claims analysis.

Q: With regard to training of OIG audit staff, can we assume travel and lodging associated with the onsite training and possible onsite assistance to the OIG audit staff during the course of the OIG audit is to be included in our fixed price?

A: Yes.  Please include travel and training costs in your fixed price proposal.

The closing date for recipt of offers (proposals) IS CHANGED by this modification to earlier notices for this solicitation.  Offers are now due by 3 PM, EST, January 29, 2004, at the Contracting Office at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW, Room 1342, Washington, DC.

<DESC>This is a third set of questions and answers for the subject RFP.

Q: In a recent modification to the solicitation, an indication was given that a “field dictionary” was available that includes descriptions of the fields in the standard prescription claims layout. Would it be possible to get a copy of this dictionary? 

A: The dictionary will be made available to the vendor selected to perform the contract.  The dictionary we have contains proprietary information; therefore, we cannot distribute it before a selection is made.  If you believe there is specific information that is necessary for you to submit an accurate proposal, we may be able to give you some additional information regarding the fields.

Q: I noticed in the modification that medical claims would be made available to allow for linkage of diagnosis with the pharmacy claims. Is a similar “field dictionary” available for this file and can we get a copy?

A: There is a dictionary for each file that will be used in the analysis.  However, as stated above, we do not wish to distribute this information until a contractor is selected.

Q: One of the requirements outlined in the solicitation is for the identification of potentially fraudulent prescription claims. One of the most basic types of fraud is the creation of claims for non-existent or non-eligible members. In order to assess whether or not such fraud exists, one must know who is eligible during any given time period. Will an eligibility file be available that will allow the contactor to assess whether or not there are claims for  non-existent or non-eligible members? And again, is a similar “field dictionary” available for this file and can we get a copy?

A: All information/files needed to perform the objectives listed in the RFP will be made available to the selected contractor.  Also, a dictionary will be provided for each file.

Q: The solicitation requires that the contractor evaluate whether or not the PBMs adhere to contractual agreements related to pricing, rebates, dispensing fees and other fees and practices. Is there a mechanism to access copies of the contract(s) so that we can better understand the analytic procedure that will be necessary to perform the work satisfactorily?

A: Copies of the contracts will be made available to the vendor that is selected.  However, because of the proprietary information contained in these contracts, we are not allowed to distribute these contracts.

The due date for receipt of proposals is UNCHANGED by this notice modification.  Your offer must be received by 3 PM, EST, on January 29, 2004, to be considered.

<DESC>Amendment #1 -- 
Following is a list of questions with OTS's response regarding the Professional Hacking Class requirements.

QUESTION:  Without setup requirements for the course, and the technical requirements to establish an appropriate training room, it is impossible to prepare an adequate response. The short turnaround time for a response to the solicitation seems to indicate a preferred vendor. 
RESPONSE:  The Government does not have a preferred vendor.  The short turn around time is based on a commercially available class, scheduling time, and workload demand.  
QUESTION: Is there a vendor currently identified for this RFP? 
RESPONSE:  A contractor has not been identified. The purpose of the competitive combined synopsis/solicitation is to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. 
QUESTION:  How many students will there be in the course? 
RESPONSE:  As stated in the combined synopsis/solicitation, approximately six. 
QUESTION: Does the vendor need to supply the training facility or will the government? 
RESPONSE: The Government will supply the training facility. 
QUESTION: Does the vendor need to supply any training equipment (personal workstations for exercises) or will the government? 
RESPONSE: The Government will supply personal workstations. 
QUESTION: How many days of training are requested? 
RESPONSE: The course length is to be determined by the contractor based on the the class requirements specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation . 
QUESTION:  What are the specifications, and desired agenda, for the course? 
RESPONSE:  All requirements are specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The contractor is to submit the course agenda based on the Government's requirements. 
QUESTION: When would the course be taught? 
RESPONSE: The course is to be taught in May, 2004.

<DESC>THIRD MODIFICATION TO RFP 14-03. RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED AND REVISED TO 12:00 NOON 06 FEBRUARY 2004 TO COINCIDE WITH ALL NATO NATIONS RESPONSE DATE. PREVIOUS SOLICITATIONS ARE ACCEPTABLE HOWEVER CONTRACTORS MAY REVISE THEIR SOLICITATION AS DESIRED.The Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) officially changed from an Operational Command to a Transformational Command of Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) on 19 June 2003. HQ SACT in Norfolk, VA, is seeking Contractor support for three projects to help complete the functional realignment of the two NATO Strategic Commands, establish effective output-based management processes, and deliver Transformation to the NATO Alliance.
	In Project One, a Command Structure Implementation (CIS) Team is being established to lead, advise, and oversee the restructuring and implementation processes that will result in full operational capability for Allied Command Transformation (ACT) by 30 June 2006. Team members will work with SACT Implementation Project Teams (IPT) on: evolving task development, identifying requirements for personnel positions, and conducting reviews and audits of Transformation activities. In turn, CSI Team members will convey information on IPT actions and activities to the HQ SACT Program Management Board where resource allocations are made.
Projects Two and Three address functional management/Balanced Scorecard and Information Management/Knowledge Management (IM/KM). These projects encompass on-going work and new requirements to ensure that functional management oversight is established to keep the Transformation maturing in ways that support the Alliance. The IM/KM project will support current ACT work in:
·	Strategic concepts, doctrine, and policy development
·	Concept development and experimentation
·	Requirements and capability planning and implementation
·	Joint education and training
·	Joint and combined future capabilities research and technology
The accompanying Statement of Work describes in detail the requirements of each of the three projects, functions to be performed, deliverables to be developed, positions sought, and requirements for candidate personnel.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed price contract to FN Herstal, Belgium for the procurement of four (4) to six (6) pintle-mounted M3M (GAU-21) .50 caliber machine guns and 24 M3M .50 caliber crew-served defensive weapon systems (CDWS) common to U.S. Navy and Marine Corps assault support rotary-wing aircraft.  The M3M .50 caliber weapon system will include the following:  a CH-53E rear mount, an Interface for CH-53E Rear Mounted Weapon System (RMWS), a M3M/MPH Took Kit for Operators, M3M/MPH Tool Kit for Armorers, a Periodic Replacement Parts (PRP) Kit, a Regular Replacement Part (RRP) Kits, M3M/CDWS Manuals (FFP – Operation/Maintenance/Illustrated Parts Breakdown, M3M Catalog Parts and Accessories, M3M Operator’s Manual, M3M Maintenance Manual), an M3M RMWS Training Manual, and Training (Armorer/Operator).   The 18 to 20 systems that do not include machine guns will be provided guns as GFE.  The system will be capable of a rate of fire greater than 1000 rounds per minute, a desired barrel life of 10,000 rounds, weapon depot level maintenance required no earlier than 40,000 rounds, the capability to use 100, 300 or 600 round ammunition cans, the capability to fire all standard NATO .50 Caliber ammunition to include SABOT ammunition, a total system weight similar to the XM-218 system with no greater than a thirty percent increase in weight allowed, the ability to maintain or increase the available fields of fire for each airframe, and the capability for dismounted operation by 1 person within 2 minutes.  In addition, the weapon system will be capable of being mounted on each of the following platforms: CH-46, CH-53, H-60, and MV-22 aircraft to include left and right door mounts for all platforms, a ramp mount for the CH-53, and integration on to the Improved Defensive Armament System (IDAS) for the UH-1 aircraft. The weapon system will include compatibility with Night Vision Device (NVD) capable targeting, pointing and illuminating laser systems.  A soft pintle mount for airframe stress reduction, improved targeting, and improved accuracy will also be included.  The operation of the weapon, along with the ammunition handling, feed, and storage system will not require electrical power from the aircraft or any other source.  The scope of the Common Defensive Weapon System (CDWS) contract shall include all of the efforts necessary to manufacture and deliver the 24 systems.  In addition, Herstal will design and develop the actual interface between airframe and weapon system.  This contract will be issued on a sole source basis to FN Herstal, the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the M3M.  FN Herstal is the only known firm whose product successfully meets the stated requirements.  To award the contract to another vendor would result in excessive duplication of effort and costs to the government.  FN Herstal is also sufficiently poised to respond to a rapid deployment capability.  See Note 22.

<DESC>As part of market research, The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is in the process of developing an acquisition strategy for exploring the option of re-engineering U.S. Air Force Studies and Analysis Squadron (SAS). The goal of this effort is to determine the possibility of a commercial agency absorbing the AETC SAS mission. This RFI is an attempt to locate businesses EXPERIENCED in formal studies and analytical efforts capable of providing valued analysis information to senior leadership. This RFI is not to be construed as a formal solicitation nor does it constitute a current or any future Government requirement. Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government. Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. The Air Force is only interested at this point in determining industry capability for the contemplated services. Request responses be provided NLT 30 Jan 04. Requirement: Air Education and Training Command Studies and Analysis Squadron (SAS) Service Summary The AETC SAS Squadron individually tailors studies for the AETC Commander and unit project officers. The AETC SAS services enable AETC leadership to make fact-based decisions on pressing AETC issues impacting the Air Force training and education environment. AETC SAS has three separate functions, the Command POC operational test and evaluation of new and improved weapon systems, the commands think-tank, and evaluates new technology for application to education and training. The Studies and Analysis Squadron is organized into three flights. Command Studies Flight is composed of a team of Air Force Scientist holding advance degrees in Operations Research, who answer General Officer level questions pertaining to Flying Training, Technical Training, and Professional Military Education. Studies range from quick turn (a few hours) to multi-year efforts. Example of a multi-year effort is developing a capability model for enlisted initial skills training that fully captures resource and readiness impacts. An example of a quick turn study would be answering a congressional inquiry into does AETC treat minorities fairly. Study outcomes are typically briefed to General Officers and presented at research conferences. The Test and Evaluation (TE) flight-tests AETC aircrew training systems and communications and computer systems. The TE Flight conducts test and test-related studies for new and modified AETC aircrew training and information management systems. The Technology Innovation (TI) flight acts as a quasi-battle-lab for AETC determining the effectiveness and return on investment of new concepts and off-the-shelf technology in education and training. The TI services require analysts with diverse backgrounds: space operations, communications, computer science, maintenance, and engineering; this provides TI analyst a unique perspective to bear upon a wide range of technology projects spanning many Air Force specialties.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the applicable electric, natural gas, and water distribution and wastewater collection systems at Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee.  Arnold AFB is located in middle Tennessee, just off of Interstate 24 and halfway between Nashville and Chattanooga; it is 7 miles SE of Manchester, TN.  The base covers approximately 40,000 acres, straddling Coffee and Franklin counties and situated in the tri-city triangle composed of Tullahoma, Manchester, and Winchester.  Arnold's primary mission is the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), which supports the development of aerospace systems by testing hardware in facilities that simulate flight conditions.  This heavy industrial center operates aerodynamic and propulsion wind tunnels, rocket motor and turbine engine test cells, space environmental chambers, arc heaters, ballistic ranges and other specialized units.  There are approximately 300 facilities on Arnold AFB, most located in the AEDC industrial area supporting the industrial mission.  Arnold Village is a small, 40-unit military family housing complex, VOQ, recreation area, conference/leadership facility, club, and golf course located at the Woods Reservoir.  Key to successful test operations is timely, accurate delivery of utility services.  Utility operation is fully integrated in plant management through a single Tactical Integration Group (TIG) in the AEDC operations center.  Utility operators are envisioned to be full-time, on-site partners in the TIG.  Test operations fluctuate daily, even hourly, with a high percentage of schedule change occurring.  Maintenance and Repair (M&R) requires close coordination with operations to ensure availability and safety.  Ultimately, utility service delivery may not be allowed to negatively impact test scheduling and test operation

Electric System –Electricity is provided to the base by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) via two 161kV circuits from TVA's Franklin Substation.  The primary power at 161kV enters the base from the southwest.  It terminates at the dead-end structure, which is located in the government-owned 161kV switching station.  The main switching station is constructed in a main and transfer scheme consisting of four oil-filled and nine SF6-filled 161kV power circuit breakers.  The main switching station provides power to two 161-13.8kV TCUL power transformers which in turn each feed a 15kV class metal enclosed switch gear utilizing vacuum breakers.  The 13.8kV 3-wire service from the metal enclosed switchgear provides electricity to ten (predominately overhead construction) distribution circuits feeding mainly facility power to the site, including five 13.8kV breakers (123,946 feet of overhead and 127,304 feet of underground wire service).  In addition to the 13.8kV circuits, there are twelve 161kV oil insulated underground circuits from the main switching station which feed 27 power transformers located at eight location throughout the test site area, with an additional five SF6-filled 161kV power circuit breakers and fifteen 161kV circuit switchers.  Annual consumption varies widely from 789,737 MWH (1994) to 361,615 MHW (1991).  Consumption averaged 607,968 MWH over past five calendar years.  Peak power requirements vary widely from 605,952KW (1994) to 356,544KW (1996).  Street lighting is provided along the primary roads with pole-mounted lights.  

Natural Gas System – The natural gas distribution system receives gas from a gate station at 100 psig for distribution throughout the base.  There are pressure-reducing stations in the system.  The system has approximately 10,000 feet of steel pipe, which is protected by a cathodic protection system.  The pipe sizes range from 12-inches to 3-inches in diameter.  Annual consumption is approximately 600-800 million cubic feet.  The primary use of the gas is for testing purposes, fuel for the steam plants and heating.

Potable Water Treatment Plant and Supply System – The water treatment facility receives water from Woods Reservoir via a secondary reservoir.  The treatment plant has a maximum capacity of 2.25 million gallons per day.  The treatment plant consists of two coagulation and sedimentation basins, three gravity filters, three chemical feeders, three distribution pumps, and one laboratory for operational monitoring.  Treated water is stored in two 250,000-gallon clear wells and one elevated tank.  The base water distribution system consists of approximately 25 miles of piping, 50 percent of which is 6-inches in diameter and below.  The remainder of the piping system is larger than 6-inches (upto14-inches).  The pressure in the distribution averages 60-70 psi.  There are approximately 145 fire hydrants.

Sanitary Sewer Collection System –The sanitary sewer system consists of 16 lift stations and approximately 55,000 feet of collection lines, which are mostly vitrified clay pipe.  The system flow discharges into the one of the base's wastewater treatment facilities, of which there are two.  The main plant (plant1) supports the AEDC industrial area.  A smaller plant (plant 2) supports Arnold Village area.  Plant 1 is a standard rate trickling filter plant, which consists of primary settling tanks, trickling filter, various pumps, aerobic digesters, and drying beds with a plant design capacity of 660,000 gpd.  Effluent is discharged into Rowland Creek.  Plant 2 is package type extended aeration design, with a capacity of 30,000 gpd.  It's effluent is discharged in Woods Reservoir. 

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  HOWEVER, BE ADVISED THAT SOLICITATION ISSUANCE IS ANTICIPATED ON OR ABOUT MAY 21, 2004.

Wright-Patterson AFB, located 10 miles east–northeast of Dayton in Greene County, Ohio, is headquarters for the Air Force Material Command (AFMC).  The mission of the AFMC is to research, develop, test, deliver and logistically supports every Air Force weapon system.  Wright-Patterson AFB occupies 8,145 acres with approximately 1,600 facilities on base plus 2,354 units of family housing.

Electrical: Dayton Power and Light (DP&L) provides power to Wright-Patterson via a 69kV line.  A secondary emergency delivery point is limited to 30 MVA.  The on-base distribution system was installed in the late 1950s.  The 69-kV transmission system delivers power to nine substations consisting of 69-kV circuit breakers, transformers and secondary switchgear.  The overhead and underground distribution systems are in good condition, and the overhead system has generous excess capacity.

Natural Gas:  Gas is supplied to the base by DP&Lat11 metering stations at a maximum pressure of 45 psig.  The on-base distribution system consists of approximately 131,000 linear feet of underground piping with numerous service regulators reducing line pressure at each building.  The piping consists of approximately 68% polypropylene, 28% steel, and 2% cast iron.  The entire distribution system has a weighted average age of 20 years.  Wright-Patterson currently uses approximately 20% of the total system capacity.

Potable Water: Water is obtained entirely from wells drilled into the aquifer underlying the base.  The base is divided into three areas with each area having separate well, treatment facilities and distribution systems.  Volatile organic chemical (VOC) contamination has been detected in almost all of the drinking water wells; the treatment process therefore includes VOC removal (through air stripping units), scaling control, chlorination and, for housing areas, fluoridation.  Potable water is stored in both ground level and elevated reservoirs in each area of the base; each area has electric pumps to transfer water to elevated storage, as well as diesel pumps for emergency purposes.  Excess capacity exists in all areas, with areas A, B, and C having excess capacities of 3.6 mgpd, 2.28 mgpd and 7.7 mgpd respectfully.

Sanitary Wastewater: The wastewater collection system centralizes all waste at one point, where it is pumped by a non-base pumping station via a 20-inch main to its ultimate discharge into the City of Dayton collection system.  The collection system consists of approximately 70% vitreous clay pipe and 30% sewer drainpipe; the average age of the collection system is 35 years.  Approximately 0.8 mgpd excess capacity exists in this system.

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  HOWEVER, BE ADVISED THAT SOLICITATION ISSUANCE IS ANTICIPATED ON OR ABOUT APRIL 23, 2004.  

Vendors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought including, commercial market information and company information via e-mail or facsimile (703-767-2382) to Kimberly Binns, no later than February 13, 2004.

<CONTACT>Steve Paschke, Senior Business Specialist, Phone 208-526-1113, Fax 208-526-0876, Email sdp@inel.gov
<DESC>In practice it is desirable to remove unwanted components from gas streams. For example many natural gas processes require the removal of carbon dioxide and/or hydrogen sulfide. The technology utilizes a basic two-step process design; first, multi-tray gas-liquid scrubbers affect unwanted gas removal via absorption to a liquid phase or solvent; and second, heating, pressure reduction or both regenerate liquid absorbent. Capture efficiency is predicated largely on liquid circulation rate and gas residence time.  Under the best of conditions, conventional towers operate at 80% of the equilibrium absorbent loading capacity. This means that at least 20% of the absorbent is needlessly regenerated at a significant cost. Approximately 90% of the process energy requirement is associated with solvent regeneration.  Additionally, conventional towers cannot be operated below 60% of their design capacity. This limits their utility for power generation applications in which peak and minimum demands may exceed this operating range. In the context of dilute waste gas removal from large volume gas flows, very large conventional scrubbers and regenerators are   required.  

The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has developed a new approach for use in situ gas separations.  Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube technology has been used for many years for small cooling applications. The operating principle of a standard tube involves the tangential injection of compressed gas into a tube with exits at either end. The gas undergoes expansion (Joule-Thomson) through the tangential nozzle and a high velocity cyclonic flow is formed. As the gas progresses down the tube, two distinct temperature zones arise – a hot zone near the tube periphery and a cold zone near the tube axis.  Due to isenthalpic expansion, the total gas flow is cooled; but, because of the unique temperature separation within the tube, the cold stream exits the tube at a far lower temperature than the corresponding expansion temperature. It is this aspect that has caused vortex tubes to be utilized for cooling.  In the nozzle and the exit chamber, the vortex tube can achieve high centrifugal forces, i.e., on the order of 100,000 g.  These forces can be used to separate components of a gas and/or liquid.

INEEL researchers have developed utilized a modified vortex tube to enhance unwanted gas removal.   The system achieves separation efficiencies >96%, with overall removal efficiencies of .5 moles of CO2/mole of DEA.  The device is physically small, inexpensive, and easy to maintain due to its near lack of moving parts.  These characteristics are particular advantageous when compared to other novel gas-liquid contactors, such as “structured packing” and “micro channel reactors”, which are operationally limited by plugging, low throughputs, and high costs. The modified vortex tube system manifest significant improvements, as compared to conventional systems, for dilute CO2 mixture separations including: 1) Lower capital costs; 2) Comparable CO2 capture efficiencies; 3) Lower maintenance expenses; 4) High process turn-down and scale-up capability when operated in parallel; 5) Reduced absorbent and absorbent regeneration requirements; and 6) Lower solution losses.

INEEL is soliciting qualified industrial firms to provide funding and development support to optimize the capture and removal efficiencies, test the removal of other undesirable gases (i.e. Hydrogen Sulfide, H2S) and to design and test a full-scale system with vortex tube array.  Upon successful completion of the development program the industrial firm(s) may seek up to an exclusive field of use license for the intellectual property.  This solicitation will close sixty (60) days from the Date of Notice.

<SUBJECT>R -- Sole Source Synopsis
<DESC>The Electronic Authentication Partnership (EAP) is being created to enable interoperability of public and private online authentication systems.  It is comprised of stakeholder groups, including Federal agencies, state governments, private-sector companies and organizations, and public interest groups.

The EAP is an outgrowth of a work group comprised of public and private sector participants assembled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).  CSIS in cooperation with the Federal e-authentication effort hosted a series of meetings of authentication experts from government and the private sector.  The goal was to create a shared effort for developing rules for credentialing on logical networks.  

The EAP will foster the interoperability of authentication systems by:

1.	Drafting rules for credentials and authentication systems for different and hierarchical assurance levels.  These rules should provide a standard set of criteria for evaluating credentials at each assurance levels.
2.	Developing a means to (a) assess credentials and systems against the standard set of criteria and (b) convey that assessment to relying parties. 
3.	Drafting ‘rules of engagement’ for relying parties that will allow them to use third party credentials.  These rules would take the place of bilateral agreements. 
4.	Creating operating rules for validating credentials and defining how validation of credentials will be conducted.

The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes to award a sole source contract to the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) to continue the support previously provided by CSIS.  GSA believes that only NACHA possesses the required capability and technical expertise to perform this requirement.  Any other firm desiring consideration must fully identify its capability to perform this requirement within the required timeframe and allotted budget.  GSA plans to make a sole source award to NACHA after fifteen (15) days of the publication of this notice.  Please note that this announcement is not a Request for Proposal and no solicitation will be issued as a result of this notice.

<SUBJECT>D -- Pre-solicitation Announcement:  Technology Support & Development Project (TSDP) for the FBI  (previously known as Information Technology Support Procurement [ITSP])
<DESC>Technology Support & Development Project (TSDP) is the name given to the follow-on effort to the Information Technology Support Procurement (ITSP) Contract, which will expire in 2004.    This change of project name was made to more accurately reflect the scope of the follow-on effort.  Once awarded, the TSDP contracts will encompass those continuing tasks that were previously handled under ITSP.  Contractors should not refer to ITSP or ITSP III when responding to this or any future TSDP notices.    
1.  The TSDP contract will require a full range of operational information technology support services.  The full scope of information technology services will be defined in the TSDP solicitation.    
2.  The FBI reserves the right to award up to ten (10) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with provisions for Fixed Price Task Orders utilizing pre-negotiated fixed price hourly labor rates.    
3.  This acquisition will be a total small business set-aside under NAICS code 541511 for which the size standard shall not exceed $21,000,000 in sales annually.  Total small business applies to any and all members of an Offeror’s team.  Large businesses, as primes or subcontractors, are strictly excluded from this acquisition.    
4.  The FBI's Information Resources Division (IRD) will administer the resulting contracts and, to the maximum extent practicable, will issue performance-based statements of work (SOW) with measurable performance outputs.  Several sample SOWs will be included in the full TSDP solicitation.  These SOWs will be for information purposes only and will not be evaluated as a part of the request for proposal (RFP).  However, IRD reserves the right to issue these SOWs for technical and cost proposals after the TSDP contract is awarded.    
5.  Most tasks issued under the TSDP contract will require assigned personnel to have active Top Secret clearance issued by the FBI.  Personnel clearances require at least 5 years of U.S. 
citizenship, absence of a felony record, no history of drug abuse, and a good credit record.  This is necessary for access to FBI mainframe computers and/or to have unescorted access to FBI

The following paragraphs identify specific sub-tasks to fulfill the requirements of this project. 3.1  Upon receipt of notice to proceed, the Contractor shall plant shrubs by hand, using planting shovels to properly place, space, and compact around each shrub as specified.  Planting shovels are the only acceptable planting tool for use in planting thes e shrubs.  The roots of all shrubs must be dipped in a water, vermiculite, and Terasorb slurry (materials provided by YTC) shortly before planting.  Ultimately, the planting shall be accomplished in such manner as to provide shrubs the best opportunity for  survival (i.e. full soil to root contact, proper planting hole depth and placement to prevent Ã¢Â€ÂœJ-ingÃ¢Â€Â of roots, etc.).  Shrubs shall remain in cold storage until the day they are planted to maintain dormancy, and any extra plants not planted eac h day will be returned to cold storage.  Notice to proceed will be based upon sufficient soil moisture and temperatures, and will be determined by YTC ENRD personnel.  The 66,340 seedlings will have approximately 8Ã¢Â€Â tops and 10Ã¢Â€Â roots with 5mm st em calip er at the collar.  Reaching some planting sites will require 1.5 Ã¢Â€Â“ 2 hours of travel each way, over extremely rough roads.  High clearance four-wheel drive vehicles are highly recommended.  3.2  Spacing and planting patterns.  The Contractor shall plant shrubs in several patterns, as determined directed by YTC ENRD.  Spacing of the plants shall be on 6-foot centers, planted in rows of alternating singles and triads, and in some small high-den sity islands with 3-4 foot centers.   YTC ENRD will identify specific sites and planting patterns to be used.  The goal of this effort is to re-establish a mosaic of shrub colonies that provide natural regeneration of larger areas, and specific habitat req uirements within these areas.  4.  INTERFACE:  Government use of facilities for this project is anticipated while work is being performed.  The Contractor shall coordinate with the YTC Operations Center to determine when training events are scheduled in areas affected by this project, a nd plan planting efforts around this training schedule. 5.
