<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services intends to solicit proposals for a contract with a Base Year and four (4) Option Years. AHRQ anticipates awarding one (1) contract under this solicitation. The purpose of this contract is to support the CAHPs (Consumer Assessment of Healthplan Providers and Systems) /SOPS (Surveys of Patient Safety Culture) programs at AHRQ.
<p>The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov. Interested offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about 15 days after publication of this synopsis.</p>
<p>AHRQ is the lead Federal agency charged with improving the quality, safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that provides evidence-based information about health care outcomes, quality, cost, use, and access. In addition, AHRQ is committed to writing, editing, and designing publications and other tools and materials that help our key target audiences understand how to put research findings and related products into practice. As a result, health care decision-makers (including consumers) are able to make more informed decisions that improve the quality of health care services.</p>
<p>In 1995, AHRQ funded the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Program or CAHPS&reg; (now called Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems) to develop and test surveys that consumers can use to assess the quality of care they receive through their health plans, from providers and in hospitals, nursing homes, in-center hemodialysis facilities, and many other settings. The CAHPS team also conducts research and develops guidance for reporting these data to consumers, providers and other audiences.</p>
<p>Also, as part of its goal to support a culture of patient safety and quality improvement in the Nation's health care system, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) sponsored the development of patient safety culture assessment (SOPS) tools for hospitals, nursing homes, and ambulatory outpatient medical offices. Health care organizations use SOPS data to identify activities, lines of communication, routine procedures and other areas where patient safety could be strengthened. In addition to the development of new SOPS surveys and databases, the CAHPS/SOPS4 contract will include the development of resources to assist health care organizations improve patient safety in areas of weakness. This contract will also include an exploration of the value of examining a particular health care delivery setting from the points of view of different but related types of data-for example, looking at hospital quality of care and safety through both SOPS and CAHPS (or other complementary) data. This could provide a richer and more complex picture of an organization's overall safety/quality environment.</p>
<p>Health care organizations use SOPS survey assessment tools to: raise staff awareness about patient safety; diagnose and assess the current status of patient safety culture; identify strengths and areas for patient safety culture improvement; examine trends in patient safety culture change over time; evaluate the cultural impact of patient safety initiatives and interventions; and conduct internal and external comparisons.</p>
<p>Specific activities under this contract include:</p>
<p>&bull; Supporting the development and maintenance of CAHPS and SOPS products.<br />&bull; Providing assistance to CAHPS and SOPS product users. <br />&bull; Promoting the adoption and use of CAHPS products and SOPS surveys.<br />&bull; Developing and maintaining new CAHPS and SOPS databases.<br />&bull; Providing technical support for meetings.<br />&bull; Managing all aspects of the project work.</p>

<SOLNBR>BAA-RIK-12-04
<CONTACT>Lynn G. White, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-4996, Email Lynn.White@rl.af.mil
<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-04</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The overall technical objectives of this BAA are to develop innovative, disruptive technologies and methods for the automatic and dynamic cueing and collection of intelligence for situational awareness and assessment, with an emphasis on Machine-to- Machine (M2M) capabilities. Technologies, such as artificial intelligence, ontological reasoning, and knowledge-based processing will be used to: (1) Automate the exploitation of collected, processed, and stored information in support of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) within air, space and cyberspace for on-going US missions; (2) Enhance the US exploitation system efficiency, to include multi-platform collections, multi-intelligence correlation, and resource optimization and management; (3) Dynamically characterize and correlate raw sensor data from existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems; and (4) Automate knowledge-based exploitation for Effects-Based Operations (EBO) through assessment, cueing, electronic attack, and battle damage assessment, as a means to achieve mission objectives. These capabilities will enable both automated and "man-on-the-loop" (MoTL) concepts to address the increased volume of data and the increased time criticality of analysis - both of which are necessary to support dynamic exploitation and real-time EBO.</p>
<p>The general focus areas of this BAA are to: (1) Dynamically characterize and correlate data sources on existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems; (2) Enhance collection system efficiency to include multi-platform collection for dynamic exploitation; (3) Automate knowledge-based assessments to cue sensors and recommend opportunities to achieve mission objectives; and (4) Automate exploitation of collected, processed, and stored information in support of ISR and Information Operations for current and future US missions. Some of the particular issues related to these specific focus areas include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) Target specific characteristics for identification/correlation. Battlefield management depends heavily on multi-intelligence assets to provide current threat analysis for successful deployment of war-fighting resources. One area that supports this analysis is target specific operating characterization and equipment/unit correlation, which is normally a "brute-force/labor intensive" effort; (b) Automated collection, signal ID, and first/second/third order level processing. Dense, hard-to-get, advanced modulated, and Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) signals, as well as movements and hidden assets, dictate the need for automated, dynamic collection using both on-board and off-board assets. Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT) &lsquo;fingerprinting' techniques should continue to be investigated as a means of supporting identification and automated tracking efforts; (c) Related enabling engineering constructs and architectures to enable advanced exploitation. For example, the Semantic Service Oriented Architecture (SSOA) construct contextualizes the dynamic knowledge available, thereby enabling dynamic discovery of new services as they become available and providing resources for enabling semantic descriptions of those services. SSOAs enable knowledge acquisition and management over disparate architectures without a priori schema information. Semantic SOA development will provide a flexible way to quickly integrate novel services using an intelligent matching process. Approaches are sought which will allow heterogeneous services to seamlessly interoperate and which may include the use of data mediation/intermediary translation services such as data transformation, aggregation, service orchestration and adaptation. A standards based design approach will be used, and as appropriate, will be compliant with all International Standards and with the Net-Centric; (d) Management software aboard platforms and systems which specifically address exploitation mission objectives. Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on advanced collection platforms, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Resident management software processing systems will need to accomplish the automated, dynamic collection of intelligence information as well as auto-collaborating with other sensors in order to share information and to derive knowledge; (e) Advanced knowledge-based processing for exploitation. Timely and accurate decision support to the warfighter requires innovative knowledge-based processing for sensor management, emitter and entity identification, and multi-intelligence cross-cueing, to include, but not limited to, techniques for automated knowledge acquisition and knowledge modeling, real-time inferencing, and real-time operating system; (f) Network-centric collection management, data/information exchange and correlation. Networked Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect difficult and hard-to-collect intelligence. Therefore, network centric collection management should be investigated to include, but not be limited to, multi-platform signal correlation and Multi-INT sensor cueing; (g) Technologies and capabilities to more fully leverage Motion Imagery (MI) information, to include, but not limited to: object tracking of both stationary and moving targets (robust enough to handle objects being obscured or leaving and returning into the sensors field of view), cross cueing capabilities across heterogeneous collections of sensors and platforms, visualization capabilities to display multiple intelligence data sources in a common geospatial reference, deriving accurate geo-positioning information, automated event cueing to alert on specified activities or configurations, and integration of automated MI or Full Motion Video (FMV) analysis with automated analysis of other intelligence inputs; (h) Technologies and capabilities for the acquisition and storage of Human Intelligence (HUMINT) information. HUMINT provides for up-close human based observation, and is often the first and last data source for evidence collection related to an event. Although this source can be very subjective, it can also be very productive and often times the only method by which the true effects of an action can be evaluated. It is critical to examine methods of representing and storing HUMINT data without compromising the sources; (i) Advanced Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques for use in a network-centric exploitation environment. This will include new algorithms, techniques and methods for meeting the future needs in the areas of Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Audio Processing, Special Signals, Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), Steganographic Intelligence (STEGINT) and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), as well as any combination of these. Consideration should be given to "surgical" exploitation techniques for reducing data and processing requirements through intelligent collection; (j) Execution of field testing for innovative MASINT technologies. The development of advanced algorithms which reduce the overall sensor intake, more intelligently process the data among the available resources/nodes, and addresses security, bandwidth, and load-balancing throughout the overall system will be given consideration.</p>
<p><br />FY12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: ELINT</p>
<p>The scope of the ELINT focus areas should include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Target characteristic identification/correlation; (2) Automated collection, signal ID sorting and first level processing; (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing/analysis technology at both the Operational/Tactical and Scientific and Technical Intelligence (S&amp;TI) levels; (4) Software aboard UAV platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives; (5) Advanced knowledge-based processing; and (6) Multi-sensor/multi-processor collection management.</p>
<p>FY12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: MASINT</p>
<p>The scope of the MASINT focus areas should include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Execute field testing of innovative MASINT technologies which includes planning, preparation, and conducting tests; (2) Prepare test plans, coordinate with test site personnel, analyze and document test results; (3) Acquire, transport, deploy, and operate all equipment required for the field demonstrations, including measurement equipment and ground truth sources; (4) Assist in obtaining any necessary frequency authorization for the field demonstration and measure any necessary ground truth and environment data. Testing can include collection and exploitation technologies across the broad spectrum of MASINT disciplines including electro-optical, laser, infrared, spectroscopy, radar, materials identification, radio frequency (ultra wideband, electromagnetic pulse, high power microwave, unintended RF emissions), seismic, magnetic, acoustic, and hydroacoustic.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<br />for a Free Space Optical (FSO) Communication System<br />at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, VA
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) seeks information from industry on current, existing technologies (or with possible minor modifications) that meet the network communication capabilities described in paragraph 1 - Capability Information Sought. Cost is a major consideration; therefore, the Government is interested in cost information for individual requirements defined in paragraph 1 - Capability Information Sought. Initial estimates will not be binding nor will they constitute a bid.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Air Force will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Combat Command (ACC) is seeking information from interested parties on a free space optical (FSO) communication system with a backup system capable of operation when optical communication is unavailable (e.g., due to weather). Initially, ACC requests information on technologically mature systems which integrate with existing fiber-based systems for point-to-point or point-to-multipoint ground-based communication across an active military runway at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the Government in conjunction with the nation's military and national laboratories would like to leverage current research and knowledge in free space optical communications. The complement of government resources and industry experts will provide an overall communications program that optimizes the investment. We are not seeking competition between government labs and industry.</p>
<p>1. Capability Information Sought</p>
<p>For this effort, the Department of Defense (DoD) Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) 2008, Change 3, published in September 2011, specifies the functional requirements, performance objectives, and technical specifications for DoD networks that support Unified Capabilities (UC). The requirements specified in the UCR for applicable network communications using a free space optical system are considered Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and must be satisfied.</p>
<p>The Air Force is considering alternatives for our current fiber-based network communications in support of the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs). The system may include hardware, software, processes, and/or support personnel. Any system technology with a DoD Technology Readiness Level (TRL) less than 7 (each component must have been prototyped in an operational environment) for phase 1 of this project shall not be included. Follow-on concepts may have a lower current TRL. In addition, we are seeking additional innovative information and approaches to solve the additional requirements listed below:</p>
<p>1.1. Offers full-duplex communications compatible with Ethernet protocol and with a backup system (e.g., radio frequency (RF) based and/or a high-gain avalanche photodiodes receiver, etc.) that allows system operation when laser-based communication is unavailable and/or degraded (e.g., due to atmospheric or network related anomalies).</p>
<p>1.2. FSO communication system will be in compliance with DoD security requirements to include appropriate encryption capabilities for sensitive information such mission data, e-mails, or secure websites.</p>
<p>1.3. Minimal USAF or DoD-specific maintenance support (e.g., software/hardware patches, maintenance support, network management, automated failover, etc.)</p>
<p>1.4. Seamlessly integrate with and augment existing fiber-based Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) and Secure Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) network communications architectures.</p>
<p>1.5. Offers FSO availability of at least 99% when visibility is 2 kilometers or more and backup network availability of at least 99.99% availability, respectively, in the Hampton Roads, Virginia area.</p>
<p>1.6. Provides point-to-point or point-to-multipoint ground communications over at least 2 nautical miles (NM).</p>
<p>1.7. System must allow for upgrades to provide ground-to-air or ground-to-space communications.<br />1.8. Laser must operate at an eye-safe frequency and power levels.</p>
<p>1.9. Free space optical system (to include backup) must operate at a frequency and wavelength which can be approved for use in, across, and around an active military runway and populated area (e.g., approved by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Air Force Spectrum Management, USAF Base Safety, Laser Clearinghouse, etc.).</p>
<p>1.10. Provide continuous data streaming and buffering for channel fades and outages.</p>
<p>1.11. System must automatically switch between laser and back-up system operation. The system must also automatically switch from the back-up system to the laser system once favorable conditions return.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION</p>
<p>All responses are expected to address the above items and provide estimates for:</p>
<p>1. Data speeds measured in Gigabits per second (Gbps).<br />2. Reliability of the entire system, measured in mean time between failures (MTBF).<br />3. Availability of the FSO and backup systems, measured in percent availability. <br />4. Manpower required for day-to-day operations and on-call for outages (include Government and contactor expectations).<br />5. Training for system operation and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) reach-back support with a clearly assigned point of contact (POC) and alternate including contact information.<br />6. Size, weight, power, and enclosure requirements.<br />7. Expected Government actions prior to installation.<br />8. (Optional) Expected Government policy implications of the recommended solution.</p>
<p>We expect respondents to be challenged by developing and/or selecting systems to satisfy the KPPs while looking for ways to satisfy the additional requirements and having the right data resulting in a high quality product. We expect a variety of options with pros, cons, risks, and discussion of trade space for the government to consider.</p>
<p>ASSUMPTIONS</p>
<p>The following assumptions should be used for cost and schedule estimation:</p>
<p>1. Cost/Schedule estimates should be at the 80% confidence level and respondents may also include figures from various confidence levels, if desired.</p>
<p>2. If implemented, this will be a multi-phased project. Phase 1 consists of establishing a reliable, stable, ground-based, point-to-point free space optical communication system with back-up. Phase 2 consists of enabling a ground-based point-to-multipoint free space optical communication system with back-up. Phase 3 consists of establishing a ground-to-air and/or ground-to-space free space optical communication system with back-up. Initial cost and schedule estimates should focus on Phase 1; however, respondents may also discuss elements of Phases 2 and 3. <br /><br />3. Phase 1 (ground-to-ground) solutions will be low risk using TRL 7 or greater hardware and software.</p>
<p>4. Phase 1 solutions should interoperate with current AF network management capabilities in order to provide visibility and network monitoring capability of the system.</p>
<p>5. Phase 1 system does not need to provide additional encryption capabilities (i.e., assume SIPR capabilities are encrypted prior to inject to the FSO).</p>
<p>6. Initially, this project will be a partnership between industry, national and military research laboratories, and the U.S. Air Force. Costs should include procurement, development, maintenance, and sustainment estimates for 18 months</p>
<p>7. Costs should be broken out to the lowest level practical.</p>
<p>8. Include program level costs - systems engineering, program management, integration, assembly and test, full-time support, etc.</p>
<p>9. Include discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations.<br />Again, these assumptions are given for cost estimation and planning purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes.</p>
<p>2. Capability Desired Technical Goals</p>
<p>The baseline requirement set is the DoD Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) 2008, Change 3, published in September 2011. The system must augment the existing fiber-based NIPR and SIPR network bandwidth using a free space optical system with a backup system. Additional requirements are listed in paragraph 16d.</p>
<p>3. Capability Sample Response Outline</p>
<p>Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government. Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit.</p>
<p>Section 1 - Technology Alternatives<br />Briefly describe one or more technological alternatives including the reliability, availability, and technology readiness of the alternatives (3-5 pages per alternative)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 2 - Feasibility Assessment<br />Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative, the system's technical specifications, and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks. Ensure any known incompatibilities with USAF or DoD networks or policy are clearly stated. Also, any known security vulnerabilities or other risks must be included. (3 pages per alternative)</p>
<p>Section 3 - Cost and Schedule Estimates<br />Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is an 80% confidence estimate of cost and schedule risk to produce a cost effective system. The assumptions in paragraph 16d may be used for cost and schedule estimation. These assumptions are given for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. (2-3 pages)</p>
<p>Section 4 - Corporate Expertise<br />Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant. In particular, please describe any projects that are similar in concept to include including management and operations approach, and any relevant lessons learned. (No suggested page count)</p>
<p>Section 5 - Additional Materials<br />Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussions deemed appropriate. Include any recommended structure of the requirements in the event the government plans to issue a request for proposal. (No suggested page count)</p>
<p>References Library<br />Reference documents are available only upon request and will be provided only to individuals with the proper security clearances.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command  New Jersey, Close Combat Center, ACC-NJ-CC intends to issue a Sole Source, Firm Fixed Price Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) modification to contract W15QKN-11-C-0126, for 170 Spider XM-7 Networked Munition Systems, including spare parts, and upgrade of Spider MCUs to software version 4 to the Spider Joint Venture (JV) consisting of Alliant Techsystems Operations (ATK) located in Plymouth, MN and Textron Defense Systems (TDS) located in Wilmington, MA.  The UCA modification will enable the Army to meet the established FY12 fielding schedule.
Other than Full and Open Competition is appropriate for this action in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 as award to any other source would create unacceptable delays in meeting the Governments requirements, resulting in an inability to meet the required fielding schedule. A UCA is authorized in accordance with FAR 16.603-2(a).
The Spider program is a landmine alternative program that addresses the capability gap resulting from the removal of persistent landmines from Army  inventory in 2010 as directed by the Presidents National Landmine Policy (February 2004). In order to meet the Landmine Policy and mitigate the capability gap, the Spider program acquisition plan called for production of Spider systems during LRIP to support initial fielding. The Spider XM7 Networked Munition is a landmine alternative providing equivalent capability to persistent landmines without the residual life threatening risks when hostilities end. Each system is controlled by a remotely located operator who monitors the systems sensors.
As this action will be issued as a UCA, no Request for Proposal (RFP) will be made available. 
Point of contact for this action is Nadine Schneider, Contract Specialist, ACC-NJ-CC, email: nadine.schneider@us.army.mil

This is a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (MA IDIQ) contract with, when applicable, performance based task orders for the Joint Program Executive Office-Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) and other customers under the auspices of the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP).  The cumulative total of all task orders awarded to all awardees will not exceed $495,000,000 over the life of the contract.  The Government anticipates that there is a strong potential for Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) to materialize over the life of the contract.  Organizational conflicts of interest occur when a firm has access to nonpublic information that would give it an advantage in competing for work. Conflicts also could appear when a contractor is performing tasks that are subjective and could have a financial impact. These situations would include a company helping to prepare a statement of work and then proposing on the same project.  NAICS Code 541330, Engineering Services for Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, applies with a small business size standard exception of $35,500,000.   Only offerors qualifying as a small business concern under this size standard are eligible to propose for work at the task order level within the Small Business Set-Aside Acquisition Domain. Performance of this requirement may include access or exposure to private information subject to compliance to FAR Subpart 52.224-1 and 52.224-2.  Performance of this requirement does include strict prohibition of dissemination of information / publishing that is subject to compliance with client requirements and data that is subject to data right restrictions by the client.  Any violation of such may result in administration of penalties.<br><br>Within this Commercial IDIQ contract vehicle, there will be six domain support areas: Acquisition (100% Set Aside for Small Business); Logistics (Unrestricted Competition); Business and Analytical (Unrestricted Competition); Engineering and Technical (Unrestricted Competition); Information Technology (Unrestricted Competition) and Medical (Unrestricted Competition).  For a further description of these domains and associated areas of interest, please see the figure below.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards in each domain and anticipates awarding a single task order per Area of Interest (AoI) within a Domain (~25 task orders).  During a task order period of performance, subsequent work will be added to existing task orders within the appropriate AoI via modification.  Offerors are permitted to propose in multiple domain support areas, but must demonstrate a total core competency in the domain for which they are proposing.<br><br>Task Orders may be issued for a one (1) year Base period and up to two (2), one (1) year Option periods.  The Firm-Fixed-Price IDIQ contracts recipients need not have an approved accounting system, but are still subject to restrictions/guidelines associated with defective pricing.  The guarantee minimum is $2,500.00 for the Base Period only. The Government envisions that multiple awards will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make a single award, if in the best interest of the Government.  If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or only one successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation.  The Government currently estimates that Request for Proposal will be posted within the next 60 days or less.  Any questions about this requirement must be submitted in writing to Lindsey Crockett at lindsey.m.crockett2.civ@mail.mil.  All proposals shall be sent to the address specified in the solicitation.  All responsible sources who submit a timely response will be considered for award.<br><br>100% SB SET-ASIDE ACQUISITION DOMAIN<br>-Program Management<br>-Program Analysis<br>-LCM Management<br>-Administrative Support	        <br><br>FULL & OPEN LOGISTICS DOMAIN<br>-Acquisition Logistics<br>-Logistics Analysis<br>-Technical Documentation Validation<br>-Sustainment & Maintainability	        <br><br>FULL & OPEN BUSINESS AND ANALYTICAL DOMAIN<br>-Financial Mgmt Services<br>-Mgmt, Org & Bus Improvement Services<br>-Specialized Analysis<br>-Training Services<br>        <br>FULL & OPEN ENGINEERING DOMAIN<br>-Engineering Support<br>-Specialized Engineering (Biomed, Communications, Electronics, etc...)<br>-Test and Validation<br>-Science and Technology	        <br><br>FULL & OPEN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DOMAIN<br>-Information Assurance <br>-Architecture Support<br>-Software	        <br><br>FULL & OPEN MEDICAL DOMAIN<br>-Drug Development Policies & Procedures<br>-Science, Pharmaceutical, Vaccine/Biologics Management<br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground - Natick Contracting Division, 13501 Ingenuity Drive, Ste 200, Orlando, FL 32826<br><br>Places of Performance:<br>For additional information, please reference the RFP W911QY-12-R-0004 PWS.<br><br>JPEO Headquarters<br>5103 Blackhawk Road, Building E5101<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground - Edgewood Area (APG-EA), MD 21010<br><br>JPM Office, Biological Defense<br>5184 Blackhawk Road, Building E3551<br>APG-EA, MD 21010<br><br>JPM Office, Chemical Biological Medical Systems<br>1564 Freedman Drive<br>Fort Detrick, MD 21072<br><br>JPM Offices, Contamination Avoidance and Guardian<br>5183 Blackhawk Road, Building E2800, Suite 301<br>APG-EA, MD 21010<br><br>JPM Office, Information Systems<br>4301 Pacific Highway, Building OT1, 2nd Floor<br>San Diego, CA 92110<br><br>JPM Offices, Medical Countermeasures and Protection<br>50 Tech Parkway, Suite 301<br>Stafford, VA 22556<br><br>Provisional JPM Radiological-Nuclear<br>5183 Blackhawk Road, Building E2800, Suite 118<br>APG-EA, MD 21010<br><br>JPM Office, Transformational Medical Technologies<br>8725 John J.

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science (DLS), intends to award a sole source purchase order to University of Maryland School of Public Health, 2242L School of Public Health Building, College Park, MD 20742 for the procurement of services of identification of all bacteria present in 3 separate lots of 15 brands of smokeless tobacco.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology). <br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to allow the University of Maryland, School of Public Health to extend their previous work in cigarette tobacco into smokeless tobacco, specifically to identify the bacteria present in 3 separate lots of 15 brands of smokeless tobacco and their effects related to the generation of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs). The University of Maryland, School of Public Health is the only responsible source capable of meeting the Government's requirement because they are the only entity that is currently using a state-of-the-art, high-throughput sequencing technology (454 pyrosequencing) to comprehensively catalogue the total bacterial metagenome (total bacterial diversity) of tobacco products. This technology generates tens of thousands of rRNA gene sequence reads per sample processed, allowing for unparalleled results regarding the identification of total bacterial communities present in tobacco products. No other laboratories are currently performing the following specific methods on tobacco products to evaluate total bacterial communities: total DNA extraction, DNA purification, 16S PCR, 454 pyrosequencing, a bioinformatics-based approach to manage, model and understand raw sequence reads from the 454, and novel statistical methods to compare results within and between products. Thus, the University of Maryland, School of Public Health, is the only company that can be used. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. However, firms that believe they can meet these requirements are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contracting Officer by May 19, 2012.<strong> The Contracting Officer will not respond to verbal request. All requests must be in writing. <br /></strong><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Vallerie Redd by email at gfj3@cdc.gov and reference solicitation number 2012-Q-14542 on the subject line.

<DESC>FTI Bridge Contract Announcement
Reference:  FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) Market Survey/Request for Information - Solicitation Number 10916 issued 14 July 2011
1. IntroductionThis public announcement is being issued in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.3.11.  Interested parties are advised that:  This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposals;  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals; and  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in responding to this announcement.
2.  Purpose of this AnnouncementThe purpose of this announcement is to advise interested parties that the FAA intends to issue a bridge contract to Harris Corporation for the continuation of services obtained under the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) contract. The bridge contract will have a five-year period of performance with an estimated value of $225 to $250 million per year.
3. BackgroundThe FTI contract has a period of performance from July 2002 to September 2017 and there is a Continuity of Services clause that could be invoked to extend the services to September 2018. In July 2011, the FAA issued a request for information (RFI) to obtain an industry forecast of telecommunications technologies and pricing between 2015 and 2025 and to assess the potential competitive landscape for the successor to the FTI contract. While the responses to the RFI indicated that there is sufficient interest in a re-competition of the FTI scope of services, it also showed that there are no marketplace or technology drivers at this point in time that would yield a positive business case or provide benefits beyond what can be obtained through the existing FTI contract.The lack of a favorable business case for award of a successor to the FTI contract in the near term and the FAA budget and NextGen-related constraints (described in Section 5 of this announcement) have led the FAA to conclude that it is in its best interests to issue a bridge contract to Harris Corporation on single source basis to continue the services obtained under the FTI contract for an additional five-years beyond 2017.  
4.  FTI Scope of ServicesThe FAA obtains approximately 25,000 telecommunications services under the FTI contract. Two physically separate networks are provided - one to support to National Airspace System (NAS) operations and one to support routine administrative and mission support functions. The FTI NAS operational network supports seven different availability levels with the highest being 0.9999971. FTI relies heavily upon commercial telecommunications infrastructure, but to meet the required availability levels, the FTI contractor provides dedicated nodal infrastructure at 4,000+ service delivery locations. The FTI contractor also provides security gateways that enable FAA stakeholders (internal and external) to obtain NAS operational data without jeopardizing the security of NAS operational systems. The FTI Mission Support network is a private Internet Protocol (IP) network that provides connectivity to approximately 1000 locations. The FTI Mission Support network has two levels of service - a premium level with 3-hour restoration and a standard level with next business day restoration. Large core sites are implemented with premium level service and the majority of the sites (> 90%) are implemented with the standard level of service. The FTI contractor also provides security tokens for virtual private network (VPN) access to the Mission Support network to more than 15,000 FAA employees and support contractors.In addition to traditional telecommunications services, the FTI contractor also provides enterprise messaging services based upon Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) technologies. The FTI enterprise messaging services provide a standardized and secure implementation of a publisher/subscriber model for efficient distribution of information.The nodal infrastructure comprising both the NAS operational network and the Mission Support network is the property of the FTI prime contractor and its service provider teammates. They are responsible for performing technology refreshes as required to ensure the continued supportability of the network. The FTI contractor is also the Customer of Record for all the access and transport circuits comprising the FTI network.The majority of FTI telecommunications services originate or terminate in the continental United States (CONUS), but the FTI contractor also provides services to FAA and stakeholder locations outside the CONUS (e.g., Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Guam, and international locations). FAA stakeholders include the Department of Defense (DoD), the National Weather Service (NWS), and foreign air traffic control entities such as NAVCANADA. Within the CONUS, FTI relies heavily upon an optical backbone that consists of 2.5 Gbps and 10 Gbps optical waves that connect major FTI network points of presence (POPs). FAA high-traffic volume facilities connect to the optical backbone via dual SONET rings (also referred to as "metro rings") or direct OC-level fiber connections.  In addition to traditional landline services, the FTI contractor provides satellite and microwave-based services as follows:  42 remote earth station sites in the CONUS providing 132 DS-0 services;  8 remote earth station sites in the Caribbean providing14 DS-0 services;  120 microwave radio sites in the CONUS supporting 164 DS-1 services; and  39 microwave radio sites in OCONUS locations (Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico,   the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam) supporting 77 DS-1 services.
Since award of the FTI contract in 2002, the FAA's service requirements have evolved from a mix of voice grade (VG) and low data rate digital circuits to much higher bandwidth trunks and services that utilize Internet Protocol (IP) interfaces. The FAA expects demand for bandwidth to continue to grow as it transitions to the Next Generation (NextGen) air traffic control system.The FTI contractor also provides an extensive set of "support services" that are integral to the operation of the FTI networks. The support services include, but are not limited to program management, network engineering, configuration management, service verification, service ordering and provisioning, network management and operations, and security management.
5. ConstraintsThe FAA is facing a tightly constrained funding environment due to the Government-wide budget climate. Over the next five fiscal years, the FAA has prioritized available funding to the ongoing implementation of the NextGen air traffic control system. As a result, capital investment funding will not be available to support the replacement of the FTI network until 2018 at the earliest. In addition, Operations funding will not be available to support the parallel operation of the existing FTI network and a replacement network during that same timeframe. The transition to a replacement network also would have to be achieved without disruption to ongoing NAS operations and without impacting the NextGen implementation.The FTI contractor and its service provider teammates own all of the network infrastructure supporting the delivery and operation of FTI telecommunications services. There is a clause within the FTI contract that allows for the transfer of infrastructure (referred to as "Customer Premise Equipment") located at FTI service delivery points with the terms and conditions subject to negotiation. In addition, the FTI contractor is the Customer of Record for all access and transport circuits, optical waves, and metro rings supporting the delivery of FTI services, but there is no contract clause requiring the transfer of those resources to the Government or a third party at the conclusion of the FTI contract.As part of managing its telecommunications enterprise, the FAA must ensure that contract end dates do not result in an interruption of services. Through the FTI program, the FAA has established an integrated infrastructure that supports the full range of the agency's telecommunications requirements. This approach has enabled the FAA to reduce the unit cost of telecommunications services through economies of scale and efficiency gains achieved through consolidating its management and acquisition of telecommunications services under the FTI contract. Moving forward, the FAA's intent is to preserve these efficiency gains and cost reductions. As such, the successor to the FTI contract must provide the full scope of services.  
6. FTI Bridge Contract Details and Planned ActionsBased upon the constraints noted above and the outcome of the 2011 Market Survey, the FAA plans to issue a single source bridge contract to the Harris Corporation to extend the services provided under the FTI contract. The period of performance will be five years (one base year and four one-year options) with an additional one-year continuity of operations period. The FAA intends to extend existing FTI contract clauses that place a cap on telecommunications service prices and incentivize continual optimization to maximize network efficiency. In addition to the single source bridge contract, the FAA's Communications, Information, and Network Programs organization that manages the FTI contract will seek to establish a capital investment funding line for a successor contract to FTI that will be awarded on full and open competitive basis prior to the end of the FTI Bridge contract period of performance. The expectation is that the continued evolution of telecommunications technologies and the FAA's migration to standard commercial interfaces through NextGen modernization programs will create a more favorable business case for the FTI network replacement.
7.  Industry FeedbackInterested parties are invited to provide feedback on this announcement and the FAA's planned course of action. The FAA is interested in whether there are any parties who feel they could provide a replacement to the FTI network within the constraints identified in Section 5 of this announcement. Responses to this announcement must be submitted via electronic mail (e-mail) to the following FAA Email address:  9-AJW-FTI2Info@faa.gov by the date below. Files must be compatible with MS Office 2010 or be in Adobe Acrobat PDF format. No other form of submission will be accepted.Submissions are due by 4:00 pm EDT on May 31, 2012. The FAA will provide acknowledgment of receipt to each respondent via e-mail. If there are any objections to the planned course of action, the FAA may elect to follow-up with individual respondents to assess the viability of any recommended alternative courses of action.(End of Announcement)

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to RuRo, Inc., 321 Ballenger Center Drive, Suite 102, Frederick, Maryland 21703 to procure LIMS 24/7 Software Platform.</p>
<p>Please see attachments: ISSO Security Language Requirements and 508 Compliance Language. Any modifications to the site will be 508 compliant.<br /><br />The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to the NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge.</p>
<p>The Contractor-Ruro, Inc., will provide the Undiagnosed Diseases Program with Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS 24/7), a software platform designed for the simplification and greater efficiency of laboratory sample, data and process management. This system will create a method of combining all bioinformatic processes that are used in the Undiagnosed Diseases Program for laboratory and clinical personnel to work collaboratively and efficiently. The multi-user nature of NIH's UDP Translational Laboratory, along with its dynamic process structures, engenders a deep set of requirements for any candidate data and project management system. The enterprise-grade LIMS 24/7 platform is a web-based system that encompasses project, task and asset management; user role configurability; user-tailored reporting; extensive audit functionality and information security. LIMS 24/7 is designed to be the meeting place of laboratory software tools, laboratory hardware, and staff users, allowing previously impossible levels of secure data access, communication and process efficiency. Ruro, Inc. is the only one that is able to port our existing databases into a unified database and maintain <strong>COMPATABILITY,</strong> therefore, Ruro, Inc. is the only source that can provide this system without disruption.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KEY FEATURES</span></strong>:<br /><br />&bull; Web-based: LIMS 24/7 is a Web-based Project and Data Management Solution that provides access to information locally or remotely.<br />&bull; Accelerated Implementation Method (AIM): A process involving online and onsite staff interviews to gather advanced specifications and "Sandbox" based system configuration by RURO engineers. LIMS 24/7's implementation method involves the end user in every step, ensuring the highest level of data model accuracy.<br />&bull; Complete Data Management: Store all asset information: hardware, consumables, patient, staff, knowledge, et all. Set and assign alerts; generate reports, charts and graphs; configure email notifications and more. Define tasks and assign to form complete processes, "mix and match" or update tasks as requirements and workflows change. Provide users with "checks" and guidance to ensure use of best methods in achieving processes.<br />&bull; Advanced Search and Data Mining: Query any field or combination of fields present in LIMS 24/7. Narrow the search down by adding range limits and other options.<br />&bull; Audit Trails: LIMS 24/7 keeps and displays audit trails for all significant and sensitive events, including those related to security and workflow.<br />&bull; Strict Administration: LIMS 24/7 provides role-based access to all information and administrator rights to modify program configuration. User groups further restrict which users can access certain projects, assets or specific fields within.<br />&bull; Security: Access to data stored in LIMS 24/7 is protected byusername/password and limited idle time sessions that virtually eliminate unauthorized activity. LIMS 24/7 is built on a world-class security platform.<br />&bull; Multi-Language Support: LIMS 24/7 has full unicode (UTF-8) support and can be used with all language and font styles.<br />&bull; Data Identification: Barcode label printing, scanning, and verification.Compatibility with RFID technology.<br />&bull; VM-Based: Installation, management, and upgrades with LIMS 24/7 Virtual Appliance. Pre-built, pre-configured, ready-to-run application packaged with an internal operating system eliminates installation, configuration, and maintenance costs associated with traditional<br />deployment methods.<br />&bull; Regulatory compliance: LIMS 24/7 was designed to work in a regulatory environment and enables compliance with regulations under FDA's 21CFR Part 11 for electronic documents and electronic signatures. Full support for HIPAA Regulations including HIPAA Accountability Act of 1996, HIPAA Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Patient Safety Act).<br />&bull; Data encryption using unbreakable 1024-bit technology and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) ensure that all data traffic between LIMS 24/7 web server and a browser remains private and secure.<br />&bull; LIMS 24/7 supports user authentication via Active Directory Domain<br />Services (LDAP protocol).<br />&bull; LIMS 24/7 comes with PostgreSQL server but can be setup to use any provided database: PostgreSQL, mySQL, IBM DB2, Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server.<br />&bull; Programming language-independent Application Programming Interface (API) is provided with LIMS 24/7 to create custom reports, tools, extensions, and additional modules to integrate with various instruments. Detailed documentation and examples provided.<br /><br />Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services and the Small Business Size Standard is $25.5M Per Annum. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-58 (April 18, 2012).</p>

<DESC>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) continues to have a need for storage, monitoring and distributing blood, urine, tissue and other samples collected currently by 53 NICHD research projects. The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics, and Prevention Research (NICHD) intends to negotiate, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253( c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1, a modification to its current contract no. HHSN275200900009C entitled "Repository for Storage, Monitoring, and Distribution of NICHD Biological Specimens." There are approximately 4 million vials of biological specimens that have been collected under various research protocols. Adequate storage space will be required for 1,000,000 vials stored at -20 degrees C; 2.6 million vials at -70 degrees C; 160,000 vials stored in Liquid Nitrogen (LN2); and 40,000 samples stored at ambient temperature. The collection currently occupies 13 LN2 freezers, 100 ultra-low freezers and 1 walk-in freezer at -20 degrees C. The following criteria define NICHD's need for the repository. Foremost and of paramount importance, Offerors must have the ability to assume responsibility and maintenance for the entire collection for one month (June 1, 2012-June 30, 2012) without jeopardizing the functionality of the repository and the validity and integrity of all specimens. Specifically, Offerors must have the capacity for the requisite storage space. All storage must be in one central building in order to facilitate daily activities. Building(s) must be equipped with adequate and appropriate monitoring equipment and back-up electrical power source(s). Awarding a new contract would result in unacceptable delays, substantial duplication of effort, and increased costs to the government. This is not a request for proposals. However, if any responsible source believes it can perform the above requirement, they may submit three (3) copies of their capability statement for consideration by the NICHD to: Lynn Salo, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, NIH, 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland 20852 by May 18, 2012, 3:00 PM local time. Phone number 301-435-6962 and fax 301-402-3676. All responses must be received in writing and must contain material in sufficient details to allow the NICHD to determine if the party can perform this requirement. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. This requirement is defined as code 541712 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

<DESC>A full-scope site Level 3 probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for a nuclear power plant site can provide valuable insights into the relative importance of various risk contributors by assessing accidents involving the reactor core as well as other site radiological sources (i.e., spent fuel pools, dry storage casks, and multiple units). These insights can be used to further enhance regulatory decision making and to help focus limited agency resources on issues most directly related to the agency's mission to protect public health and safety.
<p>Although Level 3 PRAs have since been performed to some extent within both the United States and international nuclear industries, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has not sponsored development of a Level 3 PRA for a nuclear power plant site since NUREG-1150. In the more than two decades that have passed since the NUREG-1150 Level 3 PRAs were performed, numerous technical advances have been made that were not reflected in the NUREG-1150 PRA models. The staff has also identified additional scope considerations not previously considered that could be addressed by performing a new full-scope site Level 3 PRA.</p>
<p>A Level 2 PRA model provides 1) a structured and comprehensive evaluation of containment performance in response to accident sequences identified from the Level 1 analysis and 2) a quantitative characterization of radiological release to the environment that would result from accident sequences that involve leakage from the containment pressure boundary. Deterministic T-H modeling and analyses serve as the basis for many of the assumptions used in the Level 2 as well as the Level 1 PRA logic models. As such, the T-H models and analyses must adequately represent those systems and phenomena that are being modeled so that the PRA logic model represents realistic plant response to various accident scenarios.</p>

Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS. <br /><br />c) Although &ldquo;proposal&rdquo; and &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; are used in this SSS, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br /><br />d) Background: <br /><br />1) The Combat Air Force&rsquo;s (CAF) Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) program conducts mission rehearsal at ACC, PACAF, and USAFE main operating bases for F-15C, F-15E, F-16 Block 40/50, F-22, A-10, RC-135, and AWACS platforms, with interoperability between sites provided via the DMO Network (DMON). The F-15E MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base and meet standards and connectivity to participate in DMO Events. Currently, this capability is provided through a commercial training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end in July 2016. The Air Force wishes to continue with a simulation services contract for the F-15E MTCs at no less than one (1) location and no more than four (4) locations that may include three (3) USAF CONUS bases and one (1) OCONUS base. Each F-15E site will connect into the DMON and will have to meet the CAF DMO Interoperability Standards (described at http://www.dmodmt.com). An Associate Contract Agreement with the network provider and other platform simulator manufacturers will be required in support of DMO integration. Contractors will be responsible for maintaining their simulation services concurrent with changes to aircraft and weapons operating at the respective locations. <br /><br />2) The Air Force does not own the simulator equipment or data used for the current contract and will not be providing simulator equipment or any other data for which the Government does not have Unlimited or Government Purpose Rights. The Air Force has unlimited rights to three of the Operation Flight Programs (OFPs) used on the aircraft, but there are a number of other software data and design documentation for which the Government does not have Unlimited or Government Purpose Rights. The F-15E MTC contractor will be required to obtain Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) with other vendors or develop their own technical/software data solution(s). The contractor will be required to provide the Air Force with a plan regarding their software development process and how they plan to obtain all the necessary data required to provide a concurrent MTC for training. <br /><br />e) The Government anticipates non-personal, non-commercial, IDIQ services contract with a total period of performance of one five year base and anywhere from zero to no more than five 1 year options. Preparatory service payments will not be made. Equipment costs will not be removed from the evaluation criteria. <br /><br />f) All services/devices will be housed in existing Government facilities with minimal infrastructure changes and utilized by personnel designated by the Government. Government, contract or Air Force instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons. <br /><br />g) The purpose of this SSS is to determine offeror interest in providing F-15E MTC simulation services to the Air Force. <br /><br />II. Program Requirements: <br /><br />a) The F-15E MTC System will be a high-fidelity immersive simulation system that facilitates F 15E personnel training. This will include aircrew training at all levels, ranging from individual events in a single-ship mode of operation to large-scale, theater specific, composite force combat mission training and rehearsal in a distributed mission operation training environment. <br /><br />b) The F-15E MTC will be an integrated set of hardware and software that will implement the performance requirements specified in a requirements document that this organization will provide in the request for proposal (RFP). The MTC will be required to support basic and advanced mission training, tactics development, theater exercise support in both local and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) environments, and possibly operational test and evaluation, for all active duty F 15E aircraft employment capabilities. <br /><br />c) Each F-15E MTC will include either two (2) or four (4) own-ships (one own-ship equals the front and back seat of the same aircraft), with a grand total of no more than 16 own-ships in service. Each MTC must be concurrent with the fielded aircraft baseline and capable of single-ship, local multi-ship, combat theater missions, and DMO training and mission operations. Each MTC will include computer generated force simulation, scenario generation capability, instructor operator stations, and brief/debrief systems. Specific performance requirements for all system elements will be defined in the requirements documents, but will be similar to the following requirements for the existing system: <br /><br />1) Cockpits. The simulator system cockpits must be a high-fidelity representation of the F-15E aircraft including: controls, displays, avionics, weapons, sensors, communications, and aerodynamic flight modeling representative of the front and back seat of the F-15E aircraft. The system shall provide realistic simulation of F-15E handling characteristics for all normal ground and flight regimes. The system must be able to accurately represent all aircraft and weapons malfunctions. The system must be equipped with a full field-of-view, high-fidelity visual display, digital image generation system for visual, night vision imaging system, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), radar data base, and EO/IR data base. The cockpits will be designed for networked training scenarios of one or more participants and in addition allow for stand-alone, solo aircrew training. Cockpit hardware and software will be modular and an open architecture design to allow for flexibility for upgrades and incorporation of new hardware/software technology. <br /><br />2) Synthetic Environment. The simulator will create a realistic, high fidelity environment capable of supporting a full range of mission scenarios. It will support a mix of constructive and interactive entities that react to aircraft flight maneuvers, avionics, weapons systems, and atmospheric conditions. It will accurately model physical, electronic, aerodynamic capabilities, and fly-out characteristics of real world threats. It will also accurately model and integrate the impact of aircraft countermeasures (i.e., chaff, flares, jamming, anti-radar maneuvers, etc.). It will realistically model electronic combat entities and their effects. Constructive entities will include blue, gray, and red air entities as well as ground based threats (i.e. air platforms, Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) sites, ground vehicles, ground sites, ground personnel, and maritime targets). Threats will operate under a realistic, dynamic command and control structure. The system will provide aerodynamic and visual simulation of aircraft battle damage. <br /><br />3) Instructor Operator Station (IOS). Each IOS will provide the instructor the ability to independently monitor the simulation and all displays of an own-ship, or a combination of selected displays from the four interconnected own-ships. The system will also provide the capability to set up and run one or more independent simultaneous missions. It will also include the ability to simultaneously operate local and long-haul network devices and monitor all missions. This system must be capable of managing a DMO mission environment. The IOS will be capable of controlling and inputting threats, Emergency Procedures (EPs), malfunctions, instrument indications, and weapons hit/miss data. The IOS must provide means for generation, setup, monitoring, and evaluating simulated training scenarios and missions. These scenarios can be changed or modified by the instructors at any time during the mission via the IOS. The capability to share scenarios and missions between networked sites must be provided. The IOS will give the instructor the capability to insert specific or dynamically created situations into the simulation. This includes EPs, threats, instrument indications, weapon hit/miss data, and other mission events. The IOS will be capable of freezing/resetting individual or all four cockpits scenarios independently. The IOS must be capable of restarting at the point of freeze, start of mission, or at a dynamic instructor-selected point in the mission. The IOS must also be able to set mark points and repeatedly reset to those points. The IOS needs to allow generation of additional scenarios of varying classification levels concurrently with flying a scenario. <br /><br />4) Visual Display System. The simulator system must include a state-of-the-art, high-fidelity digital image to present the aircrew with realistic, detailed, real-world imagery. This includes a fully correlated &ldquo;out-the-window&rdquo; visual display system supporting all aspects of complete mission training, including all cues necessary to support such training, as defined in ACC F-15E training syllabi and the Training Task List (TTL), to include night vision imaging systems. At a minimum, dynamic air model assessments (determination of range, closure, aspect angle, and visual identification) must support multi-ship tactical formations, Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), Air Combat Maneuvers (ACM), and Air Combat Tactics (ACT) cues. Also, the visual system must support various air-to-ground missions such as Surface Attack Tactics (SAT), Close Air Support (CAS), and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), with ground and maritime static and dynamic targets. The visual display (out-the-window and in the cockpit for radar and EO/IR weapons capabilities) will provide a high-fidelity image (contrast, brightness resolution, scene complexity, etc.) to the aircrew. <br /><br />5) Networking. The MTC must provide local area and wide area network capability and use the most current long-haul networking protocols. The systems will be capable of connecting to and being a full participant in the DMO environment for one, two, or more trainers and will be required to meet the CAF DMO standards. <br /><br />6) Briefing/Debriefing Facilities. The brief/debrief capability should be able to provide a &ldquo;God&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; view, selected own-ship or target views, and full battlefield observation (observation of the entire scenario, or a selectable major portion thereof). The system should include the ability to independently observe displays of an own-ship or a combination of selected displays from the four interconnected own-ships. The system must have the capability to record full mission data for replay. Brief, real-time observation, and debrief capabilities of this system must support all four own-ships simultaneously. The recordings should be both archivable on removable media and transferable to other sites over the network. Minimum recording time length of 120 minutes will be supported (a longer recording time is highly desired). The current brief/debrief system represents an example of the required capability. The brief/debrief capability should be able to provide &ldquo;before the mission&rdquo; planning or briefing mode, &ldquo;after the mission&rdquo; debrief capability, and &ldquo;real time&rdquo; observation capability to watch the mission as it unfolds. The before/after mission period modes require a video teleconferencing capability for all participating crews, at the appropriate classification levels. <br /><br />d) F-15E aircrews obtain over 20 percent of their overall training events through the MTC; therefore, ACC requires no break in training during the transition from the incumbent contractor. <br /><br />e) F-15E MTCs must be delivered and maintained in a fully operational status that remains concurrent with the home station aircraft configuration and that maintains the ability to be available for use at least 95 percent of the time. <br /><br />III: Directions Responding to this SSS. <br /><br />a) Offerors who responded to the Government&rsquo;s RFI released on 29 Jul 11 are asked to again respond to this SSS.

<DESC>The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) is planning to acquire engineering services for the Advanced Technology Support Program IV (ATSP4), which will be the next in a highly successful series of engineering services contracts. The purpose of this announcement is to provide notice for sources sought for an upcoming Source Selection for the ATSP4 requirement and to publicize the DMEA web site where additional information is available. ATSP4 is a uniform technical and management approach that leverages advanced technologies to meet the requirements of the Department of Defense (DoD) for a quick reaction capability across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This capability includes the development of appropriate solutions to keep a system operational, elevate sophistication level, or meet new threats. These efforts may include developing components to meet the DoD's requirements for ultra-low volumes, extending component availability, or ensuring a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics; also included will be the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements to DoD weapon systems in response to traditional and irregular (asymmetric) threats and to the problems related to aging weapon systems. Increasing warfighter capabilities and providing solutions to electronics support problems-such as, reliability, maintainability and obsolescence-are accomplished through the development and insertion of applications of advanced microelectronics technologies. The scope of ATSP4 covers both hardware and software and includes studies, analysis, design, software, simulation, prototyping, integration, testing, producibility, and limited production. The scope of ATSP4 also includes the development of viable methods and procedures for using available tools and resources, strategies for resolution of replacement alternatives, and technical interchange in support of task accomplishment.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Source Selection methodology will be utilized which anticipates multiple awards for this indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contract. Feedback received by DMEA will be used to help us shape the Request for Proposal (RFP). DMEA has established a web site located at: http://www.dmea.osd.mil/atsp4ss, where associated documentation has been posted. This site will utilize an interactive RFP approach where the solicitation will be refined through the analysis of industry comments and suggestions, which are encouraged. Posted information is non-binding and subject to change. In support of DoD paperless initiatives, all communications regarding this acquisition will be electronic.</p>
<p>An industry day is scheduled for this requirement. Please visit the above website for more information. The website will be updated as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>The Nanoelectronic Device Metrology (NEDM) Project in the Semiconductor and Dimensional Metrology Division at NIST, is developing the metrology that will help enable emerging nanoelectronic technologies to supplement and/or supplant conventional CMOS. As part of this effort, the NEDM is developing innovative measurement approaches to speed the search for new information processing devices (such as those based upon materials such as graphene) that show significant advantage over ultimate FETs in power, performance, density, and/or cost. The NEDM requires a cryogen-free superconducting magnet cryostat system capable of electrically characterizing novel device structures based upon two dimensional systems such as graphene in the presence of large magnetic fields. <br />The system will be used to characterize the electronic properties of novel nanoelectronics devices and component materials (such as graphene) that can be used in Post-CMOS electronics at large magnetic fields and from cryogenic temperatures to room temperature. The current, voltage, capacitance, and resistance will be measured as a function of magnetic field. By combining a relatively small magnetic field modulated at low frequencies with the large magnetic field applied by the superconducting magnet, very small changes in the resistance of the devices under test can be measured as a function of magnetic field with unparalleled sensitivity by using lock-in amplifier techniques.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a cryogen-free superconducting magnet cryostat system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.<br />NIST has a need for cryogen-free superconducting magnet cryostat system that would meet the following requirements:<br />1. CRYOGEN-FREE: System must be a closed-cycle, cryogen-free cryostat using a pulse tube refrigerator or equivalent cooling approach. System must not require the use of liquid helium or liquid nitrogen.<br />2. SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET: System must have the sample space within a superconducting magnet providing a 12 Tesla or larger magnetic field (14 T or larger preferred).<br />3. MODULATED MAGNETIC FIELD: NIST strongly prefers a system which can include the ability to apply a magnetic field modulated in time simultaneously to the application of the large magnetic field up to the maximum specified field of the larger superconducting magnet. 25 mT (250 Gauss) at 20 Hz is required. Larger fields and/or higher frequencies are preferred. Any response to this notice should address these potential capabilities in detail.<br />4. TEMPERATURE: The system must be able to cool and control the sample temperature from 300 K (or higher) down to 2 K (or lower). Temperature must be controllable to better than 25 mK at temperatures below 100 K and 50 mK or better at all higher temperatures.<br />5. COOLING TIME: Sample cool-down to base temperature, less than 1 hour. Magnet cool-down, less than 72 hours.<br />6. SAMPLE ROTATION: The system must be capable of rotating the sample in situ (i.e., while cold and under magnetic field) from perpendicular to the applied magnetic field to parallel to the magnetic field.<br />7. SAMPLE SIZE: The system must be capable of measuring pre-packaged samples that are 1 cm X 1 cm in size. Larger sample areas are preferred.<br />8. WIRING: The system requires 16 or more wires that will connect to the sample mount. A minimum of 8, but preferably all 16, of these wires will be individually shielded low-noise, low leakage cabling.<br />9. ELECTRONICS: The system will include all electronics including temperature controller, superconducting magnetic field power-supply and controller, and AC modulation coil power supply.<br />10. EASE OF USE: The system must be operable by one person from sample loading/unloading to full cool-down and operation.<br />11. UPGRADABLE: The system must be upgradeable in the future to achieve lower temperatures (such as by adding a He-3 insert or a dilution refrigerator insert).<br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice. <br />Companies that manufacture such cryogen-free cryostat systems are requested to email a detailed response describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The response should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2.

<DESC>Description:
<p>Sources Sought Notices (herein referred to as a Request for Information) are issued by the Department of State when performing market research to determine industry interest and capabilities. The Department of State is particularly interested in the capabilities of Small Businesses to perform the worldwide services. This is a Request for Information announcement only.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation or request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submission of this Request for Information nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>The Department of State reserves the right to terminate this request and change its requirements if needed. Responding to this Request for Information does not guarantee participation in future Department activities.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Department of State's, Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM), Global Information Technology (IT) Modernization (GITM) program provides classified and unclassified desktop and server information technology equipment worldwide to approximately 270 sites abroad and 31 domestic bureaus and offices, under a centrally managed program designed to support the Department's evolving business processes, and modernization of the IT infrastructure using a four year life-cycle (Note: GITM Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) monitors are on a six year modernization life cycle.)</p>
<p><br />This request for information falls under IRM's multi-pronged Vanguard acquisition strategy, which focuses on acquiring and aligning contractual IT services to the Department of State's evolving enterprise service delivery model. Under Vanguard, IRM will consolidate and replace a large number of task orders and contracts with fewer and better-aligned performance-based acquisitions that integrate functions and processes and deliver improved services and cost efficiencies. The Vanguard task orders will be/are linked by Associate Contractor Agreements that commit the respective awardees to work together in support of Department service, efficiency, and IT security objectives. Vanguard 2.2.3 is the Department's hardware supply chain and logistics management task order for the worldwide IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>GITM is seeking to determine industry interest and the capabilities of sources available to satisfy a requirement to expand the array of modernized IT equipment deployed by the GITM program, focusing on comprehensive supply chain management solutions (purchase, receive and integrate, deploy, install, and repair and return) as well as cabling infrastructure modernization for existing overseas locations. This Request for Information and the Vanguard 2.2.3 excludes design and engineering support services.</p>
<p>Program Objectives:</p>
<p>The overall objective is to acquire a supply chain management solution that will leverage industry standards and best practices to increase efficiency, optimize effectiveness, and establish common processes for managing IT supply chains across the enterprise. The ability to maximize operational capabilities and minimize lifecycle costs are fundamental goals.</p>
<p>Other specific objectives for the expanded GITM program include:</p>
<p>a. Rationalize and consolidate disparate equipment life-cycles in order to reduce cost of supply chain activities and decrease time from procurement to installation.</p>
<p>b. Establish common supply chain management processes for managing an array of IT equipment to be installed globally using a process driven business model in order to improve service delivery:</p>
<p>1. Purchase - provide procurement support under the direction of the government to include requirements forecasting, determination and tracking, and coordinating procurement execution and procurement award.</p>
<p>2. Receive and Integrate - receipt of equipment, warehousing, material management, quality control and integration. Ability to support warehouse operations in the Washington, DC metro area is required.</p>
<p><br />3. Deploy - provide logistical services to deploy equipment using best delivery options within DoS guidelines; management deployment of personnel to DoS sites for installation.</p>
<p>4. Install - provide installation services on a global basis to install systems and related services.</p>
<p>5. Repair and Return - support receipt, repair and return of defective or failed equipment.</p>
<p>Innovation and Department of State Intent:</p>
<p>Industry should demonstrate its capability to provide:</p>
<p>a. Innovations in the area of providing an integrated view of information driving both supply chain activities (including cost/service trade-offs), and the equipment life-cycle of the installed base.</p>
<p>b. Innovative solutions in the area of remote installations wherein the contractor provides a US based technical team responsible for system installation assistance/guidance to government IT staff located at an overseas post performing the physical installation of systems.</p>
<p>c. Innovative solutions in the area of design and installation of modernized cabling infrastructure (data, voice, video) at overseas posts with the goal of providing complete and reliable cabling.</p>
<p>d. Innovations in the area of performance based metrics to include suggested different metrics for deploying to countries/regions based on the level of infrastructure development, i.e., metrics for deployments to less developed regions of the world differ from metrics for more developed regions of the world.</p>
<p>e. The deployment methodology for workstations may change overtime to include direct shipment of overseas, unclassified workstations from the workstation vendor's location to overseas locations.</p>
<p>f. The level of effort for this work may change overtime due to the impact of virtual desktop deployment; a technology GITM will pursue.</p>
<p>g. Collaboration with others across the Department of State vendor community is required to accomplish the objectives including building supply chain activities on engineering and design requirements under Vanguard 2.2.1 Task Order focused on engineering, designing, securing, operating and maintaining the Department's critical enterprise-wide IT network infrastructure. Innovative ideas on transition activities to a comprehensive supply chain process model that will minimize disruption to current activities are sought. Note: Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), McLean, VA is the Vanguard 2.2.1 contractor.</p>
<p>Additional Background related to Requirements:</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement. The Government is seeking to identify qualified large and small business sources under 2007 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541990 (Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services). The small business size standard is $14 million.  This notice is for market research purposes only and IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. For market research purposes only small businesses should provide responses.<br><br>Some of the following requirments were previously posted under W912DY-12-R-0016, Sources Sought: Global Logistics and Other Support Services to DoD (GLOSS DoD).<br><br><br>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The objective of this Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) is for Contractors to provide Life Health and Safety (LHS) support at existing and any future U.S. Military bases and camps worldwide.  The contracts are anticipated to be awarded in 2013 with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods, for a total ordering period of at least five years during which to compete for task orders.  The programmatic value of all task orders awarded under all of the ID/IQ contracts is $450M.<br><br>Interested sources should respond to the questions presented within this announcement in order to facilitate the Government's market research efforts.  The Government will analyze all responses and determine if the pool of qualified and interested small business firms is significant enough for a total set-aside competition restricted to small businesses or for a partial set-aside competition restricted to small businesses.  If the determination is made that there are not enough qualified and/or interested small business firms to perform this requirement, the Government may solicit the acquisition as an unrestricted full and open competition.  The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to interested firms. <br><br><br>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: The primary focus of this effort is to provide corrective actions of life, health and safety hazards existing at U.S. occupied facilities worldwide and including US Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A).  As part of the overall objective of Life, Health, and Safety (LHS) support the contractor may be tasked to provide electrical inspection and repair, fire inspection, fire prevention training, other independent support services as needed at locations throughout the world. This training supports fire safety concepts, fire protection and alarm systems, building codes and National Fire Codes and Standards. The fire safety training also serves to ensure that potential electrical risks are reduced, which would decrease LHS hazards identified during the electrical inspections.  The requirement will also include generator inspections and power optimization recommendations for systems providing low voltage electrical power to inspected facilities.  <br><br>Contractors will be asked to provide their own logistical support for their employees.  As part of the overall logistical support requirements, the contractor may be required to establish and operate temporary base camps, provide camp/facility and convoy security, provide life support to other contractors utilizing base camp facilities and while complying with established safety guidelines and mandates.  Contractors will utilize existing logistical support provided by the U.S. Military as much as possible, but may be asked to become 100% independent of such support. A primary capability requirement is for contractors to provide logistical support for their own personnel and government civilians overseeing the task.<br> <br><br>3. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms should submit a document describing relevant demonstrated experience and qualifications via email Michael.D.Ashworth@usace.army.mil and Tonju.L.Butler@usace.army.mil no later than Friday, 18 May 2012, 1600 Central Time.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought notice is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the USCG. The U.S. Coast Guard is seeking information from any Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized manufacturers, distributors, or other equivalent potential sources for the purchase of new General Electric CT7-9C3 engines, P/N 6058T82G01CT7-9C3. These engines must be configured for installation on U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) HC-144A aircraft, including propeller gear box (PGB) P/N 5074T51G16 or 17 and HydroMechanical Unit (HMU) P/N 6068T72P25. This is the ONLY configuration allowable for installation on USCG HC-144A aircraft. These engines must be ready for installation (RFI) at the time of delivery. The USCG requires that distributors, or other potential sources be ASA-100 certified, or in compliance with other quality systems listed in FAA Advisory Circular 00-56A. . Only new items will be acceptable; reconditioned or used will NOT be acceptable. The USCG WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE DATA OR BLUEPRINT SPECIFICATIONS. The USCG will require necessary certifications including a FAA Form 8130-3 or EASA-1 Form.
<p>Background: The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG/CG) currently operates thirteen HC-144A aircraft each powered by two CT7-9C3 turboprop engines. The end state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets. The HC-144A aircraft is manufactured by EADS CASA based in Seville, Spain, the CT7-9C3 turboprop engines are manufactured by General Electric, Aviation Division (Cage Code 99207) based out of Lynn, MA, USA. The base CASA CN-235-300M provides the foundation for the USCG HC-144A aircraft and changes to base configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235-300M aircraft. The USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft and its CT7-9C3, turboprop engines, are operated differently from general aviation in support of such Coast Guard missions as: Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, Logistic Support, and Law Enforcement Missions. These missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and other components. The aircraft, the engines and their components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).<br /><br />Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), provide quality systems as requested above, and complete product details, brochures, etc., which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations and options. Also, state the approximate lead-time for acquiring your product. Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Additionally, provide a response on whether the product has or has not been qualified for use in any DOD or Federal Government Aircraft. The Government believes the applicable NAICS code is 336412.</p>
<p>Please reply to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC's and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POC's for civilian users for general usage of product questions.</p>
<p>After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the FBO. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to USCG, ALC, 1664 Weeksville Road, Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001, Attention: Tonya Bush MRS Product Line or e-mailed to Tonya.W.Bush@uscg.mil. TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Responses must be received no later than 14 May 2012 at 4:00 PM Eastern. Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the Government make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.</p>

The basis for restricting competition is additional locks are needed; locks must be compatible with existing system and be able to work with current software.  The current electronic lock system uses Stanley Solution's proprietary software for managing access and programming the electronic locks.

Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because:  A Sole Source cost-sharing award to the Student Conservation Association, Inc. (SCA) for an interpreter intern is required to prepare an interpretive program about recreational opportunities, safety, natural and cultural history and represent the Arctic, Kanuti and Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge at the Arctic Interagency Visitor Center.  SCA intern has previously provided these interpretation services under a cooperative agreement; the USFWS/SCA National Agreement expired, therefore we request this sole source award to maintain continuity of service with the exiting project.  Further, per the sole source justification, F12PS00034 submitted by USFWS/Region 9 to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) on  January 17, 2012: An Indefinite Delivery- Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract is proposed between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and The Student Conservation Association, Inc. to facilitate cooperation between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and The Student Conservation Association, Inc. (SCA) for the following student conservation programs:   Internships (Short and Long-Term); High School Conservation Crews; Conservation Corps; Career Discovery Internship Programs; Wilderness Internships; Trails Inventory Program; Tribal Internships; and Wilderness Fellows.  
The anticipated IDIQ award is May 2012; prior to the award of the IDIQ, the FWS is establishing stand alone Purchase Orders to support current requirements. 
No further actions were taken to locate other sources for this requirement, as an IDIQ was anticipated to be in place by May 2012; however, the IDIQ award date has been postponed.   For more information contact Millie Cortes at 907-786-3409 or millie_cortes@fws.gov.

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Seattle, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Second Genome Inc. The proposed work requires microbiome characterization of sablefish luminal contents by microbial profiling of metagenomic by phylogenetic chip analysis, bioinformatics evaluation, and output available as raw data and phylogenetic graphics.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Research Enhancement and Utilization Technologies Division (REUT).&nbsp;The proposed work requires most comprehensive &amp; sensitive analysis for known bacterial and archeal operational taxonomic units, which is currently the G3 PhyloChip assay. The delivery date will be December 31, 2012. <br /><br />The G3 PhyloChip contains more than 1.1 million probes for over 50,000 taxa. It contains multiple oligonucleotides for every known category ofprokaryotic organism for sensitive, robust detection across a wide dynamic range. The G3 PhyloChip has validated intensity-based quantification with a coefficient of variation &lt; 7%, and has been employed in multiple, peer-reviewed publications (e.g., Franz et al, 2012, doi: I O.l038/mi,201 2.23; He et al, 2012, doi: 10.l038/ismej.2011.99). Second Genome has the exclusive license for this technology.</p>

However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. All responsible sources expressing intent will be evaluated. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. This is a simplified acquisition with estimated value of less than $150,000.00.</p>

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories, a government-owned/contractor-operated entity, is seeking one or more business partners including but not limited to the application, development, and licensing of SpinDx<sup>TM</sup>. Sandia is seeking a company or companies to cooperatively develop and commercially license the technology described in this posting. Commercial licensees will have the opportunity to obtain a license to the intellectual properties for reasonable compensation. It is expected that the company/companies that work with Sandia to develop the SpinDx<sup>TM</sup> technology will incorporate it into a commercial product.<br /><br />Description of SpinDx<sup>TM</sup>: Sandia researchers have developed an innovative technique for conducting simultaneous multiplexed immunoassays and white blood cell counts from a single finger prick of whole blood with &lt; 15 minute total sample-to-answer time. The technique is based on sedimentation principles within a disposable microfluidic disk, in which all sample processing and detection is automated by centrifugal force. SpinDx<sup>TM</sup> is highly flexible enabling customized assay development and consolidated disk prototyping with rapid turnaround time.<br /><br />Differentiating Advantages of SpinDx<sup>TM</sup> are:<br />
<p>&bull; Multiplexed: Up to 64 parallel assays from a single sample <br />&bull; Speed: &lt;15 min sample-to answer <br />&bull; Minimally-invasive: &lt;20&mu;L sample input (i.e., finger puncture whole blood sample) <br />&bull; Disposable: Single-use disks pre-loaded with all reagents for off-the-shelf processing <br />&bull; Simple/robust: Based on well-established principles requiring unsophisticated instrumentation</p>
<p>Potential partners must provide Sandia information describing their ability to research, design, develop, distribute, and market the SpinDx<sup>TM</sup> technology.</p>
<p>To express interest in this opportunity, please respond by mail to Jill Micheau at Sandia National Laboratories, MS 9004, 7011 East Avenue, Livermore, CA 94550, email jmmiche@sandia.gov, phone: 925.294.3672. Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice. Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice. Include company and contact information as well as a description of how your company meets Sandia's criteria and could best contribute to the formation of a CRADA or license and subsequent commercialization of this technology.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">On November 19, 2001, the President and Congress enacted the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), P.L. 107-71, 115 Stat. 597, which established TSA as a new Federal agency. ATSA provides authority to the Administrator of TSA to carry out chapter 449 of Title 49 United States Code relating to civil aviation security, including responsibility for ordering the deployment of law enforcement personnel at each airport security passenger-screening location to ensure passenger safety and national security. <br /><br />Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &sect; 44903(c) and 49 C.F.R. Part 1542, each airport operator is required to establish an air transportation security program that provides a law enforcement presence and capability at the airport that is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers. This Agreement is part of the joint effort of TSA and the airport operator to deploy sufficient LEOs in support of passenger screening activities at the checkpoint to meet their dual responsibility to ensure the safety of passengers and to counter risks to transportation security.</p>

<p>L-514 CONTRACTOR PASSES<br />Procedures for contractors obtaining entry authority on Malmstrom AFB: Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB may be permitted providing the contractor follows the procedures set forth below and 341 SW Pamphlet 31-103 (available at Visitor Control Center) and meets the security standards including applicable background checks. Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB will be permitted to contractor personnel who obtain proper credentials and passes through one of the two main entry points (Commercial Gate on 2nd Ave North or 10th Ave North Gate). Retired military members and dependents of active duty or retired military members who are employed by your company may use their retired or dependent Armed Forces Identification Card to enter Malmstrom AFB; however, they must still obtain a contractor's pass through the Visitor's Center located outside of the Commercial gate. In the event of increased force protection conditions, retired military members and the dependents of active duty or retired military personnel without a contractor's pass, will be required to follow the security measures enacted under the respective force protection condition. Contractor's badges will be obtained in the following manner:<br />a. First, contractor employees must already have adequate identification such as a driver's license or company ID card. This identification should include, as a minimum, the physical description of the individual (i.e., height, weight, date of birth, eye and hair color), a picture of the individual, and the individual's signature.<br />b. Upon award of a contract, the contractor will be issued an Entry Authorization List (EAL) by the contract administrator in 341 CONS. The contractor will need to submit the required information for the EAL to the contract administrator in 341 CONS prior to contractor personnel coming to Malmstrom AFB.<br />c. Upon initial entrance to Malmstrom AFB, contractors' personnel shall obtain a contractor's pass from the Visitor's Center where the EAL will be filed. Contractor passes will be valid for the duration of the contract. The contractor will be required to resubmit a new EAL upon exercising option years, contract renewals or extensions, and adding or subtracting names to and from the EAL.<br />d. If contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB for time(s) outside of the performance period of the contract (i.e., administrative issues, warranty issues, site visits), they will need to be vouched on by the customer, or supporting agency, of the respective contract they are associated with.<br />e. At the time contractors initially come to the Visitor's Center to obtain their pass, they will be required to fill out DD Form 1172, which the Visitor's Center will issue and maintain.<br />f. It will be the sole responsibility of the contractor to renew, remove, and add employees to the EAL. In order to renew, remove or add names to the EAL the contractor must follow the same processes as if they were submitting the EAL for the first time.<br />g. For existing contracts that are already in progress, contractors will follow the procedures mentioned above if any person(s) need a new or updated pass.<br />h. Any other instances where contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in which the customer, or supporting agency, will need to sponsor contractor personnel entry and accompany them while on base.<br />i. All passes must be returned to 341 SFS (Visitor Center) upon completion of the contract, or personal no longer require access to the installation, under performance of this contract.<br />j. Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or logo, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base. If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB. This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section. Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration. You or your representative will be required to certify in writing that your firm carries insurance on your vehicle or vehicles as outlined below:</p>
<p>i. $10,000 Property Damage Liability.<br />ii. $25,000 Personal Liability for each person.<br />iii. $50,000 Personal Liability for each accident.</p>
<p>(Note:) Each vehicle must be insured for the above limits if not already covered in your contract.</p>
<p>WAGE DETERMINATION<br />Due to the number of employees required for this acquisition and the classification of worker to be employed, no wage determination is being issued for this acquisition. Therefore, this requirement falls within the guidelines of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>
<p><br />WAWF INSTRUCTIONS <br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship to Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>
<p>*LPO DoDAACs are used for Navy contracts only.</p>
<p>(End of clause)<br />(xiv) DPAS Rating does not apply to this acquisition.</p>

<p>The Library faces many challenges with acquiring, managing, storing, preserving and making available audiovisual content. The Packard Campus (PCAVC) Film Preservation Laboratory's datacine operations unit must be a state of the art design in order to respond to increasing emphasis on digital preservation plus providing fulfillment orders per client requests. The PCAVC requires its professional staff to utilize a wide range of expertise, knowledge, and vision regarding the technical equipment, precise preservation techniques, media, and its associated failure mechanisms. These experts are required to utilize state-of-the art cutting edge technologies to apply preservation techniques to fragile, obsolete, and legacy moving image materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Thomson Spirit 2K Datacine originally installed and operating in the Madison building has been relocated and integrated into the PCAVC, Culpeper. The previous annual contract providing maintenance, technical support, and repairs was previously handled under the integration contract provided by the installer CEI, Inc. This contract has now expired, but the requirement for an ongoing full maintenance contract still exists. The Library does not have the in-house technical capability to provide this maintenance support without the expertise, and technical resources (spare parts, etc.), that can only be provided by the original equipment manufacturer, now known as Digital Film Technology (DFT). This support is essential to the on-going efficient operation of this highly sophisticated system. Requirements of the Maintenance Contract:</p>
<p>The Library wishes to continue with a premium level maintenance and service contract with DFT inc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>********************************************************************<br />PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED SOLICITATION FOR COMPLETE DESCRIPTIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS.<br />********************************************************************<br />The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS), Library of Congress, administers a free library service to eligible residents of the United States and American citizens living abroad who cannot hold, handle, or read standard print media because of a temporary or permanent visual or physical limitation.</p>
<p>Using federal funds, NLS annually publishes approximately two thousand books and seventy magazines in audio and Braille formats. Titles are selected to appeal to a wide variety of interests. Books and magazines are narrated and duplicated to a high professional standard. The number of copies produced of any title is dependent on anticipated reader demand.</p>
<p>Playback machines and their accessories are designed to facilitate convenient use by blind and physically handicapped people, provide maximum reliability under environmental conditions that are sometimes harsh, and survive handling that may be technically unsophisticated or inadvertently abusive. The equipment plays program materials in a special format compatible with NLS machines.</p>
<p>The contractor shall design, build, test and operate all required systems, hardware and software to:</p>
<p>1. Copy one or more Digital Talking Book Magazines, in the form of computer files, onto Government furnished USB flash-memory cartridges.</p>
<p>2. Label each USB cartridge, identifying it as a magazine cartridge for the particular week (All cartridges duplicated in that week will be labeled identically).</p>
<p>3. Package the cartridge in a Government furnished plastic container, print and apply an address card and mail the container (under the "Free Matter for the Blind" provisions of the USPS regulations).</p>
<p>4. Receive and refurbish cartridges and containers returned from patrons after use.</p>
<p>5. Record either the USB cartridge barcode or electronic serial number for all cartridges sent to and received from patrons. This data will be supplied via the Internet to NLS/BPH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Offerors to this solicitation must be able to demonstrate the capability to:</p>
<p>&bull; Design and implement hardware and processes to copy data files onto USB flash-memory drives.</p>
<p>&bull; Build, maintain and operate systems capable of writing, labeling, packaging and refurbishing between 8,000 to 15,000 cartridges per week.</p>
<p>&bull; Design, implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance processes to ensure products delivered under this contract meet or exceed NLS specifications.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide warranty repair/replacement service for cartridges not produced or for cartridges incorrectly produced or addressed.</p>
<p><br />Offerors who consider submission of a proposal should be cognizant of the consumer responsive nature of the program, and that the specifications for these products have been developed to meet the special needs of readers in the program. Materials are produced with those needs foremost in mind and improved through constant monitoring and consumer input. Contractors are expected to familiarize themselves with the equipment handling practices of blind and physically handicapped clientele and ensure that the equipment they produce will stand up under this type of use. A high degree of quality workmanship and product reliability is mandated by the product specification.</p>

<DESC>A proposal is requested for the installation and operation on the contractor's computer of Comprehensive Mailing List System (CMLS) and Batch Oriented BPH Inventory Control System (BPHICS) and the web-based online data entry and research application (NLS WebNet). Requirements includes document processing, data entry maintenance of the CMLS and BPHICS databases, support of existing software, ongoing development, hotline technical support, and administrative and project management duties. Existing sets of programs will be provided. <br /><br />The current systems, CMLS, BPHICS, and NLS WebNet operate on two contractor-owned IBM systems running under the Z/OS operating system. Should a contractor propose hardware or software conversion, all new software, source code and programs, will be the property of NLS/BPH and must remain easily portable to other hardware. The contractor shall adapt the programs to its computer (in ways which would not inhibit future use of these programs on other hardware). Initially, all new software must operate in a manner functionally equivalent to the existing system using the existing formats for reporting and data exchange.

Failure to include the certifications along with the price proposal or to complete the certifications on the internet may result in elimination from consideration for award.</p>
<p>FAR 13.106-2 Evaluation of Quotations or Offers:<br />The Government intends to award one purchase order as a result of this Request for Quote. Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated. Award will be based on the total overall lowest price quoted which meets or exceeds the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors. The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: Factor 1 - Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government's requirement and Factor 2 - Past Performance. Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a "go/no go" basis. If a quote has been determined to be a "go" on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror's past performance history is satisfactory. An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government's requirement<br />The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submittal of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the Statement of Work (SOW) and Drawing. Descriptive Literature means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings, brochures) that is submitted as a part of a proposal. Descriptive Literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the products offered that are specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design; (2) materials; (3) components; (4) performance characteristics; and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation. The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered products. It does not include other information such as that used in determining the responsibility of a prospective contractor or for operating or maintaining equipment. Descriptive Literature, required elsewhere in this solicitation, must be (1) identified to show the item(s) of the offer to which it applies and (2) received by the time specified in this solicitation for receipt of offers. The failure of descriptive literature to show that the products offered conform to the requirements of this solicitation may result in rejection of the offer.<br /><br />Factor 2 - Past Performance<br />By past performance, the Government means the offeror's record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance. The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries. Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submittal by the offerors of past performance information from three (3) sources that clearly indicate they have satisfactorily supplied and installed the same or similar audio/video equipment commercially or for the Government within the past three (3) years. This information shall include the following:<br />a. Contract Number<br />b. Point of Contact<br />c. Telephone Number<br />d. Dollar Amount of Contract<br />e. Brief description of type of equipment supplied and installed</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BITTERROOT NATIONAL FOREST<br />Stevensville Ranger District<br />Trail Packing Services</strong></p>
<p><br />This is a combined Synopsis solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation, AG-03R6-S-12-0029, is being issued as a request for quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-56.</p>
<p>This acquisition is a total small business set aside. The NAICS code associated with this acquisition is 713990 and the small business $7.0 million.</p>
<p><strong>***See attached "Schedule of Items"***<br />Packing Services for 10 Pack Trips</strong></p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Specifications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scope of Contract </strong></p>
<p>The Federal Government has a requirement for a Performance-based Service Contract for the USDA Forest Service, Bitterroot National Forest. Performance-based means the Contractor is responsible for an end product. If an end product is not provided in compliance with the contract specifications, an adjustment to the payment will be made.</p>
<p>The Performance-based Statement of Work shall consist of completing the ordered tasks to the acceptable quality level as defined by the scope of the contract. The awarded contract shall constitute the entire agreement including all terms and conditions applicable to the contract.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide all expertise, labor, supervision, services, equipment, mobilization, tools, supplies (i.e.; water, etc.), permits, licenses, transportation, and incidentals necessary to provide pack string support for trail crew projects on the Bitterroot National Forest (BRF) for the year 2012. For the most part "the crew" will be a Montana Conservation Corps (MCC) crew. The contractor will pack cargo, tools and food along system trails to campsites and later out to the trailheads using horses and/or mules. Trail crew members will hike in and out. There are 10 scheduled packing dates---packing in constitutes one packing day and the return trip constitutes one packing day. The exact packing dates can change slightly depending on trail conditions but the intent is to stick to the schedule. The performance period will be June 15 to September 30, 2012. Payment will be made for the actual number of days packed each month. The Contractor will provide the packer, a riding animal, four head (at minimum) of pack stock, transportation of all stock, and incidentals such as tack, saddles, manties, ropes, etc.</p>
<p>Many trailheads do not have a stock ramp, or the stock ramp may be blocked by an improperly parked vehicle. The packer must be able to load and unload animals without the aid of stock ramp.</p>
<p>Pack animals must be of acceptable quality, in sound fit condition with only minor cuts and wounds upon initial inspection by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR). An example of unacceptable quality includes but is not limited to any of the following: open, unattended sores, missing shoes with damaged feet, and lameness. Any animal deemed not fit for packing by the government will be checked and documented by a veterinarian at the contractor's expense. The contractor must also be able to provide a brand inspection and interstate transport permits for inspection at the trail head if needed.</p>
<p>The scheduled packing dates may vary slightly by project for various reasons. Packing in may be delayed by the need to clear the trail enough for a pack string or may be delayed for very bad weather. Packing out early may be called for if the project is completed early. The trail crew works on a scheduled work tour with fixed dates so the pack in and pack out dates could vary slightly. The intent is to adhere to the scheduled dates. Any adjustment to a scheduled packing date will be initiated when the COR calls the contractor at an agreed to phone number more than 24 hours in advance. When packing in, the trail crew will have gear and tools ready for packing at the trailhead by 10 AM. The packer will have the gear and tools delivered to camp by 5 PM. When packing out, the trail crew will have gear and tools ready for packing at camp by 8 AM. Some tools may need to be loaded along the trail on the way out. The packer will have the gear and tools delivered to the trailhead by 3 PM.</p>
<p>The packer is not expected to pack more than 100 pounds per side - gross pack weight. Most packs will range from 70-80 pounds. The packer can choose to pack more than 100 pounds per side on any given animal but no provision will be made for extra payment. The contractor will pack duffel, food boxes and backpacks in manties, panniers, or pack boxes to help protect the cargo from abrasion and rain. The trail crew will weigh the cargo and tools to make sure that the packer can pack conventionally sized loads and get by with 4 head of stock. The packer is responsible for making the packs, balancing the loads, loading and unloading the pack animals. If excess cargo is expected for a trip the COR will call the contractor a minimum of 24 hours in advance of the scheduled pack date to make sure the extra pack animals are available for that day.</p>
<p>The packer is expected to have experience and skill in safely packing tools to including but not limited to: 6' cross cut saws, chain saws, "pionjars" (90 lb gas powered jackhammers), rigging gear (griphoist, wire rope, blocks, slings, etc.) fuel, 5' rock bars, loppers, peaveys, pulaskis etc. Sharp tools will be already sheathed but the packer will supply what is needed to lash the tools on or otherwise safely contain the tools being packed. Crosscut saws will not be bent tighter than "U" shape when tied for packing. At the request of the trail crew the packer will unload the tools before reaching camp. Upon delivery at work sites and unload sites, cargo shall be delivered with only normal wear and tear or minor damage. Damage or injury to the stock or packer should be minimized to only minor bumps, cuts, or scraps not requiring vet or doctor care. Incidents causing property damage or injury will prompt a follow-up by the government to discuss with the contractor. Incidents will be evaluated on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>Hazards along the trail include but are not limited to rocks, holes, exposed roots, downed trees, leaning trees, brush, dayhikers, backpackers, bees and dogs. The trail crew may camp beyond where the trail needs improvement. The trail will be improved enough for the pack string to get by. The pack string may have to step over logs, negotiate uneven trail tread or leave the trail for short detours. Final responsibility for successful packing rests with the packer. Although there can be no guarantee that food, tools, camp gear will be delivered undamaged, the packer will demonstrate reasonable care and skill in packing. The packer will also make efforts to ensure public and crew safety during the trip.</p>
<p>In order to stay within the BRF's weed free practices guidelines and prevent noxious weed spread, all animals should be brushed and have their hooves picked clean of mud prior to being transported to the trailhead. All saddle blankets and tack should be clean and free of any weed seeds prior to transport to the load site. Vehicle undercarriages, bumpers, and wheels should have mud and weed seeds removed prior to entering the BRF. All animal feed must be designated as weed free, and the contractor must be able to show certification that the feed is considered weed free. If trailhead camping is required prior approval through the BRF must be received, and parties must agree to the standards of leave no trace behind camping policies. Any non-standard camping practices will be followed up on by the COR and cross referenced by any quality control notes made by the contractor.</p>
<p>The contractor must be able to show that they will be able to provide a reliable form of communication between the contractor and the COR, and be able to verify that messages have been received. The contractor must be able to contact the COR in the event that the packer will be late or miss the packing date.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included and FAR part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
(ii)	This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-58. 
(iii)	This solicitation is a total small business set-aside, NAICS 424520, Goat Merchants and Wholesalers, with a small business size standard of 100 employees.  The National Park Service encourages the participation of small, disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses. 
(iv)	The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price purchase order to the responsible offeror whose total offer represents the best value for the Government.   The National Park Service, Gateway National Recreation Area, Staten Island Unit is looking for a Goat Herd needed to perform vegetation management on historic landscape and structures.  This preservation method was selected due to the ability to perform the needed vegetation removal with the least disturbance to historic resources.

ProjectClear existing vegetation from the following areas of Fort Wadsworth using grazing goats: 1) Battery Duane, 2) the slope that extends from the Overlook to Weed Road, and 3) the top tier of Battery Weed.Optional areas may be added as needed.  A decision about additional areas will be made by mutual consent prior to the start of the project each year.Period of Performance
This contract will cover one base year, 2012, plus a possible four additional one year options.The initial period of performance will be from June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2013.  Subsequent option years will be from June 1 through May 31 of the following year.

DescriptionVendor will provide a herd of 21 adult goats, or equivalent, that are appropriate in temperament to working in an urban park setting. The herd will be divided into four (4) work groups to clear the three areas of existing vegetation. Planned areas for coverage include but are not limited to:
Battery Duane is an historic gun battery of stone construction. A fence will be placed around this battery to form approximately a 72,000 square foot area where the goats will graze and take shelter under existing trees.The Overlook slope. The first year only a small area will be used as a test to gauge effectiveness and to monitor any soil erosion. The herd will graze in a single area near the Overlook and take shelter under existing trees.
Battery Weed is an historic gun battery of stone construction. The goats (approximately 3) will graze on the top tier of the four-tier battery without the aid of a fence. The structure will provide a sheltered area. It is anticipated that this area will clear in a few weeks allowing these goats to then join the Overlook herd for the duration of the project. 
Fort Tompkins is an historic fort of stone construction with earthen roof that is filled with vegetation. The east and west sides provide the largest grazing areas.

<p>Statement of Work<br />Assessment Center (AC) Assessor<br />Custom and Open Enrollment Senior Executive Assessment Program (COE SEAP) Program<br />June 11-15, 2-12 &amp; October 1-5, 2012</p>
<p>I. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to select ASSESSORs to observe participants in a behavioral assessment center for the purpose of providing developmental feedback on their readiness and capabilities to be successful at their current position in the Federal Government. The assessment center (AC) is held as part of the Senior Executive Assessment Program (SEAP) within OPM's Leadership &amp; Human Resources Development Solutions (LHRDS) line-of-business and delivered in Tysons Corner, VA. SEAP is a 3-day assessment program.</p>
<p>II. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The Assessor works as part of a three-person team capturing behavioral data on up to six SEAP participants. Assessor duties include recording behavioral observations on assigned participants, coding observations to behavioral competencies including typing behavioral data onto templates, participating in consensus sessions with their Assessor team to determine competency strength or weakness for the pre-determined competencies assessed, developing a written report for the participant, and conducting a 90-120 minute debrief with each assigned participant on their AC assessment. One of the three Assessors on a team will be designated as a "lead" assessor and will have additional administrative responsibilities during the assessment and consensus days.</p>
<p>The Assessor must be highly experienced with the observation of leadership behavior exhibited by federal executives, while also possessing exceptionally strong people skills. The Assessor sets the tone for a comfortable, confidential and non-threatening assessment center and debriefing experience. The Assessor must genuinely enjoy interacting with a participant, be empathetic to their concerns, maintain confidentiality and privacy of any personal information, and be passionate about helping participants best prepare for an executive level position.</p>
<p>The typical AC Assessor day is 14-16 hours. The AC Assessor will arrive at least 10 minutes prior to the start of the AC process each day.</p>
<p>III. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>The AC runs over a 2.5 day period of time with a full day of participant assessment, a full day of consensus rankings by Assessors, and a half day of debrief delivery. The AC runs from 7am-6 pm on days 1 &amp; 2, and from 7am - 1pm on Day 3. Note on Days 1 &amp; 2 the AC Assessors typically spend 3-6 hours at night: 1) On day 1 this is for coding behaviors to competencies and typing that information onto pre-set templates; 2) on Day 2 this is to prepare two written reports on AC performance. OPM reserves the right to cancel any of these scheduled offerings. Actual travel expenses will be reimbursed. <br />OPM reserves the right to cancel any of these scheduled offerings.</p>

<DESC><p>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION <br />Subject: Veterinary Pharmaceutical, Dental and Medical Supplies <br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HHS 12-100-SOL-00020 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This procurement is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-57. This RFQ is issued on an unrestricted basis under NAICS code 423450. The size standard of 100 employees. THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.</p>
<p>Background<br />ASPR provides emergency medical care to the victims of public health emergencies and catastrophic events that overwhelm the capacity of state and local emergency medical systems to respond to these disasters. ASPR currently has teams located across the nation that are prepared to deploy within hours to respond to an all hazards environment. ASPR has positioned pharmaceutical caches/kits at various locations around the Continental United States, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. These caches/kits of pharmaceuticals must be in a constant state of readiness for immediate use to meet operational requirements. Medical caches for National Veterinarian Response Teams are located within the warehouses of ASPR. <br />Purpose<br />The purpose of this contract is to establish contract terms between The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/ASPR/OPEO and the Contractor. ASPR requires a wide variety of pharmaceuticals that are purchased then subsequently packaged into pre-configured caches/kits that are maintained by ASPR staff in preparation for a disaster. During a disaster, ASPR requires additional pharmaceuticals, dental and medical supplies for purposes of re-supplying caches/kits. The exact pharmaceutical, dental, or medical supplies, quantities and delivery requirements are not known in advance and may vary considerably for re-supply. The resulting contract provides for preparedness operations field re-supply of pharmaceuticals, dental, and medical supplies in the disaster-affected regions.<br />The resulting contract between Contractor and ASPR allows for one-stop shopping at pricing that allows for best value to the government, immediate shipping as required, and for system familiarity among USG credit card holders. The resulting veterinary pharmaceutical and medical supply, dental and medical supply acquisition contracts will be for two distinct operational conditions: one contract for preparedness and another contract for disaster response. The resulting contracts for pharmaceutical, dental, and medical supply services will allow for increased purchasing power and simplified purchase orders below the acquisition threshold.</p>

<p>When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 623110 with the small business size standard of $13.5 million.  
The Sioux Falls VA Health Care System Under Statutory Authority 41 USC 253 (c)(5) and 38 U.S.C. 1720 the Government anticipates entering into acquisition negotiations and award of a Basic Ordering Agreement for placement and services of eligible veterans into a nursing home facility located in Ipswich, South Dakota, for a Base Year period 06/1/2012  5/31/2013 with four (4) Option Years.  This authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Governments minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available in this location. The nursing facility shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients. Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.

STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patients condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veterans care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following: Admission identification record; VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care or State-approved referral form; Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician; Physician orders; Progress notes; the physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen; special reports (laboratory, x ray, activity, etc.; SMA Patient Assessment Form (only if SMA level of care is used); and Minimum Data Set (MDS) information, provided to VA upon admission and every six months thereafter.
15.  The beneficiary will be provided nursing home care at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the nursing care and treatment plan received from VA unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.
16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for 15 calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  Level of Care Classification Effective Records: VA will contract for 50 categories of care under Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV).  The level of care classification and associated per diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: (a) The recipient is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new admission assessment, (b)The nursing homes Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be completed at customary times during a patients stay, dependent on projection for short term or long term residence, and adhering to the most current MDS frequency guidelines from Medicare MDS or BRA or MPAF.  The applicable per diem rate will continue until the next assessment. In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VAs request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.  Based on these findings, VA retains the right to remove the automatic applicability of the nursing home generated MDS assessment for payment purposes, and (c) Therapy Requirements  All therapy provided under this contract will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  NOTE: Prior to starting a therapy program, facility must obtain VA pre-authorization.
18.  The VA, at its sole option, will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this agreement, through one or any combination of the following methods; reviews of state agencies reports, on-site inspection of the Nursing Home by VA staff, and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients.  It is agreed that the Nursing Home shall provide VA with copies of all state agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VAs quality improvement-quality assurance program functions relating to this agreement, including VAs on-site inspection and monitoring.   The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the contractors reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.
SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: (1) TERMINATION OF SERVICES:  VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the nursing home at any time, when it is determined to be in the best interest of the VA or the patients, without additional costs to the Government (2) EXTENSION OF AGREEMENT:  This agreement may be extended for four (4) one year periods at the option of the Government in accordance with 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  Notice of an extension must be served in writing by the Government thirty days prior to the scheduled expiration date.  The extension is granted subject to the availability of funds, (3) MINIMUM QUANTITIES:  It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this agreement.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this agreement, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the nursing home as outlined in this agreement.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the facility but not the day the recipient leaves a facility unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one day, (4) LIFE SAFETY CODE CLAUSE:  The administrator of your facility is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer at least 3 days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility, which were in existence at the time this contract was issued.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Fire Safety Officer responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of your facility and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval/disapproval of your facility to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes.

The assigned nursing home physician is the primary doctor during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the community nursing home.  The community nursing home physician is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Physician visits will be according to medical assistance guidelines.  The assigned nursing home physician will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care, easy access to staff for consultation, provide timely response to calls and arrange for timely physician back-up according to OBRA guidelines (Ref. 42 CFR 483.40 OBRA Guidelines), (6) In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident; advance directives/living wills shall be considered according to nursing home doctors orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian, or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VAMC is contacted by the private hospital physician within 72 hours of admission.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care, (7) VA MEDICAL CENTER CONSULTATION/RESOURCES: (a)  Telephone Care Communications System (TCCS):  For urgent-same day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 605-336-3230 x6181 between 9AM and 3PM Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same day appointment is anticipated, please call as early as possible, (b) Admissions System phone number 605-336-3230.  For non-emergency consultation/evaluation for admission to the VA Medical Center (after initial evaluation/intervention by the nursing home physician), (8) Ancillary Services/Supplies:  Any additional cost to the all-inclusive contract must be preapproved according to the following terms: (a) Medications/supplies will be billed/paid according to generic average wholesale pricing guidelines; monthly invoices verifying cost must be submitted for payment of any additional approved rates. Discharge Medications  on the day of discharge, the facility will dispense medications for a 14 day supply to the veteran and facility can bill to the VA at the AWP, and  (b)  Billing:  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) will not be billed for uncovered services/costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double billing and Federal fraud, (9) The VAMC will pay two-day bed hold for therapeutic passes or re-hospitalization; for longer periods the family must make arrangements with the contract facility to hold a bed.

Solicitation VA-263-12-Q-0556 is being issued as an unrestricted Request for Quotation (RFQ) and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-57. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 623110 with the small business size standard of $13.5 million.  
The Sioux Falls VA Health Care System Under Statutory Authority 41 USC 253 (c)(5) and 38 U.S.C. 1720 the Government anticipates entering into acquisition negotiations and award of a Basic Ordering Agreement for placement and services of eligible veterans into a nursing home facility located in Pierre, South Dakota, for a Base Year period 06/1/2012  5/31/2013 with four (4) Option Years.  This authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Governments minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available in this location. The nursing facility shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients. Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.  Facility must have and maintain the South Dakota Department of Health Nursing Facility License.
STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patients condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veterans care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following: Admission identification record; VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care or State-approved referral form; Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician; Physician orders; Progress notes; the physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen; special reports (laboratory, x ray, activity, etc.; SMA Patient Assessment Form (only if SMA level of care is used); and Minimum Data Set (MDS) information, provided to VA upon admission and every six months thereafter.
15.  The beneficiary will be provided nursing home care at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the nursing care and treatment plan received from VA unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.
16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for 15 calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  Level of Care Classification Effective Records: VA will contract for 50 categories of care under Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV).

The applicable per diem rate will continue until the next assessment. In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VAs request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.  Based on these findings, VA retains the right to remove the automatic applicability of the nursing home generated MDS assessment for payment purposes, and (c) Therapy Requirements  All therapy provided under this contract will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  NOTE: Prior to starting a therapy program, facility must obtain VA pre-authorization.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester shall file a formal agency protest to both the contracting officer and the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>1.0 BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The USCG operates thirteen HC-144A (CN-235, series CG01 or 300M) aircraft manufactured by Airbus Military (formerly EADS CASA), Seville, Spain. The base CASA CN235M aircraft provides the foundation for the HC-144A, changes to base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in the 300M series CG01 version of the CN235M, the USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft. These aircraft became operational in 2008, undergo Programmed Depot Maintenance Inspection (PDM) every four (4) years, and will require external paint refurbishment for the Coast Guard's fleet of HC144 aircraft. The USCG mission exposes these aircraft to harsh salt water environments. This Statement of Objectives (SOO) establishes the minimum requirements. <br />2.0 OBJECTIVE:<br />2.1 The USCG's objective is to obtain the services and establish a Firm Fixed Price Contract with a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized aircraft center with an onsite strip and paint facility and the capabilities and equipment to perform minor aircraft maintenance as described in paragraph 7.0.<br />2.2 The contractor shall provide all services necessary to prepare, scuff sand or strip coatings, and externally paint the HC-144 aircraft in accordance with (IAW) ALC's HC-144 Paint drawings 1100-11-1 (Paint and Detail Paint Drawing) and 1100-11-2 (Exterior Placards and Markings), Government published standards, CN-235 technical orders applicable to the CN-235 Model 300M Series CG01 version, and associated maintenance requirements listed in this SOO. Best commercial practices may be employed upon approval of USCG engineering.<br />Note 1: The USCG will inspect and paint the following areas during depot maintenance: Engines (propeller cap, and propellers), interior and frames of crew entrance doors, escape hatches and cargo ramp, landing gear and interior landing gear wells, flight control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, rudder, flaps) and their leading edge box structures, antennas and radomes during PDM. These areas do not require strip or painting by the contractor.<br />Note 2: The aircraft's exterior surface has numerous areas of composite materials.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The following answer questions of an interested party.<br /><br /></span>Question:</strong> In looking over this SOW I was unable to identify the "Site Inspection<br />Reports" referred to in Section 1.8.2 Site Inspection Survey. Can you<br />provide the form or an example?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Site Inspection Reports are the drawings in attachment B - Site Sketches Page 1- 21 of the Statement of Work (SOW)<br /><br /><strong>Question:</strong> Looking at the scope item 1.6 QA wherein it asks the Engineer to<br />affix his seal to all survey drawings. It appears that this would require a<br />Licensed Surveyor rather than a Licensed Engineer to sign and seal the<br />survey drawings, while it appears intended that an engineering report be<br />prepared regarding the Site Inspection report referred to above, which<br />presumably would need to be prepared and signed by a Licensed Engineer. <br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Investigation report will need the signature of a licensed Engineer while survey drawings will need the seal of a Licensed Surveyor. <br />

<p>The purpose of this procurement is to procure Text and Data Analytics (TDA) Software (BRAND NAME OR EQUAL TO PRODUCT) for a twelve (12) month period. This software is required to assist investigators and analysts in analyzing and presenting findings of voluminous amount of unstructured and structured evidentiary material.</p>
<p>1. DESCRIPTION OF WORK:<br />The Government requires a comprehensive analytical tool, TDA Solution software, to assist investigators and analysts in analyzing and presenting findings of voluminous amounts of unstructured and structured evidentiary material used in investigations conducted by FDA-Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI). As described below, the TDA solution must be capable to extract entities and identify relationships with full integration of a visualization tool to present such findings. Where indicated, the TDA Solution must utilize "out of the box" functionality to accomplish tasks. Due to the sensitivity of the evidentiary material, open source plug-ins or software cannot be utilized.</p>
<p>2. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:<br />Text and Data Extraction and Classification:<br />a. The TDA Solution must be able to process various Optical Character Recognition or searchable file formats such as but not limited to PDFs, Text Files, XML, Microsoft Office formats, and various email formats. The TDA Solution must have "out of the box" functionality to process the above listed formats in various languages.</p>
<p>b. The TDA Solution must have "out of the box" functionality to extract and classify text and data by entities.</p>
<p>The TDA Solution must be capable of accepting custom libraries or dictionaries as designated by FDA-OCI. Once these libraries and dictionaries are incorporated, the TDA Solution must be able to extract and classify the data. This includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceuticals, food products and additives, and medical devices.</p>
<p>Text/Data Parsing:<br />The TDA Solution must be able to parse fields containing structured data and extract and classify data by entity of the parsed fields on at least five forms designation by FDA-OCI. The data extraction from this process will be combined with extractions from unstructured data.</p>
<p>Relationship Identification:<br />The TDA Solution must be capable to use "out of the box" functionality to identify relationships between entities. This includes "out of the box" functionality to identify and tag financial relationships between entities. <br /><br />Sentiment of Written Communication:<br />The TDA Solution must have "out of the box" capability to determine the sentiment of written statements in unstructured text. The sentiment analysis includes the following:</p>
<p>&bull;Sentiment, characteristics of the entities of the sentiment, attributes<br />&bull;Sentiment, problem expressed by the sentiment, major, minor<br />&bull;Sentiment, requests and questions associated with the sentiment, new, existing, contact<br />&bull;Sentiment, strong positive, week positive, neutral, weak negative, strong negative</p>
<p>Data Cleansing and Disambiguation:<br />The TDA Solution must include the "out of the box" functionality to determine judgments regarding disambiguation of different but similar description of entities. This includes determining that variations of a name or an address are actually one person and address, respectively. Further, the TDA Solution must be capable to standardize this data and combine into single or reduced entity identification.</p>
<p>Search and Viewer:<br />The TDA Solution must include "out of the box" functionality to search, discover, and analyze by various methods and techniques.</p>
<p>Once entities are extracted and relationships identified, the TDA Solution must be capable of pointing to the source image containing the entity or relationship. This includes a viewer that will show the results of an entity or relationship search in PDF and Text File formats. The viewer will highlight the specific location of the entity or relationship in the PDF and Text File.</p>
<p>Visualization Tool:<br />The TDA Solution must include a fully integrated visualization tool with the text and data extraction and relationship identification as described above. The vendor must present documentation to demonstrate that the tool is integrated with these attributes as part of the award. Development and integration of a visualization tool with text and data extraction and relationship identification during configuration, testing and deployment of the TDA Solution is not permitted. The visualization tool must allow for the automated extraction of identified entities and relationships into the visualization tool. This includes icons or labels to identify entities and relationships. This must also include the "out of the box" identification and labeling of financial transactions between entities. The visualization tool must allow the end user to search by entities and to crate visualization reports or graphical representations of the search results. The above described viewer will be fully integrated with the visualization tool, as it will allow the end user view the source images based on the search criteria. The visualization tool must be capable of allowing the end user to filter results in order to focus on key investigative findings. The visualization tool must also be able to demonstrate results using link analysis, graphical, statistical, and geographical charts or tables.</p>
<p>Testing, Training and Knowledge Transfer, and Technical Assistance:<br />The TDA Solution software award should include hours for government usability testing prior to production. This includes creating a testing and development environment. In addition, prior to production, the vendor must provide 80 hours of knowledge transfer to FDA-OCI or designated user on the use of the TDA Solution. Further, the vendor must provide training to at least five (5) individuals identified by FDA-OCI on the use of the TDA Solution to include the text and data extraction and relationship and visualization tool components. The vendor must provide a total of 100 hours annually of technical assistance for troubleshooting and fine-tuning of the TDA Solution software. <br /><br />2.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice is posted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.204 (15 days). The Army Contracting Command - National Capital Region (ACC-NCR) at Hoffman II, on behalf of the Business Administration Support for U.S. ARMY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGENCY(USAITA). The intent of the USAITA is to be a customer-focused service provider that provides, manages, operates, and maintains Information Technology shared services for the Pentagon Area and select agencies and organizations in the National Capital Region (NCR). The Department of Defense Directive stated that USAITA was to be the central source for IT services, and therefore eliminate the requirement for each Department of Defense component to establish, operate and maintain duplicative technology. The policy also explicitly directed USAITA to manage costs, as the directive outlined the responsibility to operate as a business, and continually evaluate new commercial alternatives to providing existing capabilities in the interest of finding cost savings.<br><br>USAITA is a field-operating agency under the operational control of the Army's Office of the Administrative Assistant. USAITA is an Information Technology (IT) service provider, and provides a range of shared services to the National Defense community. USAITA's customer base consists primarily of Department of Defense services and agencies inside of the National Capital Region (NCR).<br><br>The Draft solicitation document is subject to change prior to release of the final RFP. The requirement is being prepared in accordance with the format FAR Part 15 and is anticipated to be a full and open competitive solicitation. The associated NAICS code is 541511. The size standard is $25 Million. The Government anticipates awarding a single award contract from the final solicitation. The period of performance is TBD. <br><br>Industry comments and questions are due 3 May 2012 at 11:00 PM EST.

Can you confirm that this is part of the same initiative?<br><br>Response 1: Yes, this requirement is the same initiative. The sources sought notice, as was stated, was issued to see if there were two or more small businesses that were capable of performing this requirement as part of our market research.<br>  <br>Question 2: Will this opportunity have a small business component?<br><br>Response 2: As stated within the draft solicitation, it provides for small business participation.<br><br>Question 3: Is this still a Small Business Set-Aside or has it been changed to Full and Open? <br><br>Response 3: This requirement was never set aside for small business.

Modification 0002 is being issued to answers some additional questions received on the subject synopsis 
N00178-12-Q-4179:  

Question 6:   In the SOW they indicate they want our hosting services to provide "(g) Anti-virus software for email, with the ability to add anti-virus software to the server" - I'd like some further guidance as to what anti-virus software they require as I do not see any other component of the SOW that requests us to provide email services (other than for our help desk service).

Answer 6:  Email service is standard in all web hosting packages we reviewed, so email hosting is expected as industry standard.
 The SOW asks that all email be protected by vendor installed and maintained antivirus software. It is also desired that the vendor provide file antivirus protection, but we realize not all vendors do so. We do, however, need the ability to install and maintain file antivirus if the vendor does not provide it.

Question 7:  They do not have any statement of expected reliability or uptime, but based upon the fact that they are not requesting RAID and only 1 uplink we assume they desire to also only have 1 power supply and that if a component breaks standard replacement times would apply (they aren't expecting us to always have 2 or 4 hour parts replacement, for example).

Answer 7:  All web hosts we reviewed included at least a 99.9% uptime guarantee, with a 30 minute maximum emergency response time.
 It is assumed that this is an industry standard for managed dedicated web hosts. It is up to the vendor how to meet this reliability, so we did not specify things such as RAID, redundant power supplies, hot spares, etc.

Question 8:  There is no backup requirement indicated.  Please confirm that no backup services are desired or expand upon what is preferred.

Answer 8:  Backups will be maintained offsite (from the vendor, that is) by the government via remote ssh and sftp.

  
All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.  Questions regarding this notice may be directed to phone number 540-653-7077 or emailed to dora.fauntleroy@navy.mil and reference RFQ

<DESC>The maintenance dredging for the Stockton and Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channels (DWSC) is conducted on an annual basis. The Sacramento DWSC is contained within the confines of the Sacramento River and the man-made portion of the ship channel. The Stockton DWSC follows the San Joaquin River. Due to natural sediment load moving down through these rivers, shoals develop which compromise the authorized depths of both ship channels. These shoals cause draft restrictions which increase the cost and safety for the shipping industry. Historically, approximately 200,000 to 400,000 cubic yards of shoaled material has been dredged annually. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is authorized by Congress to maintain both shipping channels to their authorized depths. Due to endangered species, the fisheries window for maintenance dredging is Aug 1 through Nov 30. After the winter storm run-off, the USACE conducts bathymetric surveys used to determine the shoaling that has developed. The USACE also develops the Notice of Intent (NOI) which is presented the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB). The NOI is used by the CVRWQCB to issue the Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification in the form a Notice of Applicability (NOA). <br /><br />This solicitation will be for a 3 year Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a maximum capacity of $10M per year for a total contract capacity of $30M. The estimated dredge quantities for the Task Orders will be developed from the NOA and bathymetric surveys. The pricing for Task Orders will be based on the individual pricing schedule set for each year of the contract. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Acquisition Information:<br /><br />THIS ACQUISITION IS PROCEEDING AS A UNRESTRICTED COMPETITIVE, INVITATION FOR BID (IFB). <br /><br />Minimum Guarantee of $20,000.00, Not-to-Exceed Value is $10,000,000.00 per year<br /><br />Period of Performance for Construction: To be Determined per Task Order<br /><br />This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Z216, SIC CODE: 1629, NAICS Code: 237990.

(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials;
(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;
(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;
(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and
(6) Energy Conservation/Sustainable Design Experience and Credentials.  List all design members who have LEED AP credentials.  List examples of projects designed with minimum LEED silver certification for projects with similar size and scope.
(7) Project Implementation Plan.  Provide implementation plan with any anticipated problems and potential solutions.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Interagency Program Office (IPO), Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) Presentation Layer 

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS.  A SUBSEQUENT SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT MAY FOLLOW.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO ANY FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENT.

VA, on behalf of the iEHR, is seeking qualified service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) and veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs) in anticipation of a future requirement.  VA is requesting all interested SDVOSBs and VOSBs to submit a written response to this Sources Sought notice.  This Sources Sought notice is issued for the sole purpose of conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. 

1.  OVERVIEW
Currently, when VA or Department of Defense (DoD) health care providers need to view patient information from the other Departments' beneficiary population, they must log into their agency specific system while referring to local remote data views that pull in data from the opposing system.  For example, when a Service Member (SM) is treated at a DoD Military Treatment Center, his/her information is entered into the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) via the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) and the data remains within AHLTA.  Similarly, if the same SM is later treated at a VA Medical Center, his/her information is entered into Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) through the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and the data from the encounter remains within the patients' EHR in CPRS.  In order to view the complete set of both records, a provider would be required to have access to both VistA/CPRS and CHCS/AHLTA to gain a perspective of the SM/Veteran's entire medical history.
  
In Spring 2011, the DoD and VA Health Executive Council signed an agreement to utilize the JANUS-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) prototype at Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC).  JANUS 4.0 is a copy written (attached) combined web-services engine and GUI developed jointly by VA and DoD Subject Matter Experts through various face-to-face requirements gathering and design sessions held in early 2011.  JANUS was first deployed and tested by both VA and DoD clinical staff at the TAMC.  Today, JANUS delivers CHCS and VistA data in a single user-customizable screen.  JANUS's web-based architecture is scalable, which allows it to grow with new data types or software packages and accommodate new features.

It is requested that any interested and qualified SDVOSB or VOSB submit the information required below via email to the point of contact listed at this bottom of this announcement.

2.  ANTICIPATED SCOPE OF WORK
The Contractor shall provide the necessary information technology services to complete modifications, enhancements, and change management support as contracted for the Presentation Layer.  The joint GUI and web-services engine implemented to the Presentation Layer will include:

    (a)  INTERFACE iEHR PRESENTATION LAYER TO A CONTEXT MANAGEMENT (CM) SYSTEM:  The Contractor will require experience with existing bridges at the James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (JALFHCC) as well as Single Sign-On (SSO) and CM capabilities in JANUS 4.0. The bridge modifications shall include enhanced logoff logic, customization, and modification of the access code field in the credential learning screens, a complete quality assurance cycle and documentation describing the new bridge configuration and operation. The Contractor may need to assist as needed in development of bridge software with Government developers or other Contractor developers.

    (b)  PROOF OF CONCEPT iEHR PRESENTATION LAYER PORTAL PILOT: The Contractor will require experience with the existing iEHR Portal work and JANUS widgets.  In conjunction with the iEHR Portal team, the Contractor shall evaluate an open-source portal using an open Service Oriented Architecture framework and leverage the existing iEHR Portal work to break out three (3) widgets from JANUS (e.g. demographics, labs, and prescriptions).  The Contractor shall portalize existing widgets as they appear in JANUS. 

The Contractor shall take another application that is wrapped in the portlet and analyze the interaction with the widgets when placed into the iEHR-identified portal.  The objective is to get content in the portal container to get maximum user subscription to that content.
 
    (c)  CAPABILITY TO PULL SERVICE MEMBER AND VETERAN DATA FROM DoD CLINICAL DATA REPOSITORY: The Contractor shall develop and document requirements and coordinate with DoD personnel to ensure that JANUS 4.0 will pull and display service member and veteran data from the DoD enterprise level rather than a local host for each DoD location.

    (d)  PROVIDE A NEW WRITE-BACK FUNCTIONALITY FOR ALLERGIES FOR CLINICAL USERS: The Contractor shall provide new write-back functionality to:
    - Provide an assessment of existing legacy write-back interfaces and provide a recommendation to help inform legacy adaptors needed for the iEHR enterprise solution.
    - Capture authorized DoD user direct entry Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) to Veteran/SM Allergy data that updates the matched VA Veteran record.
    - Capture authorized VA user direct entry (CRUD) to Veteran /SM Allergy data that updates the matched DoD SM record.
    - Capture audit history of all DoD user direct entry (CRUD) to Veteran/SM Allergy data that updates the matched VA Veteran record.
    - Capture audit history of all VA user direct entry (CRUD) to Veteran/SM Allergy data that updates the matched DoD SM record.

    (e)  IMPLEMENT ENHANCED INTEGRATED GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE IN USE AT JALFHCC TO TRIPLER ARMY MEDICAL FACILITY/VA HONOLULU: The Contractor will require experience with JANUS 4.0 and the existing iEHR at the Tripler Army Medical Facility/VA in Honolulu to install and implement the enhanced JANUS 4.0 at that location.  Tasks will include SSO/CM bridge modifications and the ability to pull SM and veteran data from the DoD Clinical Data Repository.

    (f)  IMPLEMENT THE ABILITY TO VIEW EXISTING PREVENTIVE HEALTH DATA: The Contractor will require capability and experience with developing widgets in JANUS 4.0 to compile and display existing Preventive Health data elements that are available in CPRS and AHLTA.

3.  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
Interested parties should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement not to exceed ten (10) pages (including any attachments) that clearly details the firm's ability to perform the aspects of the requirement described above.  Specifically, the Government requests that capability statements demonstrate the ability to perform based on relevant examples of similar performance or involvement with similar contracts or projects.
