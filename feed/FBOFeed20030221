<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for renewal of annual maintenance services for two Government-owned JEOL Scanning Electron Microscopes.  Period of performance for this service will be for a period not less than one (1) year with an option to extend the period of performance for one (1) additional year. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from JEOL USA as the only known responsible source who can meet Agency requirements.  There are no other sources that have the unique capability to supply the technical expertise needed to maintain the microscopes.  JEOL USA is the manufacturer of the equipment and all replacement parts are available only from JEOL.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to become familiar enough to maintain the equipment and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 3, 2003.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for the performance of Architectural-Engineering Planning and Design Services for a new U.S. Port of Entry at the Peace Arch crossing, Interstate 5, in Blaine, Washington. The new port will replace an existing 1976 port providing expansion space for Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Customs Service and Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service.  This border crossing is a non-commercial, 24 hours-seven days a week facility processing automobiles, recreational vehicles, bicyclical and pedestrians. The new facility is estimated to be approximately 102,400 gross square feet including 148 exterior parking spaces.  The estimated construction cost range for this project is $25-30 million.  The new Ports of Entry shall: 1) provide efficient and economical facilities for the use of the U.S. inspection agencies, 2) provide a balance between welcoming visitors and returning citizens and the priority of security at our border, and 3) provide a "visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability" of the U.S. government. The objective is to select a designer and firm supported by highly qualified design professionals who will produce an efficient and cost effective facility that exemplifies design excellence within project scope, schedule, and budget.  The facility will be designed in metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: preliminary programming and planning services (including cost estimating, site survey, and geo-technical work) with the goal of defining project scope and cost estimates.  In addition, the contract will include options for design services including metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computed added design and post construction contract services for the new port facility.  This facility will require a new building, canopies, roadways, parking, site development; client-programming requirements, sustainable features and shall be designed using GSA standards and the US Port of Entry Design Guide.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00421-03-R-0022 solicits/requests proposals for the study of the aging properties of fiber optics in a Naval aircraft environment. Responses to this BAA will be accepted at the Contracting Office for a three (3) month period from the date of this announcement and are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  Contract award will be based on a scientific and engineering evaluation of the response (technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) to determine the merit of the technical approach used. Of primary interest are studies that characterize the life expectancy of aviation grade fiber optic cables when they are placed in a Naval Aviation-like environment, which combines humidity, vibration and temperature variations into a single, all encompassing test.  Naval Air Systems Command, Aging Aircraft IPT, AIR 4.1D, is interested in receiving proposals regarding the study of the aging properties of fiber optic cables in a Naval aviation environment. The situation that we are looking to characterize is as follows:  Several studies have shown that moisture (humidity) can permeate certain fiber claddings in a relatively short period of time.  These studies have also indicated that this may weaken the fiber as well as degrade the optical signal and the cable?s available bandwidth.  Additionally, the studies show that these effects are accelerated by large temperature swings, vibration and stressing.  Overall this may effect the expected lifetime of the fiber.  No information concerning the lifetime of fiber in a Naval aviation environment exists in the available literature.  The Joint Council on Aging Aircraft is attempting to look ahead and address areas that may be a future Total Ownership Cost issue.  This study would require the analysis of aviation grade fibers placed in an environment similar to the one found in Naval aircraft in an effort to determine their aging properties.  Several studies have been published in journals regarding the effects of environment - particularly moisture - on the useful lifetime of fiber.  Today's fibers are being used in a number of applications including aircraft.  While the aircraft environment may be similar to other stressful environments, it is different enough that we cannot adequately address this issue without a detailed study.    Additionally, while the fibers in use today have been tested for individual environments, they have not been tested in a combined environmental test.  The proposal will be to study possible aviation grade fibers to characterize their properties in hopes of identifying the expected lifetime of these various fibers, identify which fibers performs best over time, and to see if the aviation environment causes fibers to behave unexpectedly.  This information should be useful to the Naval aviation industry and customers because it could allow for either changing their selected fiber, changing their method of installation, or planning for scheduled maintenance. The object is risk and cost reduction.  Proposals may be submitted anytime during the three (3) month period following publication of this announcement. Proposals may address one or more of the concepts listed above. Proposals shall be limited to exploratory development where feasibility has already been demonstrated. More than one proposal may be submitted.  Early submission is encouraged. Proposals may be evaluated as they are received or may be collected and reviewed periodically. The merit of the proposals shall be determined based on the following criteria: (1) Overall scientific and technical merit, (2) the offeror's ability to demonstrate feasibility; (3) the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives, and (4) realism of proposed cost. Please provide a detailed breakdown of approach, available resources, proposed cost/prices, and a preliminary schedule so an analysis can be performed. Technical proposals shall not exceed twenty-five (25) pages. Contractors shall submit one (1) original and four (4) copies of their proposal to Contracts Group, Attn: Darrall Lafayette, Code 251315, NAVAIRSYSCOMHQ, Bldg 441, Unit 7, 21983 Bundy Road, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127. The cost of preparation of the response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to the resulting contract or any other contract. The point of contact for technical issues is Mr. Dan Slick (301) 342-2275, e-mail: slickdg@navair.navy.mil. Mr. Darrall Lafayette (301) 757-8956, email: lafayettede@navair.navy.mil is the point of contact for contractual matters. Offerors may contact these individuals, at any time, for clarification of technical/contractual issues and cost response format. In addition, a question and answer document under this BAA will reside on the following website for questions received of a general nature: http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm. Offerors are cautioned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. For planning purposes, the period of performance is estimated to be from 3 to 6 months at a level of effort of 0.5 to 3 man-years per year for each contract. Reasonable deviations / exceptions will be considered. Contract type will be a firm fixed price completion. No formal solicitation will be issued; this BAA is the solicitation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI3025).  A solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-11.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure on a sole source basis using Simplified Acquisition procedures Custom Peptides Synthesis with Alpha Diagnostics International. To continue this on-going research, 550 custom made peptides with amino acid sequences will cover the genes of HIV-1 Env, Gag, Pol and Nef from different clades.  These custom-synthesized 15-amino acids peptides with 11 amino acids overlapping each other will be made in 25mg scale with over 75% purity by HPLC.  The purpose of this requirement is to develop vaccine for HIV, Ebola and potentially, other viral diseases.  Making different mutations of viral proteins is critical in the vaccine development.  After making different mutations of viral protein, those vaccine candidates will be evaluated for their immunogenicities against the viral proteins.  Having various reliable and accurate assays to measure the B cell and T cell response in animals after immunization is an essential part of this process.   The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Deseases has used these custom peptides for years.  It is imperative that the same consistent high quality specific custom peptides synthesis be used.  Such consistency is essential for analysis data between different experiments at different times.  Therefore, we must maintain continuity of  reagents to insure experimental results are not influenced by new variables and to avoid delays in testing products from other suppliers, changing vendors now would compromise results.  Project#  Z5001, Title: ?Clinical research protocol application:  Observational study of virologic and immunologic correlates of progression and disease in HIV?.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 Commercial and Simplified procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with MTS Systems Corporation for Test Cell 3 Upgrade from ACAP to a Combustion Analysis System due to existing proprietary software and the need for data integrity with existing systems. NVFEL needs to upgrade the ACAP Combustion System in its Test Cell 3 to a Combustion Analysis System (CAS).  The CAS system is used to analyze engine combustion processes by measuring the engine cylinder pressure and crankshaft rotation signals.  The basic CAS system consists of an operator interface computer which runs the CAS software, a VXI crate which contains two instrumentation cards that perform signal measurement, and two interface panels and cabling.  NVFEL intends to build and assemble the CAS system in house using MTS components in conjunction with a NVFEL standard operator interface computer system and an existing VXI crate.  This will make the new system have the exact same components as NVFEL existing CAS systems.  The CAS system will be connected to existing instrumentation in the engine testing cells, including cylinder pressure transducers, amplifiers, encoders and cabling. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received by March 7, 2003 in order to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties should submit a written response to Scott Tharp by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail Tharp.Scott@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a requirement for a Differential Global Positioning System (GPS) W-9000 System containing all the equipment and software necessary for NOAA to configure it such that it is interchangeable with the NASA "three-thermistor" system (with NOAA obtaining NASA-unique software separately).  This system will be used by NOAA as a reference system in the testing of radiosonde performance with respect to temperature measurements in the atmosphere.  Delivery of the W-9000 system shall be made F.O.B. Destination to the National Weather Service (NWS) Test and Evaluation Facility in Sterling, Virginia within four months after award.  NOAA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sippican, Inc. (Sippican), located in Marion, Massachusetts, for this W-9000 system.  Sippican is the manufacturer of the W-9000 system and is the only known source that can provide this equipment.  This acquisition will be accomplished using simplified acquisition procedures.  Request for Quotation (RFQ) No. WE0000-3-00025 will be issued on or about March 5, 2003 and will close on or about March 20, 2003.  NOAA expects award to be made not later than April 4, 2003.  Although NOAA expects that only Sippican can provide the required W-9000 system, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by NOAA.

<DESC>This announcement modifies previous information posted 13 February 2003.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is N62477-03-R-0012.  The project title is changed to Michelson Hall Renovation, United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland.  This acquisition will be conducted through full and open competition utilizing competitive negotiations, specifically source selection procedures.  Award will be based on the best value to the Government considering the price and non-priced items described in the solicitation, including Relevant Experience, Past Performance, Schedule and Subcontracting Plan.  The Project is located on the campus of the United States Naval Academy and consists of the complete renovation of the Michelson Hall, including Architectural, Structural, Mechanical, Fire Protection, Electrical, Telecommunications/Data, and Security systems.  The project involves complete demolition of all non-structural interior elements of the building, including HazMat abatement, and involves complete reconfiguration of the interior walls, circulation and engineering systems of the building, as well as limited renovation of the exterior building envelop.  The project consists of an approximately 41,000 GSM (135,000 GSF) academic facility consisting of laboratories, classrooms, offices and support spaces, configured as an office/classroom building on the upper levels and sharing a common laboratory floor with the adjacent Chauvenet Hall at the ground level.  Michelson Hall, together with adjacent Chauvenet Hall, houses the Science and Math Departments of USNA and is used for the teaching of Chemistry, Biology, Oceanography, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.  The Michelson-Chauvenet Halls complex was built in the early 1970s and the building systems and laboratory equipment have both reached the limit of their expected service life and therefore need to be completely replaced.  The building layout and services do not effectively support the requirements of current teaching methods and curricula and therefore need to be completely re-configured.  The estimated project cost range for the renovation of Michelson Hall is approximately 25,000,000 to 35,000,000.  The project is subject to a compressed construction schedule due to mandatory academic year constraints.  The renovation of Chauvenet Hall will be a separate contract anticipated for award in fiscal year 2004.  The solicitation will be issued on 27 February 2003.  Sustainable design features and commissioning requirements will be issued via amendments to the solicitation.  Interested parties can obtain a copy of the solicitation via http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil/    The website is free and provides instructions for downloading the solicitation file.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading a copy of the solicitation and also for monitoring this site for the release of solicitation amendments.  The closing date and time for receipt of proposals is 2:00PM on 15 April 2003.  The date, time and location of the pre-proposal conference and site visit will be provided in the solicitation.  Interested parties are encouraged to sign up for the conference at the website listed above.  All contractual and technical inquiries or questions must be submitted in writing to the attention of Terry Gragg, Contract Specialist, via email.   Inquiries should be submitted to the Government by 4 April 2003 in order to permit a timely response.  Inquiries received after that date are not guaranteed a response prior to the proposal due date.  The successful offeror must be registered in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Offerors not already registered are encouraged to do so via www.ccr.gov/ or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

A sensor is sought which meets the following performance requirements: (1) Precipitation Types: Drizzle, Rain, Snow, Hail and Ice Pellets as defined in FMH-1 (without user intervention); (2) Precipitation Intensities: Light, Moderate, and Heavy as defined in FMH-1; (3) EPI sensor shall detect and correctly identify the precipitation types for all precipitation rates greater than zero but less than 250mm per hour on an event basis as verified by a certified observer; (4) The EPI shall not report any precipitation when no precipitation is occurring (e.g., drizzle, rain, snow, hail, and ice pellets); (5) The EPI shall operate in the following laboratory test conditions, operational temperature limits: (a) low temperature operational, minus 60 degrees F; (b) high temperature operational, plus 120 degrees F.  Furthermore, the sensor shall survive exposure to the following temperature extremes with no damage; (c) low temperature withstanding, minus 80 degrees F; (d) high temperature withstanding, plus 130 degrees F. (6) The EPI shall operate under the following laboratory test conditions, operational wind limits: (a) operational steady wind, up to 30 knots; (b) operational wind gust, up to 46 knots.  Furthermore, the sensor will survive exposure to the following wind extremes with no damage: (c) Withstanding steady wind, up to 73 knots; (d) Withstanding wind gust, up to 125 knots.  (7) The EPI shall operate in laboratory rain conditions up to 3 inches per hour with 30 knot winds.  (8) The EPI shall operate in laboratory ice accretion conditions up to 1 inch with 20 knots wind and withstand up to 3 inches with 35 knots wind.  (9) Reliability and Maintainability: (a) Mean Time Between Failure, greater than or equal to 10,000 hours; (b) Periodic Maintenance interval, not less than 100 days; (c) Mean Time to Repair, less than or equal to 30 minutes.

We are requesting all interested and qualified firms respond to this sources sought notice with the following information: (1) Name, Address, Phone, Fax, and E-Mail, (2) A list (not to exceed 5) of similar projects your firm currently holds or has completed within the last three years, and (3) Curriculum Vitae for the proposed Principal Investigator and the next most senior level technical person that would be proposed, must be submitted to support this set-aside.

The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, is interested in soliciting information from organizations that are HUBZONE qualified to provide technical and scientific resource support services to the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences in: specific scientific expertise; materials development and dissemination (writing, editing, and graphic support for scientific and technical publication preparation); planning, data management and analysis; scientific conference, meetings, and workshop administrative management; and liaison with the cancer control and population science research community. C.V.?s to be submitted must document experience in these areas within the past five years. Work will be assigned by Work Assignment for each specific project.

Also, the offeror must demonstrate the ability to be available within 24 hours notice for meetings and for receipt and delivery of reports and materials to NCI?s off-campus buildings, currently 6130 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland. The majority of the work assignments for this project require close interaction between the Contractor and NCI personnel. The writing and data analysis work assignments require frequent interaction between the Contractor and NCI staff to resolve errors and inconsistencies. Furthermore, the acquisition of information and data analysis are iterative processes, and frequent interaction between the Contractor and NCI staff are essential. Scientific and technical writing and preparation of graphs, tables and figures will also require frequent interaction between the Contractor and NCI staff.

Information to be provided must not exceed 10 pages with an additional 10 pages for the C.V.?s of the two senior personnel. If the personnel proposed are not current employees of the Contractor, letters of commitment must be provided.

<DESC>INITIAL PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN A-76 FULL COST COMPARISON STUDY The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to conduct a public / private full cost comparison study in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 for test administration services for government customers across the country through its Nationwide Testing Program. This Program provides test and applicant scheduling, test  administration, and test warehousing and distribution services for customers of the OPM. Through its testing network, OPM has the capability to administer employment and other tests at thousands of locations nationwide, with a commitment to offer any test at any location for their customers. During FY2002, OPM provided scheduling and test administration services for over 7000 employment test sessions in hundreds of locations requested by its Federal agency customers.  OPM also conducted approximately 34,000 sessions of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) for the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command.  Of these ASVAB sessions, OPM conducted about 20,000 Enlistment sessions at 564 fixed sites and over 13,000 Student sessions at thousands of high schools throughout the United States.  OPM warehouses and distributes test material to support these sessions through its Denver Distribution Center (DDC).  The DDC has about six million tests in its inventory and another six million test-related items.  During FY2002, the DDC handled about 15,000 shipments of test material to and from authorized test administrators around the country.  Security of the test material at all times to prevent loss or compromise is an essential part of the services OPM provides to its customers.

Flight vehicles and engines are not expected to be recovered or reused.  Each flight vehicle will use a single HyTech engine.  This effort will enable assessment of the HyTech scramjet engine?s performance, operability, and future military utility for atmospheric and access to space missions.  Ultimately, five (5) powered flights are envisioned to expand the flight envelope.  The first two (2) flights will be within the heart of the flight envelope to demonstrate nominal engine operability and performance with engine operation terminated after reaching Mach 6.5 to 7.  Subsequent flights will incrementally expand the envelope to demonstrate maximum Mach and maximum cruise.  The flight program will also include separation of the integrated booster/research vehicle from the launch aircraft and separation of the research vehicle from the booster.  First flight is anticipated in fiscal year 2006 or 2007.  This effort will reduce risk for the NASA/AFRL X-43C flight project.  An engine ground-test program will identify potential engine improvements to the HyTech scramjet to enhance operability of the flight test engines.  The program includes design (including multidisciplinary design optimization) and fabrication for the flight vehicles, the HyTech engines, booster modification, booster/flight vehicle integration, and all flight-testing.  This program will build upon the Affordable Rapid Response Missile Demonstrator (ARRMD) heritage wave rider configuration.  This effort will develop and demonstrate an Enhanced Operability Engine (EOE) and complete Preliminary Design Review (PDR) of the flight vehicle.  The flight engine design will be finalized and a Flight Clearance Engine (FCE) will be demonstrated.  Vehicle Critical Design Review (CDR) will be accomplished.  Flight vehicles will be fabricated and tested.  The total program duration is expected to be 60 months including reporting.  The purpose of this synopsis is to provide the AF technical team with the ability to determine the capabilities of potential respondents.  If you believe you have the capability as a prime contractor (subcontractors need not respond) to meet the Government?s requirements, respond no later than 15 days after publication of the sources sought synopsis.  Any prime contractor interested in this announcement must respond with a complete capability/qualifications package describing the company?s technical expertise, experience, and facilities to accomplish the work described above.  Responses shall be submitted in writing and no more than 25 pages in length (8.5?x 11? paper).  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size, particularly if they occupy one or more of the following categories; socially and economically disadvantaged business; a woman-owned business, minority institution; or foreign-owned/foreign-controlled business and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.  The general definition to be used to determine whether or not your firm is small is as follow:  ?Small business concern" means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR Part 121 (see FAR 19.102). "Concern" means any business entity organized for profit (even if its ownership is in the hands of a nonprofit entity) with a place of business located in the United States and which makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes and/or use of American products, material and/or labor, etc.  NAICS Code 541710 applies.  The AF reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses hereto.  Foreign firms are asked to immediately notify the Contracting POC cited above before deciding to respond to this announcement.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Sources Sought for MUOS RR&DD/A&OS effort
<SOLNBR>SPAWAR Headquarters MKTSVY 245F6
<RESPDATE>031703
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Salvatore M Cianci, Contract Specialist, 619-524-7184
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) and its Communications Satellite Program Office (PMW 146) are seeking to identify responsible prime sources (i.e. prime contractor or contracting teams) capable of performing the Risk Reduction and Design Development and Acquisition and Operations Support (RR&DD/A&OS) efforts for the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS).  MUOS is the next generation narrowband Military Satellite Communications system that will replace the currently operational UHF Follow-On (UFO) system. THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, but rather this is a request for information in order for the Government to identify interested sources that are capable of performing the MUOS RR&DD/A&OS efforts.  The purpose of this sources sought is to identify potential prime sources that: (1)   can adequately demonstrate their current capabilities; and (2)   have a detailed plan of action that shows the ability to meet System Design Review (SDR) requirements in the timeline required to propose for the pending RR&DD/A&OS contract. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized under separate cover on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  The information requested herein will be used to support a potential solicitation in 4th quarter FY03 and resulting contract award in the 2nd quarter of FY04.  All information provided below is for planning purposes and is subject to change. The MUOS required Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is 2008 and Full Operational Capability (FOC) is 2013.  SPAWAR plans to competitively award, on the basis of best value, one contract containing: o     A firm cost-reimbursement effort for the design, development, test and fielding of the initial MUOS satellite and associated ground infrastructure; o     Options for fixed-price production & launch of the remaining MUOS satellites, network control & satellite control ground equipment and; o     An optional cost-reimbursement effort for in-service support of the system from IOC to FOC. The project timeline for this acquisition is: o     Draft in April 2003 solicitation (see summary Attachment 1); o     Final solicitation in August 2003; and o     Proposals in November 2003. Currently, MUOS is in the Component Advanced Development (CAD) phase.  Two contractor teams, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company in Sunnyvale, CA and Raytheon Company in St. Petersburg, FL, are performing this requirement under contracts awarded via full and open competition, N00039-02-C-3295 and N00039-02-C-3296, respectively.  The critical outcomes of each CAD phase contract are risk reduction and a successful System Design Review (SDR) with the Government MUOS team with subsequent delivery of an SDR package (i.e. detailed design documentation and plans).  The completion of such SDR requirements (see summary Attachment 2) for the current CAD contracting teams is scheduled for October and November 2003. Any offeror for the MUOS RR&DD/A&OS efforts will be required to successfully complete an SDR, similar to that required of the CAD contracting teams, with the Government MUOS Team and incorporate the resulting SDR package into its proposal for the RR&DD/A&OS contract.  Any prime sources (i.e. prime contractor or contracting teams) shall reply to this synopsis if they are interested in proposing for the MUOS RR&DD/A&OS phase contract.  Potential offerors shall present their demonstrated capabilities and detailed plan of action in a Qualification Package to the SPAWAR MUOS Government Team via a face-to-face meeting not to last longer than four hours per potential offeror.  Potential offerors shall submit the Qualification Package (via electronic means to the SPAWAR E-commerce website) no later than three business days prior to the scheduled face-to-face meeting.  The Qualification Package shall contain the contents for briefing the Government Team in the face-to-face meeting.   The Government Team is available to meet with such offerors (four hours per offeror) from March 24th-28th, 2003.  One of these four hours shall be considered reserved for questions and answers.  Interested offerors shall arrange exact dates/times with the SPAWAR contracts point of contact Mr. Sal Cianci via e-mail only at Salvatore.Cianci@navy.mil.  Acknowledgment of receipt will be made by e-mail.  Telephone inquiries will not be honored. Mr. Cianci must by contacted by 4:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on Tuesday, March 11th, 2003. In lieu of a Qualification Package, each of the current CAD contracting teams shall submit a written response (no longer than two pages) by 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on Monday, March 17th, 2003 clearly stating: (a)   whether or not it plans to compete for the RR&DD/A&OS contract; and (b)   the status of its teaming arrangement (both current and future members and their roles). This is NOT a request for proposals.  Proprietary data in responses will be protected where so designated.  All respondents should indicate their company size status and the extent to which they can include small business participation (of all small business categories listed in FAR 19.7). Contractor size status is based on NAICS Code 334220 with an SBA size standard of 750 employees.  Partnering between small and large businesses is encouraged.  Responses received in reply to this notice may, in part, be used to make a determination of the level of competition for the resulting solicitation (e.g., full and open competition, SB set-aside, 8(a) set-aside, etc.). Evaluation of proposals submitted in response to the MUOS RR&DD/A&OS solicitation (planned for August 2003 release) will include a evaluation of proposed MUOS designs, risks, costs, estimated ownership costs, and offerors' plans, organization, facilities, and capabilities to satisfy the requirements of the solicitation while achieving IOC and FOC within schedule.   This following list provides a summary of critical requirements for the RR&DD/A&OS efforts.  This list is neither a complete nor a final listing of such requirements.   More detailed requirements will be provided with the draft solicitation(s) and a final listing of requirements will be provided with the final solicitation. The RR&DD/A&OS solicitation will require offerors to: 1) define a system architecture that meets the MUOS performance requirements and affordability constraints at verifiable and acceptable levels of risk; 2) identify and define MUOS internal and external interfaces; 3) describe the specifics of system production, deployment, and operations processes; 4) describe the associated system development, deployment, and operation processes that must be used in the RR&DD and production phases; 5) identify high technical risk items and key cost drivers and demonstrate how they will be managed; 6) demonstrate the capability of significant risk MUOS components, technologies, and subsystems in a relevant environment; 7) identify the complete set of components/subsystems to be integrated into the full system; and 8) demonstrate the capability to achieve MUOS IOC in 2008 and FOC by 2013. The following paragraphs provide a summary of SDR requirements.  This summary is not a complete listing of requirements for the SDR.

<DESC>NA The Government seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to the privatization of the potable water treatment and distribution utility systems at the Edgewood Area of the U.S. Army Garrison Aberdeen Proving Ground (AP G-EA), in accordance with 10 USC 2688, Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and obligation to serve responsibilities.  These include such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations and upgrades, construction, equip ment and manpower, of Government-owned systems to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or to another entity. APG-EA is located about 35 miles northeast of Baltimore on a 69,000-acre tract extending along and into the Chesapeake Bay, and is home to the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command and fifty tenant activities.  The Installation is predominantly, but not to tally, an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction (also referred to as a Federal enclave).  APG-EA is supplied potable water from two sources.  The primary source historically was the Winters Run River.  The other source is a connection to the Harford Count y Department of Public Works municipal potable water system.  Due to drought conditions and sedimentation at the upstream Government-owned Atkinson Dam, Harford County more recently has been the predominant, if not the exclusive, potable water source.  Har ford County provides as-required potable water under standard commercial service rates.  The continued availability of this water source on an as required basis and pursuant to standard regulated service rates is critical to the Installation’s mission. Potable water from Harford County is supplied from a 12-inch water line located near the potable water treatment plant (WTP).  The design capacity of the WTP is 4.0 million gallons per day (MGD), although equipment constraints limit the capacity to about 2 .0 MGD.  Average water production is about 1.0 MGD.  The potable water distribution system includes:  the Atkinson Dam and reservoir; the 1.75 million gallon Hanson Reservoir ground storage facility; seven steel elevated storage tanks (combined capacity of  1.175 million gallons); and 71.5 miles of water mains and lines ranging from ¾ to 24 inches in diameter.  There are no pumping stations.  The Atkinson Dam was constructed in 1942 and is located on the Winters Run River.  The dam is about 56 feet high and 468 feet in length.  Its size classification is intermediate and its hazard classification is high.  Due to sedimentation, the principle us e of the dam and reservoir is public access recreation.  The related specific elements of the privatized potable water service requirement include: (1) service to all areas within the APG-EA; (2) continued and uninterrupted access to as required upstream p otable water utility service by Harford County under regulated rates and service conditions; and (3) preservation of the beneficial public use of the Atkinson Dam and reservoir. In accordance with Section IV.A.2 of the Department of Defense’s 9 October 2002 Revised Guidance for the Utilities Privatization Program, it is anticipated that the source selection process shall consider possible long-term costs and benefits to the United  States, if the conveyance (of the potable water system) affects separate contract relationships, particularly for commodities.  It is further anticipated that the imputed incremental cost of potable water supplies from Harford County will be added to the proposed privatized service life cycle cost of any offeror that did not adequately and fully demonstrate that Harford County potable water commodity service relations would not be adversely affected if the system were owned by that offeror. This request for information (RFI) is a component of a systematic process to implement the Department of the Army’s utility privatiz atioportion and its sp ecific tasks.  You must include the contract type, total dollar value and name/phone of a customer point of contact and contracting officer’s name and telephone number for each contract; (7) list any contracts your company is currently performing that woul d be considered the same as/similar to this effort (size, scope, complexity), as well as those you have completed within the last three years, including contract type, dollar value, and references with names and phone numbers; (8) whether your company is p erforming these efforts successfully (indicators are percentage of award fee given; favorable past performance ratings; absence of Contract Discrepancy Reports; deductions; Cure/Show Cause Notices; or Option periods not exercised; (9) were contracts won co mpetitively; if not, list those which were not won competitively; (10) provide total value of all revenue your company received from 1 Oct 01 through 30 Sep 02 and two previous years (revenue is defined as accounting revenue used in support of your company ’s Federal Income Tax Returns); (11) provide additional information that will support your financial capability to perform projects of this magnitude; (12) identify specific proposals you have prepared in response to RFP’s, identify the customers requestin g the proposals with points of contact names and phone numbers – if your proposal was the winning offer and for any requests for proposals you did not win, did you meet the solicitation’s competitive range criteria.  Specify if you submitted any proposals in line with best value (trade-off process) evaluation and provide supporting information and explanations and points of contact; identify any other specific proposals you have prepared demonstrating capability in preparing and submitting complex offers fo r large scale requirements such as, but not limited to, lowest price/technically acceptable; (13) if your company normally competes as its own business entity or as a joint venture when competing for this type of work.  If you anticipate teaming with other  small businesses to perform this requirement, you as the managing venturer should have each member of your joint venture team complete all previous questions.  You as the managing venturer should provide a copy of any proposed joint venture agreement that  would apply to this requirement.  NOTE: Teaming with a large business firm is not considered, nor does it apply, as a Small Business Joint Venture.  To qualify as a Small Business Joint Venture, each venturer must be a small business under the size standa rd of $23 million in annual revenue; (14) on the average, what percentage of total effort does your company normally subcontract for this type and magnitude of work; describe how your company maintains effective control (management and quality) over subcon tracted reports of these contracts and list major subcontractors including name, address and telephone of primary point of contact; (15) what specific portions and percentages of subcontracting would you anticipate to perform this requirement; (16) discuss  your knowledge, understanding and compliance with federal regulations and policies pertaining to environmental health and safety issues and concerns.  Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determ ine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.  Please limit your responses to no more than 15 pages total.  The type should be no smaller than 12 pt pic a.  A page is defined as one single-side.  Your capability statement is required by COB 11 Mar 03 to U.S. Army Contracting Agency, Southern Region, Directorate of Contracting, ATTN: SFCA-SR-SI (Gerri Lucas), PO Box 33501, Fort Sill, OK  73503-0501 or e-mail address:  lucasg@sill.army. mil.

<SUBJECT>S--Sources Sought Privatization Under 10 USC 2688, Utility Systems Conveyance Authority Of Wastewater Collection And Treatment Utility Systems At The Edgewood Area Of The Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland
<SOLNBR>YET TO BE DECIDED
<RESPDATE>032303
<ARCHDATE>05222003
<CONTACT>Kandi McDonald, 410-278-2372
<DESC>NA The Government seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to the privatization of the wastewater collection and treatment utility systems at the Edgewood Area of the U.S. Army Garrison Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG-EA) , in accordance with 10 USC 2688, Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and obligation to serve responsibilities.  These include such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations and upgrades, construction, equip ment and manpower, of Government-owned systems to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or to another entity. APG-EA is located approximately 35 miles northeast of Baltimore on a 69,000-acre tract extending along and into the Chesapeake Bay, and is home to the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command and fifty tenant activities.  The Installation is predominantly, bu t not totally, an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction (also referred to as a Federal enclave). Most of the wastewater collection system was installed in the 1940’s and there have been only minor upgrades since then.  The system contains about 39.5 miles of pipes that range from 1.5 to 30 inches in diameter and 19 lift stations, ten of which are of t he dry well/wet well type.  The collection system transports mixed waste to the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) located on the southeast side of APG-EA near the end of Beach Point Road.  The plant is a Federally Owned Treatment Works (FOTW) and as such q ualifies for the mixed waste exclusion under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).  The exclusion allows the commingling of domestic sewage and discharges from industrial pretreatment facilities.  Treated effluent is discharged into Bush Creek .  The rated capacity of the WWTP is 3.0 million gallons per day (MGD), average flow is 0.9 MGD, and flows have peaked as high as 11.0 MGD.  WWTP discharges meet or exceed current effluent discharge requirements. The related specific elements of the privatized wastewater service requirement include: (1) service to all areas within the APG-EA; (2) transfer of ownership of and operational responsibilities for the WWTP, to include a requirement that the new owner secu re all applicable operating and discharge permits in its name; and (3) designation of the privatized WWTP as a Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) within the meaning of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the related eligibility for the Act’s mixed waste exclusion. This request for information (RFI) is a component of a systematic process to implement the Department of the Army’s utility privatization program.  If responsive statements of interest are received, a follow-on element of the process may be an industry for um to be held at the Aberdeen Proving Ground.

<SUBJECT>A -- AEF - Industry Day Announcement
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Flight Vehicles Integration Branch (AFRL/MNAV) is announcing an Industry Day briefing and optional, afternoon and next-day, one-on-one team appointments for the Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) Munition program.  The AEF Industry Day will be held at Eglin AFB, FL, beginning at 0800 on Wednesday, 15 Jan 03, in conjunction with the Persistent Area Dominance (PAD) Industry Day announced under MNK-PRDA-03-0004.  Foreign-owned companies are prohibited from participation at the prime contractor level, but may take advantage of available subcontracting opportunities.  

The AEF munition program objective is to develop a next-generation, miniature, long-range, standoff weapon for use in conjunction with today's highly mobile and forward-deployed Air Expeditionary Forces.  The program will involve exploration and integration of airframe, micro-munition dispensing, propulsion, data link, and payload integration technologies into an AEF Munition.  These new technologies will provide a low-cost, long-range, compact, and precise munition to defeat sophisticated mobile and limited fixed enemy targets.  Current cruise missiles address the need for a long-range standoff weapon, but these relatively expensive systems are limited to large launch platforms and fixed target sets.  The AEF Munition will employ miniature technologies, which allow delivery from legacy and next-generation fighter/bombers against mobile and fixed enemy targets.  The weapon's efficient propulsion system will allow for long-range midcourse cruise before micro-munitions are released against an intended target.  The payload to defeat the target may consist of a unitary warhead or use multiple dispensed guided micro-munitions to increase target kills per sortie.  The challenge is to design a robust suite of technologies that will integrate into a low-cost solution.  The Government anticipates one contract award for an approximate 3-year program.

Although the conference will be unclassified, visit requests and approved DD Forms 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, are required.  For one-on-one team appointments, limit team size to a total of five personnel.  Interested parties/firms must schedule attendance and identify personnel attending the AEF Industry Day briefing, and one-on-one team appointments, prior to 7 Jan 03, with the AEF Program Manager, Dr. Mike Valentino, at 850-882-8878, ext. 3331, email michael.valentino@eglin.af.mil, telefax 850-882-4793.  Dr. Valentino can also provide visit request and specific meeting locations information.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Aircraft Electronic Kneeboard
<DESC>NOTE:  
This DRAFT Initial Requirements Document is for an electronic kneeboard or electronic flight bag - This is an unfunded program that is still in concept development.  The USAF POC is Mr. Bob Peterman, AF/XORC.  Your comments are welcome until 24 Mar 03.  bob.peterman@pentagon.af.mil         Ph: 703-690-3341
1. Introduction.       
Revolutionary changes are needed in cockpit information management to maximize our national Air and Space power.  Technological advances enable inexpensive e-tools to improve organization, increase situational awareness and speed decision-making to produce safer, more effective peacetime training and wartime employment.  The Global Warfighter Information System (GWIS) is the solution.
Current platforms incorporate improved displays and information management but fall short of today?s technological potential.  Despite advances in cockpit technology, information management has remained nearly unchanged while the amount of data has increased dramatically; the warfighter is drowning in data, but lacks real information.  The result is an overwhelming workload.  Interim solutions partially fill the immediate need, but are not integrated and do not address complex information management challenge of today?s warfighter.  Past improvements in cockpit management were accomplished with expensive hardware and OFP updates but today?s technology allows us to meet the warfighter?s needs in a timely manner at a lower cost with GWIS.
The three key components of GWIS are: digitized mission information, a multi-source information portal, and an interactive input/output device - the GWIS Cockpit Data Assistant (CDA).
?	Intelligently digitized information can reduce or eliminate the use of paper for flight operations?something that has remained virtually unchanged through 100 years of powered flight.  It will place vital information at the warfighters fingertips, leading to improved cockpit information management and increased mission effectiveness.
?	The multi-source information portal will load the CDA using feeds from numerous and diverse sources.  It will integrate planning tools and programs, and ensure information currency, accuracy and integrity.  
?	The GWIS CDA will present information with a minimum of effort and distraction.  It will be compatible with mission planning systems to load and host aircraft and mission specific information.  The CDA will be used in pre-mission, execution and post-mission.
The Global Warfighter Information System will significantly improve mission performance, increase efficiency and enhance safety using existing and emerging technology.
1.	General Description of Operational Capabilities.
1.1.	Mission Need      ?DRAFT as of 30 Aug 02?
Due to the nature of today?s asymmetric threats, the warfighter has an immediate need for intelligently formatted information to ensure decisive and timely mission execution.  The increasingly complex combat environment requires an integrated  information system to optimize information management and presentation.  Warfighters need to expeditiously exploit all information to execute their mission.  By leveraging advances in technology warfighters will possess an information management system that allows them to sustain aerospace dominance today and in the future.
1.2.	Current Capabilities    ?DRAFT as of 30 Aug 02?
The USAF in-flight information architecture consists of non-integrated paper media, aircraft systems, and carry-on communication/computing devices.  Examples of information presented on paper media include Flight Information Publications (FLIP), aircraft manuals, checklists, performance manuals, and navigation charts.  On board systems include sensors, data links, and displays.  Carry on systems combine devices such as Iridium satellite phones, laptop computers (incorporating FalconView moving map), and GPS receivers.
 
1.3.	Concept of Employment.  ?DRAFT as of 30 Aug 02?
GWIS provides tailored flight and mission information from multiple agencies/sources using COTS/GOTS hardware and software.  GWIS is employed through three phases: pre-mission, execution, and post-mission.  
During the pre-mission phase GWIS will support selecting and loading relevant information to the GWIS Cockpit Data Assistant (CDA).  Data will be appropriately validated and formatted at its source and delivered via multiple-source data portals.  This data is tailored to fit mission profiles/platforms and may include weather, FLIP/Aeronautical Information, route, Geospatial (charts, imagery), and tasking documents.
During the execution phase, mission information will be presented to the warfighter on the GWIS CDA in a timely manner.  Mission information includes divert fields, time critical targeting or retasking information, threat updates, airfield diagrams, approach plates, flight manuals, and relevant situational awareness displays including moving map.  The CDA will be all-weather, day/night, and Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) compatible.
During the post-mission phase, GWIS will support mission review, debrief, and reporting of relevant flight and mission information.  Examples include operational, maintenance, and intelligence reporting.
2.	Threat.    ?DRAFT as of 30 Aug 02?
GWIS interfaces with C4I systems, and has similar vulnerabilities.  Possible threats include information warfare (IW), electromagnetic, and physical threats.  IW (activities by terrorist groups, foreign intelligence services, or organized crime which may include viruses, data corruption, intrusion, or reverse engineering) is the primary threat.  Additionally, electromagnetic threats could degrade system performance.  Electromagnetic threats include interception, exploitation, and degradation of commercial and military communication links or the signal environment.  Physical threats can also affect the system to include the entire spectrum of direct and indirect fire weapons, environmental factors, chemical contamination, mishandling, lingering/transitory impacts on the electromagnetic environment, and nuclear destruction.
3.	Shortcomings of Existing Systems.   ?DRAFT as of 30 Aug 02?
Warfighters don?t have seamless information flow across pre-mission, execution and post-mission operations.  Current cockpit information management is heavily dependent on paper media, which is incapable of rapidly presenting data in a manageable and accessible format.  Information presented on paper media is costly to produce, distribute, manage and cannot be integrated or take advantage of advances in technology.  The escalating amount of information on paper hinders situational awareness and safety of flight by increasing ?heads down? time.  
Current onboard information management systems are capability and capacity limited.  Although technology is increasing at a great pace, modifications are expensive and time consuming.  As a result, workaround solutions have been fielded independent of an overall Air Force design philosophy.  While filling a vital need, workarounds are not standardized; can hinder interoperability, have safety implications and run counter to the AEF construct.
4.	Capabilities Required  ?DRAFT as of 30 Aug 02?
GWIS must rapidly exploit technological advances in hardware and software. It must enhance the warfighters ability to manage and organize platform specific operational data, and receive and respond to updates in mission tasking without extensive modifications to weapon systems.
To exploit technological advances, GWIS must rely heavily on the use of current and maturing COTS/GOTS systems to improve warfighter capabilities.  To improve situational awareness, the system must provide current, timely, and relevant mission information.  This requires a system with an accessible, reliable, open architecture and a user-friendly interface.  To enhance current capabilities, the system must aid the warfighter during pre-mission, execution, and post-mission.  
While the following lists are not all-inclusive, they provide examples of capabilities that must be incorporated by spiral development concurrent with technological advances.
Pre-Mission:  GWIS must provide a single point of access to obtain mission information.  Examples of system capabilities include:
?	Gather and update mission specific publications in an intelligent digital format 
?	Gather materials required to perform the mission including those produced by Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS)
?	Give the warfighter the ability to update platform mission data directly 
Execution: The GWIS CDA must maximize situational awareness through spiral development.  Examples of system capabilities include:
?	Provide a moving map display
?	Provide ready access to required in-flight information and publications (FLIP, flight manuals, checklist, etc).
?	Facilitate crew members ability to respond to in-flight mission changes by receiving and presenting mission updates and changes
?	Provide time critical information in response to in-flight emergencies (i.e., charts, checklists, nearest suitable divert/recovery airfields).
?	Store and present required Geospatial products such as charts and imagery
?	Receive and present intelligence updates 
?	Transfer mission information to support assets and flight members
?	Receive target information from multiple sources to include ground, air, and space sources
?	Receive and present any other information that improves situational awareness 
?	Display information in all weather, environmental and lighting conditions
Post-Mission: GWIS will simplify and expedite post mission debrief activities. Examples of system capabilities include: 
?	Provide a mission log to allow for mission reconstruction
?	Provide a record of mission information for post-mission debriefs and Battle Damage Assessment 
5.	Affordability   ?DRAFT as of 30 Aug 02?
GWIS is an evolutionary program that is dependent upon spiral development for affordability and interoperability.  Leveraging COTS/GOTS hardware/software and the present C4ISR architecture will minimize costs.  Spirals will occur as hardware and software improve or the C4ISR architecture changes.    
GWIS lends itself to reduced manpower, training, and sustainment costs through the use of COTS/GOTS hardware and software.  An investment in GWIS will pay dividends immediately with large increases in capabilities and result in long-term savings in production and distribution of paper media.
6.	Scheduling.   ?DRAFT as of 30 Aug 02?
The urgent need for rapidly accessible, integrated mission information demands a short delivery timeline for GWIS.  An evolutionary and spiral based procurement plan will ensure immediate needs are met and ensure future needs are addressed as technology advances.
Table 1 illustrates a notional spiral delivery schedule.  Each spiral will implement improvements in GWIS requirement areas.  The evolutionary nature of technology will drive the definition of further spirals for each requirement area.
7.	Interoperability   ?DRAFT as of 30 Aug 02?
GWIS must have an open systems architecture and support non-proprietary hardware and software interfaces.  CDA Hardware may vary from platform to platform, however GWIS must comply with standard C4I software/hardware interfaces.
8.	Summary.    ?DRAFT as of 30 Aug 02?
The Air Force needs GWIS to harness existing technology and provide timely, accurate, tailored information to enhance mission effectiveness.  GWIS will improve cockpit organization, increase situational awareness, facilitate mission retasking, speed decision-making, and enhance safety.  Spiral development will enable rapid fielding of GWIS with existing technology and provide an affordable approach for continuous improvement.  Today?s warfighter needs GWIS.
