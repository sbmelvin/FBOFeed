<DESC>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Mobility Directorate, C-5 Division (AFLCMC/WLSK) intends to direct the acquisition of supplies identified in this synopsis using Other Than Full and Open Competition (OTF&amp;OC) prescribed by 10 United States Code (U.S.C) 2304(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies and Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. <br /><br />The input from this synopsis will facilitate the award of a new, competitive, Firm Fixed Price contract for the CMC/WxR Production kits, also known as the Production Integration for Modification Award (PIMA).<br /><br />This specific sole source synopsis only applies to the following Group B LRUs: Ballard Technology, Inc (Astronics) for the Video Display Unit (VDU), Mega Industries (Mega) for the Waveguide, and FTG Aerospace, Inc (FTG) for the Public Address (PA) Bunk Panel. The CMC/WxR Production kits are composed of ten Group B Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and Group A brackets, wires, wire harnesses and other consumables. These specific Group B LRUs will be directed subcontracts incorporated into the PIMA contract. <br /><br />A total of 52 CMC/WxR Production kits and initial spares will contain the following quantities from the directed subcontractors: two each VDUs from Ballard; one each PA Bunk Panel from FTG; and one each Waveguide from Mega.<br />The CMC/WxR is an integrated design, utilizing specific software and hardware interfaces, from separate manufacturers/vendors and operates as a homogenous unit. The Government did not purchase, and does not own data rights to, the reproduction and interfacing data for the VDU, Waveguide, or PA Bunk Panel, therefore, the data associated with these Group B components rests exclusively with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). <br /><br />The LRUs supplied by the directed subcontractors during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase are an integral part of the C-5M CMC/WxR baseline configuration. To integrate a replacement component(s) for any or all of the three directed components discussed in this synopsis, would require the Government to re-accomplish all activities and update all documentation previously completed from the Critical Design Review (CDR) through Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E). The level of effort to replace a single component, two components, or all three components, is relatively indistinguishable. In order to transition to Production and meet the required delivery schedule it is necessary to procure the components already approved within the C-5M CMC/WxR product baseline.<br /><br />The Video Display Units (VDUs), developed by Astronics Ballard Technology, Inc., is a C-5M unique component specifically integrated into the C-5M CMC/WxR product baseline during the C-5M CMC/WxR EMD program to interface with the new WXR-2100 receiver transmitter unit and the C-5 legacy multi-function display units (MFDUs). Outputs from the WXR-2100 Receiver/Transmitter are routed through an ARINC 453 to the VDUs and subsequently distributed to each of the four MFDU units within the cockpit. A change to the VDUs already integrated into the CMC/WxR system would require the program office to re-accomplish portions of the critical design review (CDR) relevant to this VDU.<br /><br />The WxR-2100 Waveguide, developed by Mega Industries, LLC, is a C-5M unique component necessary for the low-loss conduction of specific Radio Frequency (RF) energy transfer between the Receiver/Transmitter (RT) unit and the WxR antenna which are separated by several feet. The waveguide is a custom part of specialized materials and geometry to efficiently conduct RF energy at resonant frequencies used by the RT and the WxR antenna. Any action to develop a new Waveguide, would require the program office to re-accomplish portions of the CDR, update the C-5 OSS&amp;E with a new configuration, and re-baseline the airworthiness documentation for the MFR and MTC.
<p>The PA Bunk panel, developed by FTG Aerospace, Inc., is a C-5 unique component which combines two separate unrelated functions into one space-saving small console panel slot which frees up console space for other uses. The PA Bunk panel allows the aircrew to select or de-select the Public Address (PA) function in the aircrew bunk area. The bunk area PA must be de-selected to avoid disturbing required crew rest periods during long-haul flights with crew rotation. The panel also allows for selection of either the upper or lower UHF antenna for line-of-sight communications used by the aircrew. Any alternate component would require integration verification testing, system qualification, and update to the TDP, drawings and technical manuals to meet the C-5 Air Vehicle and Weapon Systems specifications previously accomplished with the existing product baseline.</p>
<p>These commercial components are exclusive to the operations and sustainment of the C-5M aircraft. Each vendor has proprietary drawings, design and manufacturing technical data, and unique test equipment that is required to conduct the level of effort described above for each component (VDU, Waveguide, and PA Bunk Panel). The USAF does not possess or have rights to this data or information required to provide it to a third party. Accordingly, the three subcontractors indicated are the only firms capable of providing the supplies and services described above without the Government experiencing substantial duplication of costs that are unrecoverable through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.<br /><br />If you believe your company is a potential source for the modification to the current VDU, Waveguide or PA Bunk Panel architecture that best meets the attached minimum requirements, then the following criteria are hereby established and all of these criteria are required to be met before the estimated release date of the Request for Proposal on or before 29 Dec 2017:<br /><br />a. Must have access to, or possess, source data for the VDU, Waveguide or PA Bunk Panel. The USAF does not possess or have rights to this information required to provide it to a third party,<br />b. Must have intimate knowledge of the WxR-2100 System and its' operations and integration with the C-5M aircraft drawings,<br />c. Must have access to all technical orders, publications, manuals, and drawings related to the CMC/WxR and to the intellectual property for the C-5M infrastructure such that the company can repair, modify, and upgrade.</p>
<p>Sources responding to this synopsis are required to submit their statement of technical capability, not to exceed 5 pages, addressing the above criteria and attached specifications for this equipment to the Contracting Officer at AFLCMC/WLSK, Attn: Ms. Michelle S. Pickel, 2275 D Street, Bldg 16, Room 127, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7222 or by email to:AFLCMC.WLSK.C5CMCWxR@us.af.mil no later than 5:00PM EST on 01 Dec 17. The approximate date for issuance of the solicitation is 29 Dec 17 with a response date of 27 Feb 18. Since the government intends to direct the source for these specific components as sole source under solicitation FA8625-18-R-6701, no additional synopsis will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. <br /><br />Please contact Ms. Pickel at (937) 656-9540 for additional information and to request copies of the anticipated contract terms and conditions. The clause at AFFARS 5352.201-9001 "Ombudsmen" is applicable.</p>

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-17-00321 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

These reagents will assist the laboratory in validating culture-based CRE assays. Furthermore, the reagents will help to further research efforts of the CDC's Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network. The 50 minute turn-around time of these reagents, paired with the Carba-R kit, is necessary to inform infection control measures for CRE. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.

<DESC>Announcement:

In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAâ€™s 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541330, Engineering Services with a size standard of $15M.

All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 20 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  
  
Background:

The New Entrants Division (ANG-C2) supports the evolution of the National Airspace System (NAS) by integrating research and development (R&D) to refine NAS operational requirements and influence NAS operational improvements and sustainment.

ANG-C2 manages the FAA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Improved Multiple Runway Operations R&D portfolios. This includes program management responsibility for the execution of relevant R&D to support Aviation Safety and NextGen requirements for UAS integration into the NAS, wake separation standards, closely spaced parallel operations, and ground based augmentation system cost benefit studies. This Division manages the FAA's Center of Excellence for UAS as well as the FAA's UAS Pathfinder project for aerial media coverage. Additionally, this Division has a leading role in collaborating with external domestic and international partners, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) to leverage relevant R&D to support the FAA's goals.

The New Entrants Division (ANG-C2) also conceptualizes, investigates, and executes initiatives and capabilities that support transforming the NAS.  This includes separation standards (e.g. wake turbulence). Wake Separation Standards is an area that continues to develop and needs to be investigated, and have appropriate standards, processes and practices defined and subsequently bridged from development to operations. Wake efforts are focused on reducing separation standards between aircraft to increase capacity and efficiency and are being implemented at Charlotte-Douglas Airport, JFK, Newark Liberty, Chicago Oâ€™Hare, Midway, San Francisco, and George Bush Intercontinental and Hobby Airports in Houston.


PURPOSE:

This market survey is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

The work identified is to be provided by means of a combination Firm-Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity type of contract.

Source Selection procedures will be used to select the proposal that provides the lowest price and is technically acceptable to the government. Offerors will be evaluated using the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Method.
 In order to permit efficient competition, the Navy will utilize the following methodology: Proposals will initially be screened for price and placed in order of price (lowest price to highest price). The Navy will then evaluate the technical factors of the three (3) lowest priced proposals. The Navy will make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal from among the three (3) lowest priced proposals. However, if no proposals are found to be technically acceptable within the first group of proposals, the Navy, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to increase the number of proposals it will review, until the Government identifies a technically acceptable proposal.

Accordingly, under this methodology, the technical factors of some proposals may not be evaluated by the Navy.
 If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both technical and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range. Proposers are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms. Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss or revise their proposals. If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both non-price and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range.

The solicitation and resulting contract award will be a performance-based service acquisition made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposals (RFP), will be advantageous to the Government price and other evaluation factors considered.

The offerorâ€™s proposal shall contain a response to each of the evaluation factors and shall be in the form prescribed by the solicitation.
 The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors: Factor 1: Management Approach; Factor 2: Corporate Experience; Factor 3: Technical Solution; Factor 4: Safety; and Factor 5: Past Performance. NOTE: Offerors MUST be evaluated as technically ACCEPTABLE under factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in order to be considered technically acceptable overall.

Offers shall be submitted for the performance of work for the base period and all option periods.

<p><br />A Solicitation will NOT be posted to Fed Biz Opps due to its sole source nature. The draft agreement will be issued directly to DB Controls Corporation on 15 January 2018.</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT - Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement to award a five-year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) for Repair, Upgrade, Rework and Maintenance, Spares and Replenishment, Engineering Support Services, Test and Evaluation, Redesign and Modification, System Training Support, Data Collection, Logistics Support Services, as required. This requirement is in support of a Multi-Mission system used on manned platforms in support of the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA) Program Office PMA-290. Services and support actions consisting of, but not limited to spares, repair actions, calibration, assembly modification, design upgrades, depot piece-part lay-in, engineering support, training services, hardware and software support, and system related logistics services of the Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA) utilized in a Multi-Mission System. Job Orders shall be within scope, issued within ordering period, and be within the maximum total dollar value of approximately $13,500,000 over a five-year period. Each Job Order will be synopsized.</p>
<p>The proposed Agreement is for the supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, DB Control, 1120 Auburn St, Fremont, CA 94538-7328, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)), only one responsible source. The basis for restricting competition is the lack of sufficient technical data and duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. The duplicative cost and delay are comprised from the cost to procure, re-tool, reverse engineer, generate acceptance test procedures, perform first article testing, acquire flight certification, underway for sub-surface platforms, and perform stress analysis, which would take a minimum of three to five years for development, production, and verification.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this draft agreement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact DB Controls Corporation directly.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Offerors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the internet at <a href="https://www.sam.gov">https://www.sam.gov</a>.<br /><br />The anticipated Agreement award date is Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year Eighteen (18). A Solicitation will NOT be posted to Fed Biz Opps due to the sole source nature of the action. The draft Agreement will be issued directly to DB Controls Corporation by 15 January 2018.</p>

The contractor that provides these services must be free from any actual or potential conflicts of interest (COI) in order to provide the Agency with unbiased products, and avoid criticism from Congress and the general public therefore, a number of custom terms will be included in the SOL and all offerors will be required to submit a COI plan describing the offerorÂ¿s system and methods for identifying and either avoiding, neutralizing, or mitigating potential COIs. Core content of several custom terms are provided below.

The Solicitation shall contain the custom provision Sources Excluded from Being Considered For Award, the text of this clause shall provide as follows:

Contractor services resulting from performance of the proposed contract must be free from any actual organizational conflict of interest to ensure the integrity of the work product. The proposed contract requires that the contractor provide services for the development and proliferation of existing and future regulatory compliance and voluntary air quality improvement programs to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) and other OTAQ divisions. The nature of the work proposed under this contract will have a significant impact on policies applicable to certain regulated industries. Firms in these industries cannot avoid, neutralize, or mitigate an actual organizational conflict of interest since performance of the proposed contract will necessarily impact the course of their, or their competitors', business.

Therefore, the following sources are excluded from consideration for award: all large-volume and small-volume automotive manufacturers, all on-road and non-road engine and vehicle manufacturers, all petroleum companies (oil refiners, fuel distributers, and fuel sellers), and any firms whose primary business involves the manufacture, sale, or resale of emission testing equipment (including IM240 equipment) The specific determination whether any other offeror is to be considered ineligible for award will be made by the Agency on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the guidance provided in FAR Subpart 9.5.


The solicitation shall contain the custom local provision Disclosure Requirements for Organizational Conflicts of Interest (EPA-L-09-102) Paragraph (a) and (c) of the clause shall provide as follows: 

Paragraph a: The proposed contract requires that the contractor provide the Office of Air and Radiation, (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) with services for various data analyses, modeling, and other related research activities related to motor vehicle emissions. The offeror shall specifically disclose whether it has any business or financial relationships with all large-volume and small-volume automotive manufacturers, all on-road and non-road engine and vehicle manufacturers, all petroleum companies (oil refiners, fuel distributers, and fuel sellers), and any firms whose primary business involves the manufacture, sale, or resale of emission testing equipment (including IM240 equipment) and/or whether it is performing any work that potentially conflicts with work under this contract for EPA.

Paragragh c: The Agency has determined that offerors directly engaged in or which have a business or a financial relationship(s) with entities involved in the activities described in paragraph (a) above (hereinafter referred to as "these activities") may have significant potential organizational conflicts of interest in relation to the requirements of this solicitation. In addition, a potential organizational conflict of interest may exist with offerors that provide consulting and/or technical services related to these activities.


It is expected that the solicitation and resultant contract will include a Â¿LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING.Â¿ Clause. The text of this clause will mirror the clause Limitation of Future Contracting, Alternate V (Headquarters Support), (EPAAR 1552.209-74), (APR 2004), except for paragraph (c). Paragraph (c) of the clause shall read as follows:

Unless prior written approval is obtained from the EPA Contracting Officer, the contractor agrees not to enter into any financial or business relationships or to represent any party, other than the EPA, with respect to the activities performed under this contract.  Specifically, the contractor may not enter into a business or financial relationship with any affected entities that may be affected by regulations, standards, criteria, guidelines, or policies that are based on data that may be produced under this contract, if the purpose of the financial or business relationship is to contest, oppose, or otherwise influence such regulations, standards, criteria, guidelines, or policies, or to avoid or circumvent their applicability. These restrictions apply for the life of the contract.

The solicitation is subject to full and open competition, all responsible offerors may submit a proposal.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services) with a size standard of $15 million.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be available in early December with a close date approximately 30 days thereafter.  Contract award will be made in accordance wth FAR part 15 Contracting by Negotiation.  The point of contact is Clare Hingsbergen, Contract Specialist, 513-487-2503, Hingsbergen.clare@epa.gov.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice.  Network Contracting Office (NCO 21) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to result in a single-award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) for temporary medical staffing for each health care system   one for VA San Francisco Medical Center (SFVAMC) and one for VA Northern California Health Care System (VANCHCS).   

Statement of Need:
The purpose of this acquisition is to provide contracting support for temporary medical staffing needs for both SFVAMC and VANCHCS.  Both medical centers require contractor support to supplement their staffing with respect to Critical Care Registered Nurses (RN), Med/Surgery Registered Nurses (RN), Chronic Hemodialysis Nurses (RN), Radiology Nurses (RN), Post Anesthesia Care Unit Nurses, Operating Room Nurses, Emergency Room (RN), Chemotherapy Nurses, Licensed Practical/Vocational Nurses (LPN/LVN), Nursing Assistants (NA), Nurse Practitioners (NP), Monitor Technicians, Instrument Technicians, Surgical Technicians, SPS Technicians, and Medical Support Assistants to augment in-house staffing.  

This is a per diem staffing requirement.  In other words, the requirement is on a random, as-needed basis.  Before utilizing contractor support for VA staffing the VA will use its own VA intermittent employees.  Consequently, most of the contractor support is not scheduled in advance and is required within up to 24 hours of notice.  As a result, it requires an extensive pool of candidates from each of the required labor categories to meet the needs on a random, unscheduled basis.  Moreover, all candidates must successfully pass a background check and be approved through the VA s credentialing process that can take anywhere from several weeks to a few months.  

Interested offerors will be required to submit at least 50 or more candidates for each health care system with the proposal submission to include the employee s name, their place of residence, their start date with the offeror, a copy of their license, and an indication as to which facility(ies) they are available to work.     

Additionally, since both health care systems are Joint Commission Accredited, the interested offerors should identify if they are certified with Joint Commission as a temporary medical staffing firm and provide a copy of the certification.

Solicitation:
The anticipated release date will be in December 2017 with proposals due in early January 2018.  The NAICS is 561320 Temporary Help Services with the size standard of $27.5M.  The Product Service Code is Q401 Medical   Nursing.  Interested offerors should continuously check FBO (www.fbo.gov) for the solicitation.  This requirement will be set-aside as a total small business set-aside.  Limitations on Subcontracting will apply.

All questions must be submitted by email to felicia.demita@va.gov .  No telephone questions will be accepted.

<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Notice is being issued for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the USDA, ARS.<br /><br />ARS is conducting a Market Survey to identify the availability and interest of Building Automation Control System (BACS) manufacturers as potential sources for a portion of the NLAE Renovation Project located in Ames, Iowa. It is the intent of the Government to replace DDC control panels and programming as part of the larger renovation effort. Both the panels and the programming must be compatible with the Johnson Controls DDC system but not necessarily Johnson Controls brand name items.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 334290 Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing with a Size Standard of 750 employees.<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />The USDA, ARS NLAE was constructed in 1986 as the National Soil Tilth Laboratory on the Iowa State University (ISU) campus. The HVAC and related systems were Johnson Controls (JCI) pneumatic controls and operated the building HVAC systems, heat recovery systems, growth and root environmental control chamber systems, and room HVAC controls for laboratories, offices, and support spaces. The JCI equipment also monitors security, fire, and central utilities provided from the campus systems and alarms are reported to the ISU campus security and/or building automation controls group.<br /><br />Roughly 20 years ago the ISU facilities group began replacing pneumatic systems and controls with JCI Direct Digital Controls (DDC) and NLAE pneumatic systems that failed were also upgraded to the current campus standard, which is now JCI Metasys operating on the Extended Architecture platform. The ISU building automation controls group provides automation service management for the NLAE automation systems and maintains the JCI system software on their servers. The NLAE building manager is authorized to assess to the campus BAS to monitor, trend, adjust building automation set-points in the NLAE building. The control programming for the building resides in a combination of local controllers and the JCI Metasys servers outside of the building, where it is also backed up. The building JCI controls are connected to the campus servers via a dedicated Ethernet connection. ISU maintains the expertise to manage and program the JCI Metasys EA system for all campus buildings (more than one hundred), including NLAE.<br /><br />Project Scope:<br /><br />At the completion of this project, all of the pneumatic controls in NLAE will have been converted to JCI Metasys control that will conform to the ISU standards for building automation, assuring USDA will retain the current relationship with ISU to monitor and support the existing building automation systems in the building and to be able to provide back-up service without USDA purchasing additional hardware, software, and/or requirements to provide additional specialized training to USDA or ISU personnel.<br /><br />The programming and hardware for the project generally includes HVAC systems, including VAV box controllers, VFD controllers, pump controllers, thermostats humidistats, fume hood controls, fans for supply, return, exhaust, and heat recovery, steam actuators, chilled water control valves and chilled water control systems for plant growth and root (rhizotron) environmental growth chambers. All points will be programmed into the central campus building automation system and configured in accordance with the ISU Building Automation Standards. All hardware will be fully compatible with the ISU requirements.<br /><br />The building automation system costs, which are part of the overall contract,&nbsp;are estimated to be approximately twenty percent (20%) of the NLAE renovation project which has a magnitude of construction of over $10,000,000. The proposed construction at NLAE will be performed on an active research facility. <br /><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. Interested firms are invited to respond to this announcement by providing the following information:<br />1. Firm's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address.<br />2.

<p>&emsp;<br />ATTENTION small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort:</p>
<p>No set aside decision has been made; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  The clause reads, in part, as follows:  "Limitations on Subcontracting (Nov 2011) ... (c) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction).  At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern... ".  Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.</p>
<p>If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>ATTENTION all potential respondents:</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy for this program has not been finalized. If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract maybe based off a brand name.</p>
<p>Part II. Capability Survey Questions</p>
<p>1.	Is your firm registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), formally known as Central Contractor Registration (CCR)? In accordance with federal regulations, all contractors doing business with the federal government must be registered in the SAM database.</p>
<p>2.	Describe briefly the capabilities of the nature of the services you provide.</p>
<p>3.	Describe your company's past experience on previous with similar services.  Include contract numbers, a brief description of the work performed, period of performance, agency/organization supported, and individual point of contact (Contracting Officer or Program Manager).</p>
<p>4.	Are there specific requirements in the documentation that we provide that would currently preclude your product/service from being a viable solution to our requirement?</p>
<p>5.	Are there established market prices for our requirement?  If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public?  Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions?  Briefly describe any differences.</p>
<p>If your company is interested, e-mail your responses to joy.hyde@us.af.mil. E-mail responses should be received no later than 4 days after the issuance of this notice.  Direct and sufficient responses are preferred.  Marketing materials are considered an insufficient response.

<DESC>U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Orlando, Florida<br />Sources Sought Notice<br />For<br />Special Operations Forces (SOF) Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal (RAPTOR) IV
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>ACC - Orlando, Florida has a requirement to support the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Product Manager (PM) SOF Training Systems (STS) in procuring Engineering Support Services (ESS), Training Services, and Research and Development (R&amp;D) efforts in support of expanding the existing SOF RAPTOR effort currently identified on the SOF RAPTOR III contract. SOF RAPTOR IV requirement will include means for conducting live, virtual and constructive training services, training requirements analysis, concept exploration, advanced concept exploration, rapid prototype development, and operation and maintenance functions to support United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and its component commands: United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM), Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC), and Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and other national assets. The new effort is intended to support USSOCOM programs and agencies that directly interface operationally with USSOCOM.</p>
<p>Contract/Program Background</p>
<p>This requirement is a follow-on requirement to the W900KK-14-D-0001 SOF RAPTOR III single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract, currently being performed by RAPTOR Training Services, LLC. CAGE Code 6E9K9. The associated Product/Supply Code (PSC) is R425 and NAICS code 541330 are applicable. The single award ID/IQ contract, awarded in February 2014 with a ceiling of $98.9 Million, is due to expire February 2019. The SOF RAPTOR III contract replaced the SOF RAPTOR I and II contract requirements. The SOF RAPTOR I contract was comprised of efforts that were 100% Engineering Services, whereas the SOF RAPTOR II and SOF RAPTOR III contracts were a mix of Engineering Services, Training Services, and R&amp;D efforts supporting numerous objectives of USSOCOM, USASOC, AFSOC, NAVSPECWARCOM, MARSOC, JSOC, and other national assets.</p>
<p>General Requirements</p>
<p>SOF RAPTOR services include SOF training support, engineering support, and national asset training support efforts as described in the introduction. SOF training includes dynamic planning, rehearsals, and training execution in non-standard environments. This typically has numerous coordinated components including maritime, air, military freefall and intelligence as well as professional role players. Engineering support includes all disciplines and typically involves applying SOF unique requirements to existing devices, equipment etc. to create an enhanced SOF unique capability. National asset training typically includes similar components as SOF training; however, includes more staff training components and is rarely performed in or near military installations. National assets training requires detailed scripting, exercise development, target coordination, inter-agency replication and extensive Tier I/II experience. SOF RAPTOR IV will provide a vehicle that incorporates the scope of the SOF RAPTOR III contract and will be expanded to include additional scope and tasks that will support additional elements of mission preparedness and mission training. Mission preparedness, rehearsal, and training include primarily SOF tasks and include the joint community that USSOCOM operates and interfaces with, such as NATO Special Forces partners and other national Government assets and agencies.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking an industry partner(s) that can provide elite training support to the nation's most elite SOF Warriors. It is anticipated that this SOF RAPTOR IV requirement will be solicited as a single award, ID/IQ Firm-Fixed-Price type task order contract with a 7-year ordering period, a contract ceiling of approximately $350 Million.</p>
<p>Submission Details</p>
<p>Responses should be succinct, but sufficient in detail to adequately demonstrate the required capability to meet the Government's stated requirements. The Government intends to utilize the data collected from this announcement to determine a procurement strategy. Potential strategies could range from a small-business set aside to one of the socio-economic contracting programs in FAR part 19. Interested parties are requested to provide your written capabilities statement package to this announcement consisting of the following:</p>
<p>1. Information about your company:<br />a. Name and address of company<br />b. Cage Code<br />c. Ownership (Joint Venture, DBA, partnership, etc.)<br />d. Names of two principals to contact, including title, telephone number, and email address<br />e. Statement regarding its current Small Business Administration (SBA) business size and socio-economic classification under NAICS code 541330 (Small Business Size Standard $38.5 Million).</p>
<p>2. Does your firm have experience with the following type of support:<br />a. Engineering and standard support services<br />b. Training services<br />c. Research and Development<br />d. Conducting live, virtual and constructive training services<br />e. Training requirement analysis<br />f. Standard and advanced concept exploration<br />g. Rapid prototype development<br />h. Operation and maintenance functions<br />i. Mission preparedness, rehearsal, and training in support of SOF tasks</p>
<p>NOTE: Where applicable, include the following information:<br />a. Government contract number;<br />b. Contract value;<br />c. Role your company played;<br />d. Point of contact and telephone number.</p>
<p>4. Please demonstrate that your company has the necessary organization, accounting and operational controls, financial resources, technical skills and qualifications to ensure the successful performance of the tasks?</p>
<p>5. Has your company managed a team of subcontractors before?</p>
<p>6. Provide an explanation of your company's ability to perform 50% of the work with company resources versus support from subcontractor.</p>
<p>7. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to achieve the requirements, address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements.</p>
<p>8. It is expected that the new SOF RAPTOR IV effort will not have funding to cover overarching Program Management functions, outside of individual Task Orders.<br />a. Describe your approach in supporting short fused time sensitive Task Order requirements that require execution within a 30 - 45 day window. This includes the ability to provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) on cost, schedule, and performance with expedient turnaround times.<br />b. Describe your ability to operate in an Integrated Product Team (IPT) environment with the Government and/or its customer, and how your program management is structured to meet very short timelines to make decisions, meet documentation and programmatic suspense's, etc.<br />c. Describe your approach to managing the overall contract, subcontracts, and individual task orders. Differentiate your approach between a Task Order that is complex and program management intensive versus an order that would be a Commercial off-the Shelf (COTS) procurement.</p>
<p>9. There could be instances where a significant surge of program management efforts (proposal preparation, IPT coordination, etc.) is required. These surges could be random and without notice, yet require a quick turnaround (i.e. 4th quarter of the fiscal year). Identify your process for staffing and processing multiple proposals, while still managing current efforts. Describe your ability to surge to meet demands.</p>
<p>10. What barriers, if any, would prevent your company from submitting a proposal for this requirement?</p>
<p>Contractors are requested to provide a capability response not exceeding fifteen (15) 8.5 x 11 inch pages, including the cover sheet. Font size shall not be smaller than 11-point. All capability statements shall be submitted in Microsoft Word or Portable Document Format (PDF).

<DESC>The primary purpose of this contract is to advance scientific and technical knowledge and apply that knowledge to the extent necessary to achieve agency and national goals. The U.S Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program is a national program responsible for collecting, analyzing, reporting, and distributing information and data about the extent, content, and condition of the Nation's rural and urban forests as well as how much forest land exists and who owns it. FIA's research emphasis is on achieving specified objectives and knowledge rather than on achieving predetermined end results prescribed in a statement of specific performance characteristics. Crew leaders who complete this work will be working independently without a Forest Service employee present except for on a few hot checks. The US Forest Service will not direct the daily work assignments completed by crew leaders.
<p><br />There are four FIA Units nationally with the Northern Research Station's FIA unit having the responsibility for the comprehensive forest and urban inventory for 24 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. National, state, and local policymakers, universities, businesses, Tribal governments, National Forest managers, other natural resource agencies, and various interest groups depend on FIA for timely, scientifically credible information about our forests and urban landscape.</p>
<p>FIA inventory plots are randomly located throughout the NRS FIA Region with the vast majority of plots occurring on private ownership. Determining ownership of plot locations and gaining permission from landowners to complete the inventory is critical to the success of the project. In some cases more than one owner may need to be contacted to access a plot, this is especially true in urban settings. Communication skills and the ability to work independently are essential requirements of the work.</p>
<p>Use of aerial photography, other imagery, maps, and previous FIA plot records will be necessary to accurately locate FIA plot locations and collect forest inventory resource data. This work requires regular and recurring physical exertion in the form of travel on foot over rough, uneven, and steep terrain. This work requires several hours of driving, several days each week with work locations changing frequently, often on a daily basis. Work areas may range from an urban environment to a remote wilderness area and everything else in between. The urban environment involves working in commercial, residential, and&nbsp; FIA plots are located across the entire contract area and overnight travel to access and complete many of the inventory plots in this contract will be a necessary. Access to some plots may require the use of watercraft as well as coordination with other public and private agencies. <br />Additional NRS FIA program information can be found at: <br />&bull; http://fia.fs.fed.us/<br />&bull; http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/fia/.<br />&bull; http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/fia/data-collection/ <br />Additional NRS Urban FIA program information can be found at:<br />&bull; http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/fia/urban/.<br />&bull; http://www.fs.fed.us/research/urban/fia.</p>
<p>In Accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation part 35.007 Research and Development Contracting Solicitation,&nbsp;the submission and evaluation of an inordinate number of R&amp;D proposals from sources lacking appropriate qualifications is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, the Contracting Officer will&nbsp;only&nbsp;provide the solicitation to&nbsp;sources technically qualified to perform.<br /><br />Potential sources&nbsp;will be&nbsp;qualified, as a result of:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Present and past performance of similar work;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Professional stature and reputation;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Relative position in a particular field of endeavor;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Ability to acquire and retain the professional and technical capability, including facilities, required to perform the work; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Other relevant factors.<br /><br /><strong>Contractors <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MUST</span> respond to this Sources Sought Notice with the attached Experience Questionnaire</strong> for the Government to evaluate the technical qualifications of the offeror.</p>
<p>The Solicitation for Blanket Purchase Agreements that will be used to support the work described above will ONLY be DISTRIBUTED to those contractors found minimally technically qualified by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Once a contractor is determined to be Technically Qualified, the solicitation will be released to that offeror.</p>
<p>Once the offeror responds to the solicitation other&nbsp;evaluations will be made to&nbsp;determine more specific technical abilities, those evaluations may include contractor testing.</p>
<p>If the contractor is found to be Technically Qualified, they will be awarded a five-year Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). The Government anticipates making multiple awards. Contractors awarded these BPAs shall constitute the Forest Inventory Analysis, BPA Suite that future requirements shall be competed amongst.</p>
<p>Entry to the FIA BPA Suite is based entirely on technical qualifications of the contractor, and may include individual staff members in key positions.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notice will be posted for two (2) months, the solicitation will be issued as it is available, and contractors will be awarded a BPA as they are found technically competetent.&nbsp; This will result in multiple BPAs being awarded at different times, on different days.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Of the various analytical methods available to the Division of Preclinical Inovation (DPI) medicinal chemists at the National Center for Advancingg Transliational Sciences (NCATS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), NMR is arguably the most important for structure verification and purity validation. Easy access to well organized NMR data is an imperative to maintain productivity in the successful pursuit of the DPI, and by extension, the NCATS mission. As such, installation of an NMR database, which is compatible with the NMR processing software utilized at DPI is a necessity.  Since 2006, medicinal chemists at DPI have been acquiring NMR data for all internally synthesized compounds, as well as selected compounds of interest purchased from external sources. The growth of the Center (NCGC to NCTT to NCATS) over the years has led to a proportional expansion of the medicinal chemistry group, which has correlated to a significant increase in the number of NMR spectra obtained. This collected NMR data is currently processed utilizing Mnova software platform from Mestrelabs, Inc. While the collected FIDs are stored in a centralized share drive, the Fourier transformed spectra are only saved in the local database of the individual chemists. Due to the large and ever growing number of NMR spectra generated by the DPI medicinal chemistry group, the need for a centralized NMR database is of high importance for several reasons. First, the processed NMR spectra saved on each chemist's computer is not available for use by other chemists. This can lead to redundancy in experimental efforts as the medicinal chemists are unaware of all existing analytical data, which can lead to a significant loss in time, resources, and money. Second, there is no uniformity for data storage within the individual databases, which is highly inefficient. Even if a chemist was to gain access to another chemist's NMR data, they would not know how to find a desired NMR spectrum or specified data across a set of NMR spectra assuming that data is even stored. Third, the processed NMR spectra of each chemist are not currently backed up. A computer failure for any of the medicinal chemists would lead to a loss of this data, which in some instances cannot be reacquired as we no longer have the compound. A significant investment of time would be needed to reacquire the data for compounds that are available. Saving the NMR spectra in a centralized database, which is regularly backed up, would ensure the safety of this highly important and irreplaceable data. By implementing the Mnova DB plugin for the storage, organization, and management of all processed NMR experiments, we would see a reduction in wasted time, effort, and resources by the DPI medicinal group. This would significantly increase the efficiency and productivity of the research conducted at DPI.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the University of California San Diego (USCD) for the purchase of 400 Certified Reference Material (CRM) bottles for the analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for Atlantic Oceanographic &amp; Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) in Miami, FL.
<p>Justification for Sole Source<br />The certified reference materials are produced at the UCSD. These DIC CRMs are the only ones used by the research community worldwide to achieve high precision measurements and inter-comparable results for NOAA's Global Carbon Program.</p>
<p>These CRMs are for scientific research only and not for commercial use and not for sale outside the scientific community. A major goal of modern oceanography is the coordinated study of oceanic processes on a global scale. The impetus comes from a desire to understand the factors that control climate and how climate changes affect biogeochemical systems.</p>
<p>Twenty thousand bottles of reference materials have now been distributed to a wide variety of laboratories both within the United States and in 19 other countries. They are used extensively to confirm that instruments are performing properly and to ensure measurement compatibility.</p>
<p>These CRM's are used to determine the stability of AOML's instruments and to correct the data after analyses are complete. The harm to the government would be millions of dollars of useless data if the CRM's from the UCSD were not used. The data that AOML collects would not be comparable or used by the rest of the research community if a different CRM for DIC in seawater did exist and was used by AOML. Data comparison would be effected by using a different CRM because it would be different from which all others in the research community were using to calibrate their instruments and correct their data with, making our data unusable or questionable at best. The DIC-CRM's from UCSD are essential and critical to the mission of the government to provide high quality comparable dissolved organic carbon (DIC) data within the government and research communities. This DIC CRM is special because it has been developed by UCSD over the last couple of decades and collected from the North Pacific Ocean. It has been used by everyone in the global ocean carbon community to calibrate their instruments and to correct their DIC data, which makes eveyone's data comparable to everyone else's.</p>
<p>Sources Sought<br />This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the software may submit substantiating documentation in writing within ten days of this notice. Responses can be sent via e-mail to anthony.ciolli@noaa.gov. Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>DOC, Eastern Region Acquisition Division requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). No award can be made to a company not registered in SAM. For additional information and to register in SAM, please access the following web site: www.sam.gov.

<p>Background and Scope of Work <br />Jewel Cave National Monument is located in the Black Hills Region of South Dakota within Custer County. The Monument, created in 1908 by Theodore Roosevelt under the Antiquities Act of 1906, was established to preserve the Jewel Cave Ecosystem for its scientific interests and for public enjoyment. The park is visited by approximately 140,000 visitors annually with<br />an average of 80,000 actually touring the cave. To enable public access to the cave system, the National Park Service (NPS) conducts regular tours via a constructed route that is approximately one-half mile long. The route consists of stairs, bridges, platforms, and concrete trails that were built of aluminum and concrete in the late 1960s to early 1970s, before the existence of modern building and safety codes. Further, the route was built in an ad hoc manner that makes the structures difficult to maintain and repair, and doesn't adequately address safety concerns from slips, trips, and falls. Additionally, the makeshift methods for cleaning the structures and removing debris are inefficient, and also pose safety risks of their own. The terrain in the cave "off trail" is steep, rocky, and poses a hazard to construction workers who will be working on and around the structures. See https://www.nps.gov/jeca/index.htm for more information on Jewel Cave National Monument.</p>
<p>The scope of this project requires demolition and subsequent construction (or refurbishment) of select trail features and supporting elements to provide safe access for visitors touring Jewel Cave. The existing facilities to be replaced or refurbished include over 1,550 square feet of aluminum platform grating, approximately 720 aluminum stair treads, 2,750 linear feet of aluminum guardrail/handrail, and 820 square feet of aluminum bridge structures. New construction will include replacing the demolished elements described above with new stainless steel components. New construction also includes the installation of approximately 2,300 linear feet of concrete curbing and 1,000 square feet of concrete sidewalk. This project will also require that select upgrades be made to the existing electrical system to support new lighting installations included in this work.</p>
<p>All work will be performed in a highly sensitive, subterranean environment necessitating a high level of effort to ensure the protection of irreplaceable natural resources. Protection of resources during construction will be of paramount concern.</p>
<p>Capabilities Statement: <br />Your capabilities statement shall be submitted as an electronic file (in .pdf format) attached to your email. Your capabilities statement shall be formatted to legibly print in 8-1/2"x11" size. <br />Your capabilities statement shall be no longer than 10 pages.</p>

<p>Background and Scope of Work <br />Jewel Cave National Monument is located in the Black Hills Region of South Dakota within Custer County. The Monument, created in 1908 by Theodore Roosevelt under the Antiquities Act of 1906, was established to preserve the Jewel Cave Ecosystem for its scientific interests and for public enjoyment. The park is visited by approximately 140,000 visitors annually with<br />an average of 80,000 actually touring the cave. To enable public access to the cave system, the National Park Service (NPS) conducts regular tours via a constructed route that is approximately one-half mile long. The route consists of stairs, bridges, platforms, and concrete trails that were built of aluminum and concrete in the late 1960s to early 1970s, before the existence of modern building and safety codes. Further, the route was built in an ad hoc manner that makes the structures difficult to maintain and repair, and doesn't adequately address safety concerns from slips, trips, and falls. Additionally, the makeshift methods for cleaning the structures and removing debris are inefficient, and also pose safety risks of their own. The terrain in the cave "off trail" is steep, rocky, and poses a hazard to construction workers who will be working on and around the structures. See https://www.nps.gov/jeca/index.htm for more information on Jewel Cave National Monument.</p>
<p>The scope of this project requires demolition and subsequent construction (or refurbishment) of select trail features and supporting elements to provide safe access for visitors touring Jewel Cave. The existing facilities to be replaced or refurbished include over 1,550 square feet of aluminum platform grating, approximately 720 aluminum stair treads, 2,750 linear feet of aluminum guardrail/handrail, and 820 square feet of aluminum bridge structures. New construction will include replacing the demolished elements described above with new stainless steel components. New construction also includes the installation of approximately 2,300 linear feet of concrete curbing and 1,000 square feet of concrete sidewalk. This project will also require that select upgrades be made to the existing electrical system to support new lighting installations included in this work.</p>
<p>All work will be performed in a highly sensitive, subterranean environment necessitating a high level of effort to ensure the protection of irreplaceable natural resources. Protection of resources during construction will be of paramount concern.</p>
<p>Capabilities Statement: <br />Your capabilities statement shall be submitted as an electronic file (in .pdf format) attached to your email. Your capabilities statement shall be formatted to legibly print in 8-1/2"x11" size. <br />Your capabilities statement shall be no longer than 10 pages.</p>
<p>Your capabilities statement shall include the following information: <br />&bull;Your contact information and DUNS number.<br />&bull;A statement as to your socioeconomic status [8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, WOSB, EDWOSB, Small, other].<br />&bull;Park and Project # (JECA-219033)<br />&bull;A letter from your bonding company verifying your current bonding levels.</p>
<p>Your capabilities statement shall respond to each of the following 7 capability criteria and demonstrate your firm's ability to successfully perform the specific scope of work described above. <br />1. Ability to keep workers safe on this dangerous project <br />2. Ability to manage complex logistics required of this unique project<br />3. Ability to field engineer, fabricate and install the stainless steel components <br />4. Ability to construct concrete curbs and walkways<br />5. Ability to protect sensitive (irreplaceable) natural resources in the cave<br />6. Ability to acquire the materials, labor and equipment as would be needed for this project<br />7. Ability to complete the project within the performance period<br />8. Ability to complete the project within the performance period</p>

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

The purpose of this sources sought is to describe the requirement for the installation of a Close Quarter Combat Recording (CQCR) system in all new facilities constructed as part of an expansion of the Small Arms Testing and Evaluation Complex (SATEC) Special Operations Urban Complex (SOUC) training range.  The second phase of construction will involve the addition of six new â€œtargetâ€ buildings and a Range Control Building.
  All buildings will require the installation of numerous audio, visual, lighting, and special-effects items that must be properly integrated into the rangeâ€™s existing CQCR system.   The CQCR is a highly specialized system of interdependent, specialized cameras and controls that incorporate integrated Hollywood-type special effects and High-Risk Training (HRT) safety controls.  This system has been designed to control the technical equipment required to provide realistic combat simulations replicating those encountered by Special Operations Forces (SOF) in high-threat environments as well as record the performance of training participants. 

The CQCR system operates all of the rangeâ€™s audio, visual, and special-effects components via a graphic human-machine interface created using a software program called Wonderware.
  The system also utilizes numerous Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) units that serve to control the actual functioning of one or more technical components.  Only manufacturer-authorized integrators have access to the PLC software that allows the various components to communicate with the Wonderware SCADA program.  The equipment currently used at the SATEC SOUC, required to be integrated into to, intended for use in the proposed expansion includes:

â€¢  Networked audio system (manufactured by Digigram) 
â€¢  Lighting (controlled by Allen-Bradley controllers)
â€¢  Video control system (Pelco)
â€¢  IED simulators (Allen-Bradley)
â€¢  Environmental control / scent systems (Allen-Bradley)
â€¢  Proprietary Range/shooting targets (Strategic Systems, Inc.)

THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.
 It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential small business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of an award. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. It is requested that interested SMALL businesses submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 15 pages total) demonstrating the ability to perform the requested services.  

Interested Sources are invited to respond to this Source Sought by completing Attachment 1 â€“ Company Information and Attachment 2 â€“ Technical Information.

The Capabilities Statement Package shall not exceed 5 pages and shall ONLY be submitted electronically to Barbara Williamson-Garris, Barbara.williamson@navy.mil and MUST be limited to a 4Mb attachment.
 You are encouraged to request a read receipt or acknowledgement via reply email.

RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 21 2017 AT 4:00 PM EASTERN.  LATE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.

<DESC><div>FHFA is requesting information from interested sources and this request is for information only, and your response is neither an offer nor a quote. Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals or quotes and will not accept unsolicited proposals or quotes. This request for information does not commit the FHFA to pay any costs incurred in the preparation and submission to this RFI.&nbsp; Also, this RFI does not obligate FHFA to contract for multifamily commercial property data or guarantee any respondent inclusion on a potential solicitation mailing list. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in a future solicitation, if one is issued.&nbsp;</div>
<div>FHFA is an independent regulatory agency responsible for the oversight of vital components of the secondary mortgage markets-the housing government sponsored enterprises of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System. FHFA is the conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA anticipates, if this develops into a firm requirement, a solicitation MAY be issued in January 2018.</div>
<div>Purpose<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>FHFA has a potential requirement for multifamily commercial property data.&nbsp; FHFA Division of Enterprise Regulation uses internal and external data to analyze the overall multifamily sector as well as multifamily loan activity at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&nbsp; To support this analysis, FHFA is seeking commercial sources capable of providing&nbsp; multifamily data that contain nationwide property level data including, but not limited to, new supply (may include construction planned or in process), rent (including concessions), vacancy rates, rent comparables, capitalization rates, net operating income, and property value.&nbsp; The data should include both current and historical time series data.&nbsp; The data should be compatible with Tableau software.</div>
<div><br />FHFA is conducting market research to gain an understanding on the possibility to obtain this data.&nbsp; &nbsp;Based on positive market research results, FHFA may formulate a subsequent procurement strategy and solicitation.&nbsp;<br /><br /> Sources Sought: This RFI is seeking responses from vendors to address the following.</div>
<div><br />1.&nbsp; Gauge overall vendor interest in this FHFA requirement.</div>
<div><br />2.&nbsp; Identify the capabilities of potential sources, including those with current GSA federal schedule contracts.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />3.&nbsp; Gather information that can be used to inform, formulate, and enhance a procurement strategy and solicitation.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Information and Input Requested</div>
<div><br />&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A letter of interest, including a point of contact, phone number, and email.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A brief overview of your firm's capabilities that addresses the above listed potential requirements.</div>
<div>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Your firm&rsquo;s size status for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number: 519130 &ndash; Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals.&nbsp; If you are uncertain of your size status, please see the Small Business Administration&rsquo;s site for more details:&nbsp; http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Please include an estimate (rough order of magnitude) price associated with how your firm price access to this data.</div>
<div>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Please do not exceed seven pages.&nbsp; However, your firm may submit any pre-created marketing literature to supplement the requirement.</div>
<div>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Is your firm a GSA schedule holder or Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC)?&nbsp; If so, include contract number, and Government POC name, phone, and email.</div>
<div><br />If this does become a firm requirement, and the FHFA decides to request a proposal or quote from your firm, you will be advised.</div>
<div><br />Please do NOT include any non-disclosure restrictions; state your submission is for evaluation purposes only; or submit other similar restrictions.&nbsp; FHFA is conducting market research and may share your inputs with others to develop a potential, future solicitation.&nbsp; Such restrictions eliminate that utility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Please submit a response to this RFI by email to Deirdre.Eischens@fhfa.gov on or before 4PM, Thursday, November 30, 2017.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Questions or requests for clarification may be made to me at 202-649-3783 or via email at Deirdre.Eischens@fhfa.gov.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />FHFA appreciates your time in responding to this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<p>The Department of Labor, Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) requires expert transition and management support to enable the department and its sub-agencies and offices to successfully transition telecommunications services off of expiring contracts and onto new contracts, which will be issued under four master task orders. Under this proposed contract, the Contractor shall provide management services for the OCIO Transition Program Office which will be overseeing task orders awarded by DOL on the GSA EIS contract. These management services will aid the OCIO Transition Program Office in transitioning, obtaining, and maintaining proper contract administration and management controls of the task orders issued under the master GSA contract.</p>
<p>This effort is a new effort. There is no incumbent. This&nbsp;requirment is total small business set aside.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> <br />Prior telecommunications acquisitions have traditionally followed a similar path or acquisition of services, utilizing broad scoped GWAC's such as FTS2000, FTS2001, Networx, WITS and other GSA vehicles. The next iteration of these GSA contracts will be a large multiple award IDIQ contract; Enterprise Infrastructure Services (EIS). DOL currently uses these expiring GSA contracts for a large portion of the Department-wide telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for the Telecommunications Transition and Management Support. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government for forming a binding contract.</p>
<p>This RFI is a request for interested parties to describe their technical capabilities and demonstrated experience with services and support necessary to plan and execute the transition of services from OCIO's expiring local and long distance contracts to new contracts. The expiring contracts include but are not limited to Networx Universal, Networx Enterprise, WITS3, GSA Regional Services, other GSA Local Services Arrangements and other contracts that are currently acquired under agency specific contracts.</p>
<p>All interested contractors are requested to provide written response to the questions and potential task areas provided below. All small businesses to include Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, and Women-Owned and service Disabled are strongly encouraged to provide timely response to this Request for Information (RFI). A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist DOL in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to provide the required services. In addition, this information will also be used to assist DOL in establishing a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract/small business participation plan and/or small business goal percentages.</p>
<p>a) Describe your experience in providing support of overall planning and scheduling of transition and development of transition schedules.</p>
<p>b) Describe your experience in supporting the Department and sub-agency program office(s) in developing acquisition plans and executing the plans to acquire replacement services under new contracts.</p>

<p>The small business size standard for this NAICS Code is 541620 for Environmental Consulting Services. The small business size standard for this NAICS is $15 million, and the Project Service Code is B599 for Other Special Studies &amp; Analyses.<br /><br />The Period of Performance is anticipated for a maximum of 3 years (multi-year) starting approximately&nbsp;June 2018.<br /><br />The estimated price range for this project is approximately $150,000.00 to $350,000.00 per year.<br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), San Francisco District is required to determine the extent of eelgrass/seagrass in and around the federal navigation channels and monitor impacts to this resource during dredging that occurs within the San Francisco Bay and central coast of California before and after each proposed maintenance episode (e.g. Richmond Inner Harbor and Oakland Harbor in the San Francisco Bay and Bodega Bay and Noyo Harbor in the central coast of California). To comply with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the District needs to assess and monitor the effects of dredging on Essential Fish Habitat (EFH). Eelgrass/seagrass are relatively rare in coastal California embayments; however, the habitat provided is considered a significant component of EFH. The data collected from the pre-and post- dredge surveys will be analyzed to determine if there is a significant net loss of eelgrass resulting from the increased turbidity levels induced by the maintenance. A summary report will compare the results of previous eelgrass with the results of the pre-and post-dredge surveys. "Light monitoring" when dredging is adjacent to existing eelgrass/seagrass will also be performed.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all personnel, tools, materials, vehicles, supervision, and other items and services necessary provide to conduct the eelgrass surveys. A team composed of biologists (botanists and ecologists included), and mapping technicians with experience in eelgrass surveying is required. Eelgrass/seagrass shall be surveyed within the growing season and prior to the dredging episode and a post dredge survey would be conducted after the project, but outside the dormant season. Dredging each year typically occurs between June and November each year.</p>

<p>1. SCOPE</p>
<p>This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for the interview and predictive analysis of 150 nominees for the Pilot Training Next (PTN) program from 2 pools of candidates identified by the Government.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The interviews which the contractor will analyze will provide the PTN team with analytic data by which to select students for training. This data will also be used to validate the methodology of the PTN prototype. The validated predicted outcomes of the students in a traditional UPT environment will be compared against the outcomes of our selected student population, in order to develop an indicator for program rigor.</p>
<p>In seeking to select the highest quality of U.S. Air Force officer, in September 2001 U.S. Air Force Officer Accessions and Training Schools (AFOATS) issued a contract to conduct a research study and create a selection instrument that would enhance U.S. Air Force pilot recruitment and retention. By studying highly successful pilots and determining a set of characteristics and behaviors that differentiate them from more moderately successful pilots. An instrument was used that identified candidates with the kinds of talents characteristic of highly successful pilots. This instrument, the U.S. Air Force Pilot Interview, has been designed to identify pilot talent even in individuals who do not meet existing criteria for pilot selection (which emphasizes academic performance and skills&shy; based assessment and prediction) and despite candidates' lack of previous training or opportunities to express pilot talent. The U.S. Air Force Pilot Interview is intended to augment the U.S. Air Force's current pilot selection criteria as an inclusive selection instrument, in a manner that identifies potentially successful candidates who otherwise would not be identified through traditional selection criteria.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</p>
<p>The contractor shall use a scientific process that meets the psychometric standard embodied and required by the U.S. Department of Labor Uniform Guidelines and the American Psychological Association's Standards for Educational and Psychological tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>The contractor shall develop an assessment tool and data collection proccess to evaluate candidates.</li>
<li>The government will provide the contractor a detailed spreadsheet of pilot candidates and pertinent details.</li>

<li>The contractor shall consolidate and analyze results from the interviews and data collected using the assessment tool.</li>
<li>The contractor shall deliver individual pilot candidate selection reports, candidate rankings, recommendations, and executive report.</li>
<li>The contractor shall provide feedback sessions with selected pilot candidates and provide a debrief session with pilot instructors.</li>
</ul>

<p>The contractor shall provide an Executive Summary at HQ AFOATS once all the interviews are completed at which time project books will be provided. This summary is to occur not later than 30 days after the interviews have been completed.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		8105-00-NIB-1437<br />Name:		Envelopes, Packing List, 4-1/2" x 5-1/2"<br />Description:	Packing list envelopes are side loading and waterproof for document protection. Pressure-sensitive backing attaches securely to most surfaces. Envelopes are clear with the logo "Packing List Enclosed" in orange background with black letters. Measures 4-1/2" x 5-1/2", usable dimensions 4"x 5". UOI is PG. PG = 100</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			8105-00-NIB-1437<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	QUA 46894; MMM T1-100; BOX PL462; MMMT11000; QUA 46896; SPR41926</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no adverse impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please visit http://abilityone.gov/distributors/potential.html for more information.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>

<DESC><p>Special Notice (SN) DARPA-SN-18-05: Advanced Plant Technologies (APT) Proposers Day</p>
<p>DATE: December 12, 2017 LOCATION: Arlington, VA<br />REGISTRATION DEADLINE: December 6, 2017 or when capacity is reached, whichever comes first. We will continue to accept webinar only registrations through December 11, 2017 or until webinar capacity is reached, whichever comes first.<br />REGISTRATION WEBSITE: https://events.sa-meetings.com/APTProposersDay TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Blake Bextine, DARPA/BTO<br />Email: DARPA-SN-18-05@darpa.mil</p>
<p>The Biological Technologies Office (BTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a Proposers Day for the potential proposer community in support of a planned Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Advanced Plant Technologies (APT) program. The Proposers Day will be held on December 12, 2017 at The Westin Arlington Gateway hotel in Arlington, VA. Advance registration is required. The event will be webcast for those who would like to participate remotely. Advance registration is required for both the physical meeting and the webcast. Note, all times listed in this announcement and on the registration website are Eastern Time.</p>
<p>The Proposers Day objectives are:</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li>To introduce the science and technology community (industry, academia, and government) to the Advanced Plant Technologies program vision and goals;<br /><br />
<p>To explain the logistics of DARPA contract awards as well as the objectives of the Advanced Plant Technologies program;</p>
<p>To facilitate interaction between investigators that may have capabilities to develop elements of interest and relevance to Advanced Plant Technologies goals; and</p>
To encourage and promote teaming arrangements among organizations that have the necessary expertise, facilities and capabilities to meet research objectives established by the Advanced Plant Technologies program.
<p>The Proposers Day will include overview presentations by government personnel, an information session to respond to questions from participants, "lightning" talks (three minutes, one PowerPoint slide) and posters for potential proposers to highlight technical capability or interest to promote teaming.</p>
<p>Attendance at this event is not a requirement for submission of a proposal or selection for funding. Information relayed during the Proposers Day will be made available on the BTO section of the DARPA Opportunities page: http://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/opportunities.<br /><br />Advanced Plant Technologies Program Overview:</p>
<p>The goal of the APT program is to control and direct plant physiology to detect chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear threats, as well as electromagnetic signals. Plant sensors developed under the program will sense specific stimuli and report these signals with a remotely recognized phenotype (e.g., modified reflectance, morphology, phenology, etc.). Modern plant biotechnology holds significant promise for addressing a range of Department of Defense (DoD) needs; plants are easily deployed, self-powering, and ubiquitous in the environment, and the combination of these native abilities with specifically engineered sense-and-report traits will produce sensors occupying new and unique operational spaces. The long-term success of engineered plant sensors requires the ability to ensure plant survivability for months or years in a natural environment subject to stresses not present in a laboratory environment. Meeting both the sensor and survivability technical goals of the APT program will require a combination of plant genomics emerging technologies, precision gene editing tools, and novel methods for engineering new sensing capabilities and physiological responses. Proposing teams should include experts in diverse fields including plant physiology, gene editing, biochemistry, modelling, phenotyping, remote sensing, and plant ecology.</p>
<p>Proposers to APT are expected to advance plant synthetic biology for the purpose of bioengineering plant varieties for sensor use. DARPA strongly encourages teaming to ensure the expertise and capabilities necessary to meet program goals. Each established team is free to suggest their own potential stimulus-response pairs and applications. Proposing teams should include at least one team member with expertise in the proposed operational environment for the stimulus response capability.</p>
<p>Interested attendees are invited to present a brief one-slide PowerPoint summary of their interests and capabilities (see Attachment 1). These will be presented during 3-minute "lightning" presentations at Proposers Day. Presentations consisting of multiple slides will not be granted a time slot. Attendees may also choose to present a poster (see Attachment 2) describing their research interests that will be available for viewing and interaction for the duration of Proposers Day - those interested may submit both a lightning talk and a poster.<br /><br />Lightning talk and/or poster submissions will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis until time constraints (lightning talks) or physical capacity (posters) is reached. Lightning talk submissions are restricted to those attending the physical meeting. Interested parties are also invited to submit a one-page profile describing technical competencies and facility capabilities as it relates to the program and desired technical competencies in other potential teammates (Attachment 3).</p>
<p>All profiles, presentations, and posters must be emailed to DARPA-SN-18-05@darpa.mil no later than 12:00 PM EDT on December 7, 2017. Following the deadline, a consolidated list of all profiles (not presentations or posters) will be sent via email to the proposers who submitted a valid profile (following the format provided and not exceeding the single page limit).<br />Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants. Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the information<br /><br />and organizations contained in the consolidated teaming profile document, nor does DARPA or DoD exercise any responsibility for improper dissemination of the teaming profiles.</p>
<p>Registration Information:</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: Registration for physical participation will close on December 6, 2017 at 12:00 PM EST or when capacity is reached and webinar participation will close on December 11, 2017 at 12:00 PM EST or when webinar capacity is reached.</p>
<p>Registration is limited by the venue capacity, and early registration is strongly recommended.<br />There will be no on-site registration.</p>
<p>Participants must register in advance through the registration website. There will an optional $54 meal fee for the Proposers Day. Early registration is strongly recommended. Due to space limitations, attendance for the Proposers Day will be limited to the first 125 registrants. Remote participation via webcast is limited to 500 participants. Interested parties are encouraged to coordinate attendance internally within their organizations prior to registration. Physical attendance is limited to no more than two representatives per division/department. Individuals who are unable to register because the deadline has occurred or capacity has been reached, will be added to a waitlist. If slots remain open after registration closes or become available due to cancellations, the slots will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis from the waitlist.</p>
<p>An online registration form and various other meeting details can be found at the registration website, https://events.sa-meetings.com/APTProposersDay.</p>
<p>All attendees are required to present government-issued photo identification upon entry to the event.</p>
<p>Further administrative questions should be addressed to DARPA-SN-18-05@darpa.mil. Please refer to the Advanced Plant Technologies Proposers Day (DARPA-SN-18-05) in all correspondence. This announcement is not a request for proposals; any sent will be disregarded.</p>

<DESC>FBO ANNOUNCEMENT: PRESOLICITATION NOTICE, NOTICE OF INTENT
<p>ACTION CODE: SPECIAL NOTICE</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION CODE: 66 - Instruments and Laboratory Equipment</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Carl Zeiss AxioScan ZI, Automated Slide Scanner System</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB643020-18-00265</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: November 28, 2017</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Carl Zeiss, LLC located in Thornwood, NY for an Automated Slide Scanner System Software and Hardware.</p>
<p>Sole Source justification is based on the following:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Microscopy and Microanalysis Research Group (MMRG) conducts research on the development of innovative metrologies and measurement protocols for micro/nano-scale heterosystems analysis. Measurement techniques are used to determine sample composition as well as structural, electronic, and chemical properties of a wide variety of organic, inorganic, and biomolecular systems. To meet mission requirements in support of an inter-agency collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the MMRG needs to replicate an automated particle discovery and particle analysis system that was developed as a pre-prototype proof-of-concept scientific testbed by the DOE.</p>
<p>The goal of this effort is to purchase a commercial automated scanner to perform the automated microscopic scanning and image acquisition of the samples under analysis. Specifically, a Carl Zeiss AxioScan ZI will be used in NIST's duplication of the DOE-developed system. Because of the complexity of the overall control system, an exact duplicate of the slide used by NIST-DOE collaborators is needed to ensure proper operation of the entire particle analysis system. DOE has built and tested technology components of the analysis system. However, to ensure validity and quality of data, NIST needs to procure the exact hardware component to assemble a system for NIST use. These requirements are based directly on the capabilities and components known to function with the pre-existing DOE-developed automated particle system.</p>
<p>The system consists of the following:</p>
<p>AxioScan brightfield system with 5x, 10x, 20x, 40x cover slip corrected objectives and 10x, 20x, and 50x epi-plan Apochromat objectives; a one hundred slide holder magazine with twenty-five, four slide mounting frames for 26x76 mm slides with associated loading tools; a Hitachi HV-F202 camera set, tube module, and c-mount adapter; a Zeiss 55A R2 workstation, Firewire PCIe card, 8 ea. 32 GB of memory, 512 GB SSD, 2 ea. 10 GB PCIe Network adapter,  Windows 7, and 27" monitor;  ZEN 2.3 SlideScan Hardware License Key; ZEN Software Hitachi License; ZEN Image Analysis License Key; ZEN Advanced Processing Analysis License Key; ZEN Macro Enviroment License Key; ZEN 2.3 Desk License Key; A set of brightfield samples, and  calibration slides; and five days of advanced On-Site Training.</p>
<p><br />The system used at DOE is manufactured by Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC and contains hardware and proprietary software components. Since NIST and DOE will be sharing data through collaboration efforts, it is essential that the system purchased is entirely compatible with the DOE system software interface to ensure successful replication of the particle discovery and analysis system based on DOE design. Market research has shown that Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC is the sole company that can provide this equipment and compatible proprietary software to NIST.</p>
<p>Given these facts, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC is the only source reasonably available to provide the required equipment and proprietary software.</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 11:00 am EST 11/28/2017, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

PROVISION FAR 52.212-1 -- INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS, applies to this acquisition.  

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS 

(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made using a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) approach; the Government will award to the lowest priced offeror that is determined technically acceptable.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

(i)	Factor 1: Technical Capability 

(1.)	 The offeror shall submit their technical approach and demonstrated experience/evidence of ability to successfully perform the services.  Submit information on qualified key personnel, such as resume for the Principal Investigator and Archaeology Field Crew Supervisor.   Both Investigator and Supervisor shall have at a minimum a MA degree in Archaeology, at least one year of professional experience in Archaeological research, administration and/or management; at least one year of supervised field and analytic experience in North American Archaeology; in addition, at least one year of field experience in the Plains region.  The factor will be rated as "Technically Acceptable" or "Technically Unacceptable."
(2.)	"Technically Acceptable" is defined as the item offered to the Government that meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. 
(3.)	"Technically Unacceptable" is defined as the item offered to the Government that does not meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.


(ii)	Factor 2:  Past Performance

1.	Past performance shall provide adequate information describing the offeror's previous experience in providing Archaeological survey and report services within the past three years from the issuance date of this RFQ. The offeror shall also list all contracts performed in the past three years from issue date of this RFQ that are of the same magnitude and complexity of this project. In addition, the Government may solicit past performance on contracts not listed by the offeror. If an offeror does not have any past performance information to submit as the entity under which the offer is being submitted, then the offeror should submit past performance data identified above under which the offeror's key personnel have worked.  The offeror's quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which its past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance.  The evaluation will consider both the relevance and quality of past projects.  The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).   The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination. An Offeror without relevant past performance will receive a neutral rating (i.e., neither technically acceptable nor technically unacceptable).  


Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal to cost or price.  

(b)	 Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c)	Award Process: 

1.	The Government will first evaluate all quotations to ensure the quotation complies with all material aspects of the request for quotation thereby being determined as either "Responsive" or "Non-Responsive." 

2.	 Responsive quotes will then be submitted for Technical Evaluation to determine those that are either "Technically Acceptable" or "Technically Unacceptable."

3.	"Technically Acceptable" quotations will be then ranked according to Price.

4.	The lowest priced offeror who is technically acceptable will receive the award.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

FAR 52.212-3 - OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS 
The offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov . If the Offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, the Offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (r) of this provision.

<DESC>SERVICE REQUIREMENT (Fiscal Year 2018) <br />PR: 0071300660<br />Material Code: R499- V00007588<br />Solicitation: SP4702-18-Q-0500<br />NAICS: 541613, Size Standard $15,000,000.00<br />Description: Analysis of Defense Logistics Agency's (DLA) telework program's impact on performance &amp; culture<br />Firm Fixed Price Acquisition <br />Total Small-Business Set-Aside<br /><br />Period of Performance:Estimated at four months from time of award January 2018 - May 2018 est.&nbsp;
<p>Aqusition Authority: FAR Part 12 "Acquisition of Commercial Items" and FAR 13 "Simplified Acquisition Procedure"</p>
<p>Service Description:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The primary objective is to propose methodology and conduct a research-based study to analyze DLA's telework program and determine its relationship to or impact on, if any, DLA's organizational culture and performance. This study will assess senior leadership's and supervisory perceptions of telework at DLA, by leadership level and organization, to determine if, and to what extent, telework impacts organizational culture and performance. This study will evaluate if there is any correlation between the frequency of telework and/or the number of teleworking employees, and if so, what the impact of that correlation might be on key performance indicators (as measured by the agency) or culture of the organization based on reports provided from the agency-wide culture/climate survey(s). The "study" will benchmark DLA's telework program by comparing DLA telework data to other DoD organizations using DoD's annual report to other Federal entities and the annual Office of Personnel Management (OPM) telework report to Congress. The study also will identify current industry trends and best practices regarding telework in the private sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additional details can be found in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) within solicitation SP470218Q0500.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Acquistion Notes:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Should the vendor have any questions with respect to this RFQ, they should submit them, via e-mail, to the Acquisition Specialist (Erik.Minshall@dla.mil). Any technical questions, requests for clarification or requests for data in connection with this RFQ must be submitted in writing on or before - November 27, 2017 NLT 3:00 p.m. to allow the government adequate time to provide correct answers to the questions submitted and to prevent any delays in the closing date of the RFQ. Vendors are strongly urged to follow-up the submission of any questions with a phone call to the Contracting Specialist to ensure that questions have been received.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Email Quote: DLA Internet Bid Board Systems, (DIBBS) quotations are not acceptable for this solicitation. Offerors must complete the entire solicitation no later than the closing date. Quotes will be submitted on hard copy of this Request for Quote, (RFQ), to the attention of Mr. Erik Minshall, scanned and emailed to Erik.Minshall@dla.mil. Please ensure that all clauses are completed and returned. Proposals must be validated for at least ninety (90) days from the date of submission. Also, SAM (System for Award Management) certification must be checked and valid for over six (6) months from the proposal date of submission. SAM's certification copy must be submitted with your proposal. SAM's certification and proposal submission date must match. Certification is available at https://www.sam.gov. Note: Proposals (to include modifications and revisions per FAR 15.203(c)) will be received by electronic commerce methods (e-mail). The acquisition specialist shall authorize receipt of e-mailed proposals only on those solicitations where there is a reasonable expectation the proposal will not exceed the maximum size limit of 15 MB, therefore it is inappropriate to authorize e-mailed proposals for very large and/or complex solicitations. If the size and/or complexity of the initial proposal submission makes it impractical for the initial proposal to be e-mailed, the acquisition specialist may authorize use of email only for modifications and revisions to proposals.</p>
<p>Proposal shall be submitted by email. Contractors proposal must be submitted in the following manner:<br />A. SF1449.<br />B. SAM's certification.<br />C. Section B -Pricing.<br />D.

Resumes and references of personnel identified to support the work activities identified in the PWS.<br />F. Submission of at least three and no more than five references for relevant contracts in the past five (5) years for similar work (in size and scope) provided to either Government agencies or private industries. Each project must include the name, address, and point of contact, telephone number, dollar value, period of performance, and brief description of work. A summary description of the task requirements of each referenced contract. Reference the similarities and differences of these tasks to those requirements as referenced in the PWS and total dollar value of each contract reference.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

E.2	NOTICE OF FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR AGENCY PROTESTS
A.	Preface
Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties must use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party. FEMA offers, as an option for dispute resolution, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).  ADR in an informal, expeditious and inexpensive way to resolve contract issues and is designed to promote satisfying solutions and fair procedures. For more information on FEMA's ADR services, please contact FEMA's ADR office at the following address: 500 C Street SW, Washington, DC 20472.  If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency.  These procedures have been designed to create an avenue for resolving third party grievances in connection with the acquisition process outside of formal processes through the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC). Filing an agency protest is not a prerequisite to filing at the GAO or CFC. If the protester files a protest through the GAO or CFC while their protest is pending at the agency level, FEMA may dismiss the agency protest.  Pursuing an agency protest does not extend the time for obtaining a stay at GAO. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in FAR Subpart 33.103.<BR><BR>B.	Definitions.
(1)	"Agency protest," as used in this SOP, is one that may be filed with either the Contracting Officer or the officer responsible for the resolution of all agency protests filed at the level above the Contracting Officer.
(2)	"Ombudsman," as used in this SOP, is the agency official above the level of the Contracting Officer designated by the Director of the Acquisition Management Division to handle and issue the formal agency decision resolving the protest.	Protesters using these procedures may protest directly to the Ombudsman.
(3)	"Day," as used in this SOP, is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday.  Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of FEMA are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Agency is open.

C.	Submission Guidelines.
(1)	Agency protests may be filed through the Contracting Officer or, at the level above the Contracting Officer, through the Ombudsman either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested) as follows:
a.	Protests filed through the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman must be mailed to FEMA DR-4332-TX
Attn: Mr. Sherwin C. Turner
Contracting Officer 
11000 N. Interstate 35
Austin, TX 78753

-OR-

OCPO
Attn: David Orris Building D, Room 123
16825 South Seton Avenue Emmitsburg, MD 21727
b.	The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency Protest".
c.	If the protester submits the protest directly through the Ombudsman, the protester must also, within one (1) day of submitting the protest to the Ombudsman, submit a copy of the protest to the responsible Contracting Officer either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested).
(2)	) To be filed on a given day, protests and any subsequent appeals must be received by 4:30 PM, current-local time. Any protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day.
(3)	Protest submissions will not be considered filed until all of the following information is provided:
a.	the protester's name, address, telephone number and fax number;
b.	the solicitation or contract number;
c.	a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, to include an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced;
d.	copies of relevant documents;
e.	a request for ruling by the agency;
f.	a statement detailing the form of relief requested;
g.	all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purposes of filing a protest; and
h.	all information establishing the timeliness of the protest.
(4)	All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester, and must be addressed to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman.<BR><BR>D.	Timeliness/Resolution of Protests.
(1)	Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties which do not exist in the initial solicitation but which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals following the incorporation.
(2)	Protests other than those covered by paragraph (1) of this section shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of protest is known or should have been known (whichever is earlier), with the exception of protests challenging a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required. In such cases, with respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the initial protest shall not be filed before the debriefing date offered to the protester, but shall be filed not later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held.
(3)	Protests filed through the Contracting Officer.
a.	Within twenty (20) days after the protest is filed through the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Return Receipt Requested)".
b.	Appeals
i.	Protesters who filed protests through the Contracting Officer may, within five (5) days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's written ruling, appeal to the Ombudsman.
ii.	Requests for Appellate Review must be submitted to the Ombudsman by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested).
iii.	The Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within ten (10) days of receipt of the request for appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision.
iv.	In accordance with FAR 33.103(d) (4) and 4 C.F.R 21.2(a) (3), if there is an agency appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision on the protest, it will not extend GAO'S timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within ten (10) days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action.
(4)	Protests filed through the Ombudsman:
a.	If the protester protests directly through the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within thirty-five (35) days after the protest was filed.
b.	Protests filed directly through the Ombudsman cannot be appealed within the agency.<BR><BR>E.	Dismissal of Protests.
The agency may dismiss protests when protesters file protests through the GAO or CFC while their protests are pending at the agency level; and for failure to comply with any of the requirements of these agency protest procedures. For example, the agency may dismiss protests that are procedurally or substantively defective (e.g., the protest is untimely or the protest fails).<BR><BR>

<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD<br />The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Contractor whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is the lowest price, technically acceptable quotation.</p>
<p>Technically acceptable means that the Contractor provides a system that meets the requirements specified in the Statement of Work, and the requirements of all Line Items. If a Contractor does not indicate how its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.</p>
<p>Price will be evaluated to determine that total price is consistent with the technical portion of the quotation and is a fair and reasonable overall price to the Government.</p>
<p>NIST intends to evaluate quotes and issue a contract based on the initial quotes received.  Therefore, the Contractor's initial quote should contain the Contractor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. NIST reserves the right to request revised quotes from, or negotiate final contract terms with, one or more, but not all, Contractors if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS<br />All Contractors shall submit the following:<br />1.	For the purpose of evaluation of Technical Acceptability: Documentation that confirms the contractor is capable of providing the equipment specified in the statement of work. Contractors shall include a copy of the quoted system's manufacturer's specifications.  <br /> <br />2.	Contractors shall provide pricing for the following line items. All equipment must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.<br />Line Item 0001: Quantity one (1) microplate dispenser meeting all specifications in accordance with the Statement of Work, inclusive of F.O.B Destination shipping, a two-year warranty, and a manual.</p>
<p>3.	A completed version of all required solicitation provisions (see attached provisions/clauses document - required submissions highlighted in blue).</p>
<p>4.	If the contractor objects to any of the terms and conditions contained in this solicitation, the contractor shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:" [Contractor shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)].  It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to identify in their quote any exceptions to the terms and conditions of the solicitation.

<p>6.	If the Contractor's representations and certifications in SAM.gov do not reflect the NAICS code governing this solicitation, Contractors must submit documentation that they are a small business under the NAICS code governing this solicitation.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Turf 
Turf mowing   Initial 20 acres of VA at entrance (38 times per year). 
Bare areas   Initial 20 acres of VA at entrance, areas without growth- scarify/ disk/water/fertilize/core aeration/dethatch, top dress with soil and sand if areas need it.
Compacted Soil   Initial 20 acres of VA at entrance, compaction issues treated by core aeration twice a year, open soil up to increase root growth, air flow, and water movement which strengthens the lawn and thus decreases weeds as they are choked out, many of the new areas planted on top of compacted soil or as in the case of the front drive in weather and time has eroded the topsoil down to the compacted hard sandy clay layer
Weeds - rid turf of weeds by applying weed killer twice a year, weed and feed with pre- and post-emergent.
Nutrition - fertilize twice per year to improve turf color/vigor/health, soil samples sent for analysis and review Dec. 2016   add Lime to areas with low pH.
Water - schedule irrigation for less frequent and greater amount of water (1/2-1 ) per watering to increase depth of root systems.

Beds (approx.125)
Pre-emergent - prevents existing weed seeds from germinating, application two times per year (Spring and Mid-Summer).

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OTI's Niger program seeks to further U.S. foreign policy objectives in Niger through support that targets drivers of instability in Niger and the region. Drivers may include, but are not limited to, political and economic exclusion, particularly among youth and marginalized groups, reintegration of returned workers and ex-combatants, the presence of extremist organizations, lack of state presence and/or good governance coupled with a lack of opportunities for political participation. OTI intends to address these critical issues through a flexible, small-grants mechanism that tailors approaches to the varied needs of communities in Niger. The program may utilize both "soft" (e.g. cultural and recreational activities, media and strategic communications) and "hard" (e.g. small-scale infrastructure) activities to strengthen linkages between communities, local actors, and the Nigerien government and to increase community cohesion. The program may also support national level activities, such as elections in 2016 or other emerging transition needs.</p>
<p>The Country Representative - Niger is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, and reports to the Washington-based OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee. The Country Representative's principle responsibility will be the development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Niger program. The Country Representative will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>The Country Representative post is a senior-level position requiring supervisory management experience, the ability to serve as an effective liaison with a wide array of individuals and institutions, and an in-depth knowledge of international relations in general.  Knowledge of the sub-region is also desirable. Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights. Excellent interpersonal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary. Experience in contract and grant management is required. Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies and/or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically-charged and challenging security environments. It is also essential that the incumbent demonstrate the ability to maintain staff morale in a difficult work environment. Strong team-building skills are essential.</p>

<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation.</p>

<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate.</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g. Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<DESC><br /><strong>IN FBO IT SHOWS AMENDMENT 9, 10, &amp; 11 THEY ARE ALL AMENDMENT A008 <br /><br /><br /><br />*****THIS IS AN SBA C0MPETITIVE 8(a) Set-aside*******</strong><br /><br /><br />The purpose of this solicitation is to provide financial support and administrative services to the Department of State (DoS), Bureau of the Comptroller and Global Financial Services (CGFS) Global Financial Services organization in Charleston, South Carolina (CGFS Charleston). CGFS provides financial services to the Department of State, including domestic organizations and overseas posts. CGFS Charleston has grown dramatically over the past ten years in response to changes in the way in which financial services are provided. CGFS began as a consolidation platform for overseas financial activities supported by heterogeneous applications and has grown into a single organization providing world-wide financial services supported by modern systems that provide increasing functionality through the internet and the DoS Intranet.
<p><br />Led by the Department's Comptroller, the Bureau's strategic focus is largely derived from the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, President's Management Agenda, and Department's Strategic Plan. CGFS currently provides financial and administrative services in support of overseas and domestic operations primarily in Charleston, SC, but also has operations in: Washington, DC; Paris, France; Bangkok, Thailand; Manila, Philippines; Athens, Greece; and, Sofia, Bulgaria. We operate a global 24/7 financial platform with financial services and support operations that are ISO-9001:2008 certified. These services include Disbursing, Accounting, Payroll, Payments, Accounts Receivable, Treasury Reporting and operations in support of these activities, including services related to the operation and maintenance of local area networks, maintenance of installed systems supporting automated financial systems and systems analyses, user support and training related to installed automated financial and payroll systems.</p>
<p>While this Statement of Work provides a best projection of current and near-term requirements, the specific evolutionary paths of how financial services will be provided in the future cannot be precisely predicted. The labor categories and descriptions are likewise based on the best projections of current and near-term needs. Even so, the scope of this requirement will continue to focus on the three foundational functions: performing the Department's basic financial accounting (domestic and overseas); disbursing (paying Department's bills, both commercial invoices and reimbursements to individuals); and, performing the Department's payroll function for Foreign Service Officers (active and retired), Civil Service personnel and Locally Employed Staff supporting the Department's overseas posts. In addition to these three basic functions, CGFS Charleston operates the supporting data systems and infrastructure that support these primary functions.</p>
<p>C.2 BACKGROUND<br />The above activities currently employs a mixture of government employees and contract personnel; most of whom support operations in Charleston with approximately 40 employees positioned in Bangkok, Thailand, and Rosslyn, Virginia. The amount of future growth in these areas is unknown at this time. However, in order to anticipate the potential usage by other CGFS organizations, the Washington DC metropolitan area and Bangkok, Thailand will be secondary places of performance, with approximately 5% of the total contract designated for Washington and Thailand area usage. A need will exist to provide temporary services in the Washington area in support of the CGFS Charleston Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP Plan). These services would be provided by designated personnel traveling to the COOP sites, currently located in State Department Annex 15, Rosslyn, Virginia, and at the DoS Beltsville Information Management Center, State Department Annex 26, Beltsville, Maryland during times of COOP training and/or activation if CGFS Charleston is closes because of a local emergency.<br /><br />C.2.1 The CGFS Bureau serves as the Department's comptroller and provider of all financial services. Included in the CGFS Charleston mission is the operation of automated systems that support these activities as well as administrative functions that provide support to CGFS Charleston. CGFS Charleston along with offices in Bangkok and Paris conducts the financial operations for the Department and includes the following organizations:<br />Global Systems Operations: Hosts and operates the Department's corporate financial applications, including the Joint Financial Management System (USAID's Momentum core-accounting system).<br />Global Financial Operations: Global accounting for bureaus, posts, and customer agencies; corporate receivable operations and travel card management, domestic vendor and employee payments, and Treasury reporting.<br />Global Compensation: Payroll operations for American Civil and Foreign Service employees, Department and other agency Locally Employed (LE) Staff worldwide, and Foreign Service retirees.<br />Overseas Disbursing: Delegated disbursing authority for overseas payments in US Dollars and 137 foreign currencies through 214 bank accounts in 174 countries, including cashier management for 354 cashiers worldwide.<br />Management Controls and Oversight Analysis: Department-wide administration of FMFIA, FFMIA, OMB Circular A-123 Appendices A (financial reporting) and C (improper payments) program, external and financial audit coordination support, internal audit and program review operations.<br />Customer Support and Financial Training: Functional and technical financial management training, tailored to meet the needs of Foreign National financial management staff (over 3,100 students per year) and global help desk activities.<br />Post Support Unit: centralized financial transaction processing support for all overseas posts supporting regionalization and innovation in the delivery of remote financial services. <br />Executive Office: Administrative, management, planning and resource allocation activities and operations, including budget, human resources, internal and external ISSO support for systems, and general service operations.<br />C.2.1.1 CGFS Quality Management System. CGFS is an ISO 9001 certified activity with a commitment to customer service and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>C.3 SCOPE OF WORK <br /><br />Section J Attachments A thru D outline the initial transition task and three sample tasks. A sample of each is further detailed in section C. 4, below. CGFS is an ISO 9001:2008 certified activity and each task will identify the Quality Management System (QMS) documentation that is required to successfully perform the task activities. The QMS documentation includes Quality Work Instructions (QWI), external and internal reference documents, forms and Standard Operating Procedures. All tasks will be performed in government facilities using government furnished equipment. Contractor personnel will be integrated with government personnel who will provide such detailed guidance as may be needed concerning specific tasks, schedules and priorities to ensure the overall successful execution of the CGFS Charleston mission.<br /><br />C.3.1 Transition Task Section J Attachment A. This task will provide for an orderly transition of services from the current contractor to the new contractor. This task will provide the incoming contractor with an opportunity to better understand the details of CGFS Charleston operations and processes; hire, orient and train new personnel; and develop the schedule for assuming responsibility for performance of services from the outgoing contractor.</p>
<p>C.3.2 Sample Financial Services Performance Task, Section J, Attachment B. This task constitutes the preponderance of services and supports the accounting, disbursing, bill paying, payroll, cash management, training and related services.<br /><br />C.3.3 Sample Executive Office Task Performance Task, Section J, Attachment C. This task provides for those administrative services that the contractor will perform in support of the CGFS organization.<br /><br />C.3.4 Sample Information Technology Performance Task, Section J, Attachment D. This task describes the automated data systems support the contractor will provide, including operations and maintenance of hardware and software systems that support CGFS Charleston's financial services.<br /><br />C.3.5 The contractor shall provide all necessary personnel per the attached spreadsheet of negotiated labor categories at the full-time work locations in Charleston, Washington, DC metro-area and overseas locations.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting<br />`more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-</p>
<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>
<p>(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-</p>
<p>(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.</p>
<p>(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:</p>
<p>(i) warrants;</p>
<p>(ii) options;</p>
<p>(iii) contracts to acquire stock;</p>
<p>(iv) convertible debt instruments; and</p>
<p>(v) others similar interests.</p>
<p>(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.</p>
<p>(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:</p>
<p>it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.108-7001 through 3009.108-7003;</p>

All reports of reading and inspections required by the specifications shall be submitted to the COR in writing using a "Condition Found Report (CFR)" form, within 24 hours after the readings and/or inspections are made. <br />Promptness in taking and reporting readings is particularly important for underbody work items such as shaft bearing or rudder bearing clearances. Often during the progress of a work item, conditions are discovered by the contractor which are considered abnormal for reasons of safety, expected reliability, health, or habitability. These conditions must be brought to the attention of the Coast Guard using a CFR. Details provided by the Contractor in a CFR are important because the CFR may result in a contract change. To speed the contract change progress, the Contractor should include in his/her CFR the following details as a minimum:</p>
<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>
<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>
<p>(b) Change Request Process will occur in the following order:</p>
<p>1. Condition Found Report-Generated by the contractor and provided to COR . <br />2. Condition Report Reply-Generated by the COR and provided to Contractor<br />3.

Negotiations- If needed, take place to establish pricing<br />7. Approved Change Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COR by the KO</p>
<p>Change Request must be submitted by the COR to the contractor within 24 hours after responding to the CFR. Contractor must submit proposal to the Contracting Officer within 72 hours receipt of the Change Request.</p>
<p>A modification will be issued to incorporate and implement all changes made by change orders.</p>
<p><br />9. CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COR.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 issues to remove request for business declaration.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capability from sources that can provide Professional Information Technology Services for The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Enterprise Service Center (ESC).  Additionally, this market survey is being conducted to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists, to identify capability among small businesses, SEDB/8a sources, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses; and to identify those Small businesses that offer the services via federal schedules.

The FAA intends to establish a Multiple Award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for short-term special project needs for The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Enterprise Service Center (ESC).  The project needs will be in support of a variety of potential requirements to ESCâ€™s Procurement (PRISM) and Financial (DELPHI) Systems. 
   
1.0	Background
The Enterprise Services Center (ESC) is an organization located at MMAC. ESC operates as a Federal Financial Shared Service Provider and is one of four federal financial management Centers of Excellence as designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide integrated business services and solutions to the Federal Government.  ESC resides under FAAâ€™s Regions and Center Operations Line of Business (ARC) and operates under a â€œfee-for-serviceâ€ principle, which encourages business-like decisions creating more cost awareness and increased customer focus.  Its primary purpose is to provide core accounting and application support services for federal government agencies. This service involves the use of multiple Information Technology applications, hosted and managed on behalf of its financial services customers.

2.0	Identified Requirements
As a reference, at a high level, ESCâ€™s IT services needs may encompass, but not limited to:  
â€¢	Enterprise Architecture (EA)
â€¢	Quality Assurance (QA) Functional Testing
â€¢	Technical Writing
â€¢	Project Management
â€¢	Database Administration
â€¢	System/Application Development
â€¢	System/Application Administration
â€¢	Middle Tier Administration
â€¢	Configuration Management
â€¢	Information System Security 
Potential Projects:
â€¢	Automated Software Testing  
â€¢	Implementation of Government Risk Compliance
â€¢	Upgrade Serena (Configuration Management)
â€¢	Oracle Application Development / Support
â€¢	Treasury Mandates (Security) 
â€¢	Upgrade of Compusearch
â€¢	Internet Download Manager (IDM)
â€¢	iSupplier

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  However, the Government anticipates pricing of projects on a Firm Fixed Price and/-or Time and Material basis. When a Request for Proposal is issued the FAA may decide to issue the Screening Information Request for full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities to meet requirements in the attached description.  The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy.

Responses will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendorsâ€™ expense.

3.0	Instructions

<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers plans to award a contract to provide laboratory testing services to the Washington Aqueduct according to federal and regional EPA and the Commonwealth of Virginia requirements for various chemical, biological, radiological, and other parameters for the purposes of complying with all Federal drinking water regulations and as required for special water and wastewater projects.</p>
<p>The WA Laboratory is certified by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region III to perform drinking water testing for regulatory compliance under the EPA Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA Region III considers the WA Laboratory to be a Principal State Laboratory (PSL) within Region III. As a PSL, the WA Laboratory is required by EPA to ensure all primacy critical analyses contracted to commercial laboratories are either certified under the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP) or be State Laboratories which are either NELAP certified or certified directly by EPA Region III. In addition, the commercial laboratory shall have federal EPA-approval for performing compliance testing under the EPA Unregulated Monitoring Rule (UCMR) and Long Term 2 (LT2) Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. Because the WA Laboratory performs drinking water testing for Virginia customers, the commercial laboratory shall also maintain certification by the Commonwealth of Virginia drinking water program or Virginia Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (VELAP).</p>
<p>The commercial laboratory shall have a primary focus on supporting the drinking water community in the area of compliance testing using certified methods, as well as, the areas of pilot-project and research testing of both common and emerging contaminants using both established methods with appropriate modifications and recently-developed methods. The commercial laboratory shall have the capacity and capabilities to meet the needs for quick turnaround reporting of quality testing performed on high volumes of samples. It is also imperative that the laboratory not perform analyses on soil and waste matrices which are incompatible with the potable water matrix. The laboratory is required to maintain state-of-science current technology on all analytical equipment, sample collection, sample preparation, information management, and communications necessary to perform the services under this contract and should be able to adapt to all future analytical needs and requirements of the water supply industry.</p>
<p>The commercial laboratory shall meet all of the requirements described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and shall be certified (where applicable) and capable of testing for all of the parameters at or near the Minimum Reporting Limits (MRLs) using the prescribed methods (or equivalent).</p>

<a href="mailto:felicia.demita@va.gov and Amanda.Simmons2@va.gov">felicia.demita@va.gov</a>
<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice.  Network Contracting Office (NCO 21) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to result in a single-award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) for temporary medical staffing for each health care system   one for VA San Francisco Medical Center (SFVAMC) and one for VA Northern California Health Care System (VANCHCS).   
Statement of Need:
The purpose of this acquisition is to provide contracting support for temporary medical staffing needs for both SFVAMC and VANCHCS.  Both medical centers require contractor support to supplement their staffing with respect to Critical Care Registered Nurses (RN), Med/Surgery Registered Nurses (RN), Chronic Hemodialysis Nurses (RN), Radiology Nurses (RN), Post Anesthesia Care Unit Nurses, Operating Room Nurses, Emergency Room (RN), Chemotherapy Nurses, Licensed Practical/Vocational Nurses (LPN/LVN), Nursing Assistants (NA), Nurse Practitioners (NP), Monitor Technicians, Instrument Technicians, Surgical Technicians, SPS Technicians, and Medical Support Assistants to augment in-house staffing.  
This is a per diem staffing requirement.  In other words, the requirement is on a random, as-needed basis.  Before utilizing contractor support for VA staffing the VA will use its own VA intermittent employees.  Consequently, most of the contractor support is not scheduled in advance and is required within up to 24 hours of notice.  As a result, it requires an extensive pool of candidates from each of the required labor categories to meet the needs on a random, unscheduled basis.  Moreover, all candidates must successfully pass a background check and be approved through the VA s credentialing process that can take anywhere from several weeks to a few months.  
Interested offerors will be required to submit at least 50 or more candidates for each health care system with the proposal submission to include the employee s name, their place of residence, their start date with the offeror, a copy of their license, and an indication as to which facility(ies) they are available to work.     
Additionally, since both health care systems are Joint Commission Accredited, the interested offerors should identify if they are certified with Joint Commission as a temporary medical staffing firm and provide a copy of the certification.
Solicitation:
The anticipated release date will be in December 2017 with proposals due in early January 2018.  The NAICS is 561320 Temporary Help Services with the size standard of $27.5M.  The Product Service Code is Q401 Medical   Nursing.  Interested offerors should continuously check FBO (www.fbo.gov) for the solicitation.  This requirement will be set-aside as a total small business set-aside.  Limitations on Subcontracting will apply.
All questions must be submitted by email to felicia.demita@va.gov .  No telephone questions will be accepted.

The preponderance of work performed will be at this location with occasional travel requirements to support field sites in both CONUS and International locations. Current weapon systems supported by this effort will include the U-2 aircraft, the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), Special Projects, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and associated support systems. We are establishing an enterprise approach for accomplishing effective Supply Chain Management (SCM) to provide global logistics support to the war fighter. The ECLS performance tasks include functioning as the Service Provider (SP) at the enterprise level for Materiel Management, Warehousing and related SCM activities as identified by the C2ISR weapon systems. Additionally, technical support of sustainment activities associated with product support of weapon system inventory of the kind provided by a technical/sustainment analyst will be required. An essential component of the ECLS effort is to use the web based Automated Logistics Management Support System (ALMSS) and/or other DoD approved supply support systems (e.g., D200 [Requirements Management System], D035 [Stock Control and Distribution System], D043 [Master Item Identification Control System]). These logistics support systems will be used to track material usage, provide historical data, determine stocking levels, and provide stock control and distribution functionality for both national stock number and part number peculiar items for wholesale and retail distribution.</span>

 Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
 (X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Steris Corporation is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the Sterilizers holds the proprietary rights to all equipment parts and hardware. A third-party vendor exists, but are not capable of performing maintenance and repair of the equipment. Many of the third parties would subcontract the maintenance and repair portion of the contract to Steris or another large business and charge a 13% to 25% premium for program management (i.e. contract administration). Furthermore, third party vendors must be able to access parts within twenty-four (24) hours to ensure there is no delay in sterilizing the equipment. Any delay would impact patient care, by cancelling appointments and surgeries due not having sterilized equipment. Equipment must be sterilizers to comply with federal and state laws. If the Sterilizer is inoperable or breaks, it would cost an expensive amount of monies for a replacement, take up to twelve (12) months to install and more time to train staff. Furthermore, improper maintenance or repair by another vendor may lead to voiding any warranties, delay of patient treatment and an increase of patients trying to obtain appointments at clinics.

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed:  A sources sought notice (VA262-17-N-2002) was placed on www.fbo.gov (issued from September 13,2017 through September 25, 2017) requesting interested Service Disabled Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), Small Businesses and Women Owned Small Businesses (WOSB) and three (3) SDVOSB responded; Sustainment Technologies, VanDahl Engineering & Sales Ltd., and Janz Corporation. These three companies are verified on VetBiz, and stated that they can provide the service (although VanDahl Engineering &Sales declined to participate in the solicitation process). However, two of the companies will be subcontracting the maintenance and repair portion of the contract out. All three companies were notified that they must comply with the Limitations of Subcontracting Act and provide 51% of the service. They all stated that they will be providing the program monitoring (i.e. contract administration). However, contract monitoring (billing, and invoicing) does not equal 51% of the contract. The bulk of the contract is maintenance and repair of the sterilizers.  Sterilizers are important to VISN 22 Healthcare System as they are utilized for sterilizing medical equipment for clinics and surgeries. It is not reasonable for taxpayers or the Department of Veterans affairs to pay a company a thirteen (13%) premium for contract administration of the service especially if the companies are going to subcontract the work to the OEM. Additionally, 


VISN 22 requirement is for maintenance and repair of equipment, not program management (i.e. contract administration). This equipment must remain in optimum working condition to avoid delay in patient treatment.  Any delay would cause cancellation of surgeries and clinic appointments.  Contractors must be able to obtain the OEM parts with twenty-four (24) hours to ensure there is no delay in the event of equipment failure. This requirement is needed to ensure the equipment is sterilized for patient healthcare.

Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated total dollar amount of this procurement is $611,052.40 for a base plus three (3) option years. The Contracting Officer relied on the healthcare facilities Independent Government Estimate (IGE) and the informal quotes provided from the sources sought to determine fair and reasonable pricing. The IGE was significantly lower than the informal quotes, therefore the pricing from the OEM has been determined fair and reasonable to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  As described in Section VI above, in accordance with FAR Part 10, market research was conducted through GSA, SBA, Vet Biz, by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties. It was determined that contractors are not capable of providing the service besides the contract administration portion for the requirement.

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  As this is a Steris proprietary system, no other sources are capable of meeting this need.

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section 6 above.

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  None. Overcoming barriers of competition is not feasible at this time, as no other vendors are able parts or servicing. The contracting officer will annually research additional systems other than the Steris Sterilizers and ensure that this is the best procurement method.  In the future, the requesting service shall research similar systems from other companies who will have the ability to access licensing, software updates and parts; therefore, competition cannot be realized at this time.

Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
