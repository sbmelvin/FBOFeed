<CONTACT>Anthony Cicala, Contracting Officer, Phone (571)218-4639, Fax (XXX)XXX-XXX, Email acicala@darpa.mil
<DESC>With this Presolicitation Notice, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO), through the Contracts Management Office (CMO), announces its intent to issue a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) No. HR0011-04-R-0001, on or about 21 JUN 04, for the Optically Designated Attack Munitions (ODAM) Program.  All qualified and capable sources, consistent with the terms and conditions of the RFP, are encouraged to respond.  Offerors, however, are notified that nothing promulgated herein obligates the Government to take any further action associated with this announcement.

The purpose of this Presolicitation Notice is as follows:
1) Put offerors on notice of DARPA's intent to issue a formal RFP for the subject program on or about 21 JUN 04;
2)* Seek offeror feedback on the attached DRAFT RFP No. HR0011-04-R-0001, prior to release of the FINAL RFP; and
3)** Alert offerors of DARPA's intent to hold a Proposers Day Conference associated with the subject RFP for those qualified to attend, on or about 21 JUN 04.

*NOTE:  With respect to the Government's request for feedback from interested parties on the attached DRAFT RFP documents, respondents are herein notified that the Government reserves the right to incorporate, not incorporate, or incorporate with modifications, any such comments received.  Any comments on the attached DRAFT RFP documents MUST be sent to the following two email addresses:  acicala@darpa.mil and ODAM-RFP@darpa.mil for consideration.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to not consider any comments received after 4:00pm Arlington, Virginia LOCAL TIME on 14 JUN 04.

**NOTE:  Details of the Proposers Day Conference are anticipated to be discussed under a separate FedBizOpps announcement, and offerors are advised to be watchful for this information.  Interested offerors are not required to attend any such Proposers Day Conference in order to respond to any upcoming RFP.

The ODAM Program is a technology development and integration effort to demonstrate a low cost optical seeker for converting a 60mm mortar into a precision guided munitions system.  It is anticipated that these systems will improve U.S. effectiveness in providing small unit of operations with cost effective organic precision indirect fires capable of operating across the full gamut of environments including grassland, desert, arctic, and urban.  DARPA believes that the desired performance and cost characteristics can be achieved by the combination of innovative design and integration of existing and developmental technologies, resulting in a guidance package fuze system that is "plug compatible" with existing munitions.  Examples of technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  LED alternatives to laser designators, uncooled photodetector technology (daytime and nighttime alternatives), design alternatives for compact optics, etc.  Only those designs meeting minimum standards, as set forth in the RFP, will be considered.  These minimums include, but are not limited to, the following:  4-meter CEP static; daytime and nighttime operation; contact fuze, 100-meter steering range; production cost (lot size 30,000 units) less than $500; and a program schedule not-to-exceed 30 months.  The ultimate goal of the program is deployment of the guidance package fuze system mortar with U.S. troops as a retrofit for the existing 60mm mortar ammunition.  The program will be divided into three phases including Preliminary and Critical Design, Brassboard Fabrication and Optimization, and Field Test and Demonstration.  Further details are provided in the RFP.

It is anticipated that an ODAM website will be established in the near future to address Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and communicate other items of interest associated with the ODAM Program.  It is furthermore anticipated that such website will be established at the following address:   http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit.htm.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Triosyn Corporation, 1191 Sourth Brownell Road, Williston, Vermont 05495.  Triosyn is the only qualified source to conduct this effort.  This procurement addresses the need to develop the next generation of individual and collective protection filters with anti-microbial properties.  The primary objective is to continue research and development of improved biocidal air filtration media for individual/collective protection applications.  Technical objectives aim at developing and optimizing pre-industrialization-stage individual and collective protection prototype filters to achieve satisfactory disinfection of air at reduced pressure-drop values and to specifically address the optimization of biocidal capacity and longevity at varying face velocities and under realistic environmental conditions.  The resulting technology will provide downstream biocidal efficacy greater than 99.999% against microbial challenges while maintaining an acceptable pressure drop during an 8-hour period of exposure.  
Additional tasks in the outyears may involve development of a suite of reactive materials for use in filters, garments, and protective equipment for control of incidental and malicious infection and neutralization of chemical warfare agents. This is a follow on acquisition.  Contracts F08637-02-C-7018 and F08630-03-C-0113 were awarded to Triosyn Corp. as the result of proposals submitted under Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) for FY 02 and 03.  Under F08637-02-C-7018 the contractor established feasibility by assembling and testing a series of engineering models of a clip-on augmentation to COTS C2A1 canisters.  Under Contract F08630-03-C-0113, the contractor matured the technology focusing on midstream design and testing of a prototype assembled by modifying a C2A1 canister, initial development of an advanced prototype aimed at replacing the C2A1, and early development and testing of 2x2 HVAC filters.       
Triosyn Corp was the only company to submit anti-microbial filter proposals to AFRL/MLQF under the 02, 03 and 04 BAAs.  The proposed sole source contract will continue the work begun by these earlier contracts, further developing the technology toward transition.  This is a congressionally funded program. The FY 04 budget appropriations document stated:  "Integrating the Triosyn technology into air filtration material provides crucial and enhanced protection to our service members, especially under conditions emanating from a crisis under a Weapons of Mass Destruction scenario.  This program will introduce a new generation of interactive NBC Individual and Collective air filtration protection products enabling continuous WMD operations." Triosyn Corporation holds the patents for reactive iodinated filter media, which are the focus of the research program.  As the technology is not licensed to any other vendor, there is no other company who can produce the filter media and continue this work.
The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) demonstrating their experience with formulation, fabrication, leak testing and toxicological evaluation of air filters containing thermal-fused iodinated polymers, to include proof of licenses to patents and ownership of equipment to be used to validate measurements of broad-spectrum anti-microbial efficacy of the Triosyn iodinated filters. The estimated period of performance will not exceed 5 years.    The funding profile for this effort is FY 04   $1.8.  Funding for FY 05, 06, 07, and 08 is uncertain. The entire effort under this contract will not exceed $35M. The Government anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with CPFF tasks.  If requirements exist beyond FY 04, additional tasksorders will be issued.       Submit SOC within 45 days of publication, to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn:  Brenda Soler, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.  For technical information contact Joe Wander, AFRL/MLQF at (850) 283-6240, joe.wander@tyndall.af.mil  for contractual questions contact Brenda Soler, Contracting Officer at (850) 882-4294, ext. 3406.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is the first mission under the Living With a Star (LW) Program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA’s understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will have a mission life of 5 years. NASA/GSFC is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding Ka-band Power Amplifier(s), for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project.  The present requirements are specified in the attached documents: Exhibit 1 – DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) 464-COMM-LEGL-0032, entitled “Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project Ka-band Power Amplifier.” Exhibit 2 – DRAFT Performance Specification 464-COMM-SPEC-0074, entitled “SDO Ka-band Power Amplifier.” This notice is issued by the NASA/GSFC to post a DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT Performance Specification via the internet, and to solicit input and recommendations from interested parties.  The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA/GSFC’s knowledge of industry’s capabilities.  NASA/GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility, and to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project personnel.  This procedure is described within FAR Part 15.202.  The intent of each session is to provide dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA/GSFC’s requirements, and on its acquisition approach.  The compilation of submitted information may be factored along with SDO requirements to refine the aforementioned Draft SOW (Exhibit 1) and the Draft Performance Specification (Exhibit 2). Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement, that includes: 1.  Capability to comply with current requirements outlined in the Draft Performance Specification and SOW.  Any Spec/SOW Requirement that yields a non-compliant response must be clearly-noted and accompanied with brief comments that either describe how a potential offeror’s Ka-band Power Amplifier could be brought into compliance, or state why unit(s) will remain non-compliant.	This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one feedback sessions.  Interested firms should also state whether certain requirements are cost drivers, increase risk, and address whether or not a Fixed-Price contract would be acceptable; 2.  Show capability to meet the DILS hardware deliverable schedule and; 3.	Provide a summary of relevant Past Experience in developing Ka-band Power Amplifier(s).  In addition, please identify whether Firm is a Small or Large Business. This notice constitutes all information concerning the SDO Ka-band Power Amplifier(s), that will be furnished at this time.  Interested firms are requested to submit their capability Statement to Ms. Pearl Wray, at NASA/GSFC, Mail Code 210.9, Greenbelt, MD 20771, or via e-mail: Pearlene.Wray-1@nasa.gov .

Powers, at NASA/GSFC, Code 567.0, Greenbelt, MD 20771, or via e-mail:  Michael.K.Powers@nasa.gov.  When responding to this RFI, please reference number (RFI-SDO-GBJ-001). This pre-solicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any information submitted in response to the RFI.  Respondents will not be notified of the final results from any one-on-one discussions.  An ombudsman has been appointed – See NASA Specific Note “B”.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the internet.

<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking organizations with clinical and technical expertise and facilities to advance the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) clinical research mission through the provision of flexible research management support services and activities at multiple levels to facilitate a complex and rapidly evolving global research agenda.  This project is being solicited under full-and-open competition under NAICS 541710 but this decision may be subject to change following the final review by the NIH Small Business Officer.  A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held to provide potential offerors an opportunity to participate in a discussion of the requirements identified in this RFP.  The date for the pre-proposal conference will be listed in the solicitation. The DAIDS is seeking a contractor to provide a set of Core Functions that will constitute a comprehensive Centralized Clinical Research Program Management Center to support multiple Phase I, II and III HIV clinical research efforts.  The functions designated as “Core” in the SOW provide critical oversight and management of clinical trial operations that are vital to the DAIDS mission and include centralized clinical research program management subcontract acquisition and management, and contract transition.  Therefore, only offerors that propose to perform the functions designated as “Core Functions” within their own organization (not subcontracted out) will be considered for Technical Evaluation.  A second component of the proposed contract is comprised of a set of “Non-Core Functions” that are highly specialized activities, with the emphasis being on the contractor’s ability to provide rapid response to requests to perform these Non-Core Functions either through subcontracts or assuming the additional work in-house for a variety of support to the Division of AIDS Network and non-Network activities.   It is important to note that these Non-Core Functions cannot be quantified at this time but rather can only be defined as a general set of clinical trials management activities that will be needed as the DAIDS portfolio evolves and the DAIDS product-development cycle continues.  All offerors responding to this solicitation will be provided with a uniform dollar assumption for the anticipated costs of subcontracting activities for Non-Core Functions.  All offerors will be directed to NOT provide any names or specific information regarding future subcontracting activities.  This critical contract will reside within a complex research environment and will require that the contractor work with a consortium of multiple clinical trial groups and DAIDS contractors.  The work will be primarily international in scope and conducted in developing countries.   Specific functions performed within this contract will vary and will be trial-specific.  The contractor must have the capacity and capability to work with DAIDS-specified grantees and contractors and must possess the ability and relevant scientific expertise to establish necessary linkages (administrative, logistical, operational, information technology, etc.) as required for sound research program management and clinical trials management.  Major Core Functions will include centralized clinical research program management, subcontract acquisition and management, and contract transition.  Major Non-Core Functions will include site management activities to include:  site identification/assessment activities (preparation, coordination, evaluation, financial management, staff recruitment, equipment and facilities management, and on-the-ground oversight); clinical trials management activities [data management, DSMB support, biostatistical support, laboratory and specialized studies support, medical writing and document generation, shipping, pharmacy support, communication support, volunteer recruitment and retention, and volunteer counseling and clinical trials compliance activities (training, regulatory activities, monitoring, quality assurance, safety monitoring].  The prime contractor must have the ability to sub-contract with a variety of expert vendors and manage those contracts.  Offerors will be evaluated on: experience in global research program management, subcontracting acquisition and management, and ability to provide support in the form of a wide variety of tasks associated with Phase I, II and III clinical trials.  Past experience in conducting complex programs and partnering with multiple entities to provide support for a clinical trial and infrastructure development and staffing, ability to obtain and provide on-the-ground staff and expertise in the conduct of clinical research in resource-constrained areas such as Southeast Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe; experience in similar projects with special emphasis on the ability to anticipate special conditions likely encountered among resource-constrained sites in developing countries; experience in working with the political and diplomatic demands of research management in international settings; ability to provide expert subcontracts for all facets of clinical trials and clinical research management; provision of IT support and infrastructure development for IT capacity in resource-constrained countries; experience in managing large complex clinical research programs and a large complement of subcontracts; location of management core of key personnel in the Washington, D.C. area; and willingness to partner with Contract Research Organizations (CROs), Site Management Organizations (SMOs), Federal entities, pharmaceutical companies, and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).   This is a new effort; there is no incumbent.  This new contract will be awarded as a cost-reimbursement, incrementally-funded type contract.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for this contract will be a total of five years with an estimated level-of-effort of 150,400 total labor hours per year (approximately 80 FTEs) with an unknown quantity of subcontracts at this time.  This RFP will be available electronically on the CMP Homepage on or about June 17, 2004, http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract/default.htm and will be posted in the FedBizOpps, http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP) Transportation Policy and Evaluation Group (TPEG) intends to award fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will  not be issued.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items and FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, apply to this  acquisition.  The Government will award a Purchase Order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation provisions, will be the most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  PURPOSE: TPEG is seeking research on  automobile buyer response to environmental labeling of vehicles which will assist in the development and implementation of a "green" vehicle label. Substantial work has been done on this general topic; the proposed project seeks to build on that work, adding elements that will meet the specific  needs of EPA in its pursuit of an effective federal labeling program. This Purchase Order will provide EPA with detailed information on consumer and stakeholder response to candidate informational and motivational labels highlighting the environmental performance of individual models of cars and  light trucks. More specifically, the objectives are to 1: Determine vehicle label content and design to maximize consumers' awareness of and interest in environmental properties of vehicles; 2. Understand views of other stakeholders (e.g., dealers, auto web sites, environmental groups) and  determine how these views should influence labeling decisions. While manufacturers are another key stakeholder group; EPA will conduct the outreach to them.; 3. Devise a near-term approach to labeling that will allow for further evolution of the label; and 4. Develop recommendations for public  outreach on the label. BACKGROUND: Many factors make development of an environmental vehicle label a complex and difficult undertaking. Buyers are considering a host of issues as they select a vehicle, of which environmental considerations are only a modest part. Consumers' views diverge widely on  the type of information that should be presented on such a label; in particular, some want "just the facts", while others prefer those facts to be synthesized into a comprehensive environmental rating of vehicles.  Existing research supports the idea that consumers are eager to have more  information on vehicles' environmental impacts. NESCAUM (Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management) found last year, on the basis of several hundred interviews, that nearly three-quarters of New England consumers favor the implementation of a green vehicle labeling program. At the same  time, research shows the need for very careful design of any such label. Oak Ridge National Laboratory held focus groups that indicated a low level of understanding of the issues, even among environmentally aware consumers, as well as diverse opinions on how this information should be presented to  the public.  Manufacturer participation in a vehicle labeling program is a prerequisite for its success.  Past outreach with the manufacturers indicates that they differ greatly in their receptivity to the idea and their preferences regarding the specifics of a green label. One of the main  challenges of this labeling effort is to meet simultaneously the needs of a diverse group of stakeholders. TASKS. TASK 1: Market Research. The Contractor shall provide EPA with information on the response to product labels, based on thorough market research and tailored to current needs of EPA. The  results will be directly and immediately applicable to EPA's effort to implement an informational point-of-sale green vehicle label. The research will be designed to lead to a label that can be enhanced to include a motivational component. The information provided under this Purchase Order will  help TPEG to: (a) Increase consumer awareness of and interest in environmental properties of automobiles; (b) Expand manufacturer offerings in green vehicles; (c) Increase purchases of environmentally preferable vehicles; and (d) Reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants.The  market research done for the project shall include extensive focus group testing and stakeholder and consumer interviews. These feedback mechanisms shall gage receptivity to specific informational labels, including those proposed by EPA and variations on them, and will also investigate interest in  a motivational label, or "seal of approval", based on the contents of the informational label. DELIVERABLE: Draft report on market research is due within 12 weeks of Purchase Order award. Final version is due 2 weeks after receiving comments from EPA. TASK 2: Label Modifications/Recommendations.  The Contractor shall collect information on the receptivity of the public and other stakeholders to the specific labeling concepts now under consideration by the EPA. (This includes issues ranging from broad questions about the importance and interpretation of various kind of information that could  appear on the label to narrow questions of label design.) The Contractor shall propose improvements/modifications to labels currently under consideration by EPA.  The label shall give sound representation of the vehicle's environmental performance, be useful and appealing to automobile purchasers,  and have the support of other stakeholders as well. In addition, the label development must be done in such a way as to facilitate, rather than impede, the possible subsequent introduction of a motivational component. DELIVERABLE: Draft report on receptivity to label and suggested modifications is  do within 12 weeks of Purchase Order award. Final version is due 2 weeks after receiving comments from EPA. TASK 3:  Public Outreach Assistance. The Contractor shall assist in the implementation of a communications/outreach plan for the roll-out of the green vehicle label.  The EPA will provide the  outreach plan to the Contractor. The goal of the plan is to build awareness for both the label and its accompanying messages.  The Contractor shall provide delivery mechanisms to reach the targeted audiences and, upon approval from EPA, use these mechanisms to disseminate the label information and  accompanying messages. DELIVERABLE: Draft report containing proposed outreach mechanisms, due date within 3 weeks of completion of Task 2 .  Final report on audiences targeted/audiences reached with label information. ESTIMATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  June 2004 through June 2005. QUOTE SUBMISSION  INSTRUCTIONS: The Offeror shall prepare a project plan (no more than 10 pages, excluding resumes) which demonstrates an understanding and ability to perform this requirement as specified in this announcement.  Submit only information necessary to demonstrate capabilities to support TPEG in its  efforts to research and conduct outreach concerning green vehicle labeling.  The use of charts, tables, and other methods to facilitate brevity of proposals is preferred.  Also, please provide three references who can evaluate performance on current contracts, or contracts completed not more than  three years ago, from a customer's perspective. In addition, please submit a labor-hour quote, which includes a ceiling price, for this requirement. Include  proposed amounts for any indirect costs and other direct costs (ODCs), including travel. For cost purposes, please use $37,000 as an estimate  for ODCs and $5,000.00 for travel.  In addition, the Government's total estimated level of effort for this requirement is approximately 500 hours, with 250 hours estimated for Task 1, 100 hours for Task 2 and 150 hours for Task 3. An electronic copy shall be submitted by June 15, 2004  to  rodgers.jami@epa.gov and to the Simplified Acquisition Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), Kristin Kenausis, at kenausis.kristin@epa.gov.  Please follow up by submitting a signed original to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, ATTN: Jami Rodgers, 3803R,  Washington, DC 20460. EVALUATION FACTORS: The Government intends to make award to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the Request for Quote (RFQ) and is most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered. For this requirement, all evaluation factors other than price,  when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The technical evaluation criteria, which are in descending order of importance, are as follows: 1.Technical Merit: The Offeror shall demonstrate the level of knowledge in understanding green vehicle labeling, and the expertise to work  with labeling stakeholders and public outreach campaigns. 2. Past Performance: The Offeror shall demonstrate expertise relevant to market research of product labeling and public outreach assistance.  Timeliness, responsiveness, professionalism, and cost control will be considered. 3. Personnel: The  Offeror shall demonstrate the staffing and management approach for all tasks, including education, relevant experience, certifications, and capabilities of the personnel proposed by the Offeror to demonstrate their approach for managing work similar in nature to this requirement. 5. Cost/Price. The  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541620. Any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement stated herein may submit a proposal, which if received by the response date of this announcement will be considered. All questions should be  directed to Jami Rodgers via e-mail at rodgers.jami@epa.gov.

<DESC>AIRBORNE SYNTHETIC TACTICAL RADAR (ASTR) – REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  The Naval Aviation Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) is seeking information and conducting a market research to identify and evaluate innovative approaches and products to determine the feasibility of implementing an on-board integrated airborne synthetic tactical fire-control radar as part of the training solution for Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) at NAS Pensacola, FL. Ultimately, the training solution is for an affordable replacement for the T-39 aircraft and associated ground-based training system (GBTS) to meet the needs of future Military Flight Officers (MFOs), while improving training effectiveness, supportability, flexibility, and costs to operate.  The core of the T-39 Training System mission is to provide Naval Flight Officers, Air Force Navigators and International MFOs with the required knowledge, skills and abilities to succeed in their follow-on advanced phase of training in the Fleet Replacement Squadrons, Air Force Replacement Training Units and equivalent international training phases, respectively.  The T-39 Training System fulfills the basic requirements for tactical aircraft assignments in Strike Warfare, Strike Fighter Warfare, Airborne Electronic Warfare, and Airborne Early Warning.  The successful graduate is qualified in the fundamentals of airways and low-level navigation, communication, air-to-air intercept, ground mapping radar employment, and crew resource management.  MFO training resources will be impacted by the expiration of the service life for the T-39 fleet due to fatigue limits on the wing and fuselage.   In addition, requirements will be impacted with the planned retirements of the F-14, EA-6B, and S-3, while the Navy fleet transitions to the F/A-18E/F/G.  The next evolution for MFO undergraduate training requirements is currently being determined by the training community via a bottoms-up analysis of MFO skill sets, along with the development of implementation options.   In a parallel effort, NAVAIR is investigating the technical feasibility of implementing a synthetic tactical fire-control radar capability into an existing training platform, the T-45C Goshawk. The T-45C is to receive the following avionic upgrades; Smart Multi-Function Color Display in FY07 and a next generation Mission Display Processor (MDP) in FY06.  The MDP is a VME, Commercial off the shelf (COTS), open architecture system with expanded Input/Output and memory.   REQUIREMENTS:  The synthetic tactical fire-control radar must be representative of current or future deployed U.S. Navy or U.S. Air Force tactical fire-control radar capable of both air-to-air and air-to-ground modes, including Real Beam Ground Mapping (RBGM), Doppler Beam Sharpening (DBS), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as well as Medium Pulse Repetition Frequency (MPRF) Range While Search (RWS) and Pulse Doppler Single Target Track (PDSTT) targeting modes. An on-board integrated solution in the T-45C platform is desired.   Capabilities for data recording to support post-flight debrief are desired.  It is anticipated that the first kit to will integrated and tested in the FY06/07 timeframe. DISCUSSION POINTS: (a) Mitigation of limitations associated with visual correlation between simulated terrain and out-the-window terrain, specifically man-made cultural features and moving targets;  (b) The feasibility of detecting and incorporating real air traffic, targets of opportunity, into the radar display; (c) Safety-of-flight issues and risks; (d) Limitations of simulating radar phenomena and effects (atmospheric degradation, shadows, far shore brightening, sidelobe effects, seasonal effects, basic electronic countermeasures (ECM), etc.);  and (e) Simulating radar pre-flight and post-flight activities (BIT checks, operational checks, start-up and shut-down procedures, etc.)  DELIVERABLES: This request is for information only and shall be provided at no cost to the Government. NAVAIR seeks conceptual papers, technology availability/maturity, identification of risks, product descriptions and price, identification of cost drivers, addressing all or any part of the requirements or discussion points detailed above.  In addition, provide suggestions on ways to enhance and/or sustain competition.  Information presented need not be limited to that specifically described herein.  Ensure your submission identifies a corporate a point of contact. Please provide one hardcopy, and one compact disk copy of your submission to the NAVAIR Contracting Officer identified above.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS, NOR DOES NAVAIR INTEND TO AWARD ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/ MARKET RESEARCH OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>15--T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP)
<SOLNBR>FA8617-04-R-6154
<ARCHDATE>07302005
<CONTACT>James Van Oss,937-904-4192
<DESC>UPDATE (6-4-04) Request for Information  All interested parties are asked to respond to this RFI.  The Air Force is employing an incremental approach for the T38-C Escape System  Upgrade Program (ESUP), consisting of two increments.  Increment One:   encompasses the integration, production, and installation of an escape system  comprised of two seats and an inter-seat sequencing system (ISS) with improved  escape system performance as the primary requirement and increased  accommodation as the goal.  Increment Two:  includes any changes required to  the cockpit and/or airframe to expand the aircrew population capable of safely  and effectively operating the T38-C.  The requirement for the second increment  is to expand the aircrew population to accommodate the individuals encompassed  by JPATS Cases 1-6.  However, the goal is to also accommodate individuals in  JPATS Case 7.    While the first increment is the focus of the acquisition strategy for the  forthcoming RFP and subsequent source selection, it is imperative the  seats/inter-seat sequencing system do not adversely affect the Air Force+s  ability to accomplish the second increment.   From a systems engineering  perspective, integrating the seats and ISS without considering the changes  required to fulfill the requirement of Increment 2 greatly increases the  potential for extra work, increased expenses, and/or even failure in the second  increment.   The Air Force must consider this risk and attempt to mitigate it.  Thus, the Air Force solicits responses from all interested parties for the  following questions: 1. What process would you use to evaluate the impact of an Increment 1 solution  on the ability of the Air Force to accomplish Increment 2? 2. Similarly, in what way might the Air Force assess the degree to which a  particular seat/ISS system would contribute to the effective implementation of  Increment 2? 3. How would you recommend that this systems engineering concern be addressed  in the RFP?      Please respond to this RFI by providing one (1) hard copy and one (1)  electronic copy to the contractual point of contact (POC) by 3:00 pm local time  on 18 June 2004.  Any questions regarding this RFI or the ESUP program may be  addressed to the contractual POC listed below. Contractual POC:  James Van Oss, ASC/YTA, Building 11A, Room 201-I, 1970  Monahan Way, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7211, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  (937) 904-4192. //End of Update// UPDATE (5-28-04) Request for Information All interested parties are asked to respond to this RFI.  The purpose of this  RFI is to provide an update on the current acquisition strategy, and to solicit  candid responses from potential T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP)  offerors.  The Government is seeking to gain insight into any potential problem  areas that may result from the current strategy and to address several  important contractual issues identified during the strategy development  process.  Please answer and provide detailed information in the outline format  below to support your position in the following areas: 1.  The overall requirement for the T-38C ESUP is to upgrade the entire T-38C  fleet (509 aircraft).  Due to various constraints, the Government plans to  initially modify only 199 aircraft located at three (3) AETC bases.  The  upgraded escape systems will be acquired under an Indefinite  Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract as a nondevelopmental item (NDI)  and on a firm fixed priced basis.  An item shall be considered NDI if it meets  the definition of NDI as it is defined in FAR 2.101 and based upon the accepted  government performance standard for escape systems. The IDIQ contract will have  a five-year ordering period with variable quantity bands and a "most probable  quantity".  Although the Government currently anticipates a production and  installation rate of five (5) shipsets per month (60 per year), the quantity  bands will be structured with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate  the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding. a.  Address the 5-year fixed priced, IDIQ arrangement.  Do you see any problems  with being able to price this NDI effort? Will your company commit, and  contract for, firm fixed prices for a full five-year period?   If not, clearly  identify your concerns in your response.  b.  If increased Government resources become available, i.e., increased funding  and an increased number of aircraft available for the upgrade each month, the  Government may seek to accelerate the production and installation rate in order  to upgrade up-to-509 aircraft during the 5-year ordering period.  How large an  increase in monthly production could your current production capabilities  sustain?  In other words, what are the maximum monthly quantities you could  produce?    c.  In the event funding is stretched out, what are the minimum monthly  quantities you require to maintain a profitable production line?    d.  How soon after RFP release would a "production representative" seat be  ready for the Government+s measurements and testing in the T-38C mock-up?   e.  How soon after contract award would you be able to provide shipsets for  integration testing?  How soon after integration testing is completed would you  be able to begin delivering shipsets at a minimum rate of 5 shipsets per month? 2.  The following questions deal with several contractual issues identified by  the Government during the strategy development process: a.  It is the Government's intent to acquire material and workmanship  warranty.  If you propose an essential performance warranty on the ESUP, please  explain in detail.  Address fully how you envision the warranty and sustainment  to operate for this program. b.  FAR Clause 52.225-1 -- Buy American Act-Supplies (June 2003) will be  included in Section I - Contract Clauses and FAR Clause 52.225-2 - Buy American  Act Certificate (June 2003) will be included in Section K - Representations and  Certifications of the RFP and the resultant contract.  Please address how you  will comply with the Buy American Act and discuss how your company will  complete the Buy American Act certificate contained in FAR 52.225-2.   c.  Section I of the RFP will also include DFARS Clause 252.225-7012 and 7014,  Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities and Preference for Domestic  Specialty Metals - Alternate I, respectively.  Similar to paragraph c. above,  please address how you will comply with these clauses and what affect these  clauses will have on the structure of your program, if any. d.  Lastly, Section I of the RFP will contain DFARS Clause 252.211-7003 - Item  Identification and Valuation (Jan 2004).  Identify your current ability to meet  the Unique Identification (UID) requirement or how you will be able to meet  this requirement at the time of contract award.  Please see the UID website  http://www.acq.osd.mil/uid/ for details.   Please respond to this RFI by providing one (1) hard copy and one (1)  electronic copy to the contractual point of contact (POC) by 3:00 pm local time  on 17 June 2004.  Please adhere to the outline format provided above in your  response.  Any questions regarding this RFI or the ESUP program may be  addressed to the contractual POC listed below. Contractual POC:  James Van Oss, ASC/YTA, Building 11A, Room 201-I, 1970  Monahan Way, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7211, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  (937) 904-4192. //End of Update// Update (5-3-2004) DELETION OF ESCAPE PATH CLEARANCE The acquisition strategy for the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program continues  to evolve.  After reviewing the operational needs of AETC, as well as non- developmental technologies that currently exist, ASC/YTA has decided there is  no need for a separate, second ESUP increment dedicated to escape path  clearance.  As a result of this decision, associated funding for this increment  will not be made available.   The T-38C ESUP will now consist of only two increments.  Increment 1 will  remain essentially the same as it was previously, integration of non- developmental ejection seats and inter-seat sequencing.  The former third  increment, upgrade of the aircrew accommodation, will now become Increment 2. P.O.C: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil, 937-904- 4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433-7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (4-05-04) ANNOUNCEMENT OF FORMAL SOURCES SOUGHT This notification announces the commencement of a formal Sources Sought for the  T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP), Solicitation No. FA8617-04-R-6154.   The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine whether there are additional  offerors interested in this program and to finalize the Government+s pre- solicitation market research.  As part of this acquisition, the Government  intends to upgrade the current T-38C escape system including the aircraft's  ejection seats and inter-seat sequencing, as well as escape path clearance.   The Government plans to upgrade a minimum of 199 aircraft, but may upgrade up  to 509 aircraft.  Formal technical performance parameters will be released with  the draft RFP.  Please review previous announcements and attachments for  additional background information (posted below, if using the PIXS website, or  available on the FedBizOpps website).    Offerors who responded to previous Requests for Information (RFIs), dated 06  Mar 2002, 3 Oct 2003, and 9 Jan 2004, or attended either of the two Industry  Days held on 29 Sep 2003 and 9 Mar 2004 need not respond to this notification.   Only unidentified offerors who have not previously responded nor participated  to date should submit a letter of interest to the Government at this time.  The  Government also requests that you respond to the questions posed in the RFIs  dated 3 Oct 2003 and 9 Feb 2004 as part of your submission.  Interested parties  are requested to submit a letter of interest via email or hard copy to the  individual listed below no later than 20 Apr 2004 at 3:00 pm local time.  In  addition, the Government requests that the responses to the RFIs be provided  via email or hard copy no later than 5 May 2004 at 3:00 pm local time.  This  sources sought notice does not constitute a solicitation for proposals and no  contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement.  Important  Reminder:  Again, letters of interest and RFI responses are not required from  those who have previously responded to the RFIs or have attended the Industry  Days.   Please direct any questions regarding your status as an offeror or any other  aspect of this program to the individual listed below.   Discussions with Industry conducted through previous RFIs and Industry Days  have aided the Government in the development of its current acquisition  strategy.  The current strategy is to compete the T-38 ESUP program as a  nondevelopmental item (NDI) acquisition to the maximum extent practicable,  using a FAR Part 15, Full Trade-Off (FTO), best value, competitive source  selection.  If the acquisition strategy changes or evolves differently,  Industry will be notified accordingly. The Government anticipates posting a draft solicitation within the next 60-90  days for the T-38 ESUP acquisition.  Comments from Industry on the draft  version will be solicited at that time to aid in the preparation and release of  the final request for proposal.  Please monitor the PIXS website and FedBizOpps  (www.fbo.gov) for further updates. P.O.C: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil, 937-904- 4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433-7211.  ///END OF UPDATE/// UPDATE (2-26-04) CHANGE OF LOCATION FOR THE MARCH 9TH INDUSTRY DAY Due to the increased interest in this program, we have changed locations to  accommodate all those that wish to attend.

All  responses to this document are requested NLT 5 July 2004. _________________________________________________ The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson  AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to  perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS)  Contractor Logistics Support  (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 Jan  2007. BACKGROUND GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon  Aircraft Corporation as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS  CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The  GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the  maximum student and instructor training load at each training site The GBTS has  three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and  the Training Integration Management System (TIMS). There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training  operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students  normal and emergency procedures as defined in the JPPT syllabus.  All three  utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full  functioning replica of the T-6A front seat cockpit and the same Instructor  Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC  computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing  system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the  devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device  (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33  degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.   Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 Visual Control Computer  and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.   The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five. The other two ATD's are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and  include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer  (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning  instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that  replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of  the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection  procedures.   A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been  properly initiated. The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their  associated syllabi.  The T-6A Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6A  Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how  to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using  Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate  training platforms. TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying  training programs (T-6A, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates  on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.   Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application  server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual  Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).   CURRENT ENVIRONMENT RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components. On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and  NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required  manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of  95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.   The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy  location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes  Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are  tracked using Magic Service Desk. On-Site TIMS CAI support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB,  Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.

All  responses to this document are requested NLT 5 July 2004. _________________________________________________ The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson  AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to  perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS)  Contractor Logistics Support  (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 Jan  2007. BACKGROUND GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon  Aircraft Corporation as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS  CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The  GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the  maximum student and instructor training load at each training site The GBTS has  three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and  the Training Integration Management System (TIMS). There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training  operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students  normal and emergency procedures as defined in the JPPT syllabus.  All three  utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full  functioning replica of the T-6A front seat cockpit and the same Instructor  Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC  computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing  system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the  devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device  (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33  degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.   Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 Visual Control Computer  and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.   The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five. The other two ATD's are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and  include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer  (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning  instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that  replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of  the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection  procedures.

The courseware was developed using  Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate  training platforms. TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying  training programs (T-6A, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates  on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.

<DESC>NOTE:  PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 6 BELOW REGARDING POINT OF CONTACT FOR QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES IN REGARD TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.


1.  INTRODUCTION:  

a.  This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Department of Defense is not seeking proposals, and will not accept any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party’s expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP.  If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this and any other pertinent website for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

b.  The RFI process will be conducted in two phases.   The first phase is a request for information only and will allow the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) team to select representative candidates from each category for estimating program cost and effectiveness.  As part of the first phase, the AoA team may conduct an information exchange meeting with representative companies under each of the alternatives cited in Paragraph 2, below.  It is anticipated that these meetings will take place in the July timeframe.  The second phase will be a request for cost and pricing data from the representative candidates under each alternative.  As stated in Paragraph a., this does not constitute an RFP.  Life cycle costing information will strictly be used as an aid in ascertaining a Government estimate for these candidate representative solutions as a means to completion of the required Economic Analysis.  .

2.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support an AoA for the sourcing/procurement capability of the Department of Defense (DOD).  The Government is looking for information in four categories:  (1) firms that have the resources (hardware, software, people, facilities) available which would allow the Government to out-source the capability; (2) Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) products capable of fulfilling DOD’s needs; (3) a combination of categories (1) and (2); and (4) development of a solution that would fulfill DoD’s sourcing needs within the stated timeframe.

3.  BACKGROUND:  As part of the Acquisition Domain’s transformation initiative and in support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Business Management Modernization Program (BMMP), an AoA for the Acquisition Domain, sourcing/procurement process has been launched.  This AoA is in support of a Milestone A decision (Concept Refinement Phase).  In conjunction with this effort, OSD will assess and define required Acquisition Domain capabilities and develop an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) with JROC (Joint Requirements Oversight Council) approval/validation.  The AoA will assess suitable IT alternatives for the future Acquisition Domain capabilities identified in the ICD.  This is a significant Domain undertaking -- one that will serve to shape and directly influence the way the DOD does business in the future.  The AoA is being led by the Air Force on behalf of OSD; however, it is a joint effort with representatives from the Military Departments and Defense Agencies.

The DoD Acquisition Domain (Sourcing) (DADS) initiative, as envisioned, will enable the DoD to acquire services, supplies, construction, and financial assistance in support of its mission in a standardized, seamless, end-to-end (E2E) shared data environment.  DADS will also support mission related assistance through the use of such instruments as grants and cooperative agreements.

4.  TIMEFRAMES:  For planning purposes, the AoA being conducted is in support of a Milestone A (Concept Refinement Phase) decision scheduled for December 2005.   

a.  Based upon this schedule, it is anticipated that vendors responding to capabilities described under Categories 1 and 2 in Paragraph 2, above, will be deployed in mid-2010.  

b.  For responses to capabilities described under Categories 3 and 4, in Paragraph 2, above, the Government will entertain a spiral/modular solution with an initial deployment.  Responses in these two categories should indicate the timeframe to complete deployment of the full operational capabilities. 

5.  CAPABILITIES:  Attachment A is the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) setting forth the required capabilities.  The following paragraphs synopsize this document.  Websites containing information referenced herein, and in the ICD, are contained in Paragraph 8.  Those responding to this request,  must categorize responses by identifying capabilities that currently exist, capabilities currently under development, and capabilities that can be planned and scheduled.  For each of these three categories, responses are expected to address each subparagraph below.  All responses must be accompanied by a plan addressing the approach, including a schedule, which describes the candidate technology and proposed approach for the DoD Sourcing environment, method of supply/delivery  (e.g. full delivery or spiral delivery with proposed approach to provide full capability). training, deployment, maintenance and sustainment.  Responses are not to exceed the maximum equivalent of 75 pages, including schedules.

For those solutions currently in use within the Federal Government, provide the names of the agencies, the approximate number of users of the system, and a point of contact at the agency.  In addition, briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant (not to exceed the equivalent of 5 pages).  Address and provide a full description of any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, security requirements, security assurance processes, and any relevant lessons learned (not to exceed the equivalent of 2 pages per project).


a.  The solution must include a database, document generator and document manager capability (produce and manage documents by accessing data in the database) and must contain a flexible, near real-time and batch interface capability to both internal and external systems.

b.  The solution must facilitate improved acquisition cycles such that single transaction data entry is utilized to ensure data consistency throughout the entire solution and the time/steps to generate/process an action are minimized.  As part of this capability, the solution must provide the most streamlined method of generating, processing and tracking sourcing actions through an automated routing and/or automated population means.
 
c.  The solution must execute DoD acquisition instruments, business rules and formats (including but not limited to: FAR/DFARS, non-FAR, DoDGAR, non-appropriated funds (NAF) instruments, Government-wide Purchase Card transactions)

d.  Standard shared data must be available through the entire acquisition process from the development of an acquisition strategy to the final disposal of property and archiving of records.

e.  The solution must be interoperable with other appropriate systems such as foreign or domestic partners (e.g., finance, logistics, contractors/vendors), without the use of specialized networks.  It must provide data interaction across DoD sourcing communities/users.

f.  The solution must accommodate automated closeout activities.

g.  The solution must be supportable and useable. In support of this item, provide a supportability/usability plan which addresses elements such as Section 508 compliance, operating in contingency/fleet and remote conditions, records management as defined in DOD STD 5015.2, NARA.

h.  The solution must comply with the requirements of the Global Information Grid (GIG) architecture and must meet Government accreditation and certification standards such as JITC and CJCSI 6212.01B.

l.	The solution must accommodate analysis of data and permit standard, as well as
 ad-hoc, query report options.

m.  In order to provide data for the agency's data warehouse and Business Intelligence capabilities, the agency requires complete access to all data created and/or stored by the proposed solution.  In addition, a complete description of the data stored by the application, whether as a data dictionary or as metadata, will be required. Access to the data, and a description of the data, are required to support routine extractions and movement of the information into the agency's data repositories.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), Pittsburgh, PA, intends to negotiate a sole source, firm-fixed price contract with Motorola to provide and install a VHF digital radio system to meet narrowband radio communication requirements.

The VAPHS also has existing Motorola hand-held radios that can be re-programmed to narrowband configuration.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notice to the Contracting Officer NLT June 17, 2004 (C.O.B.).  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  Information may be sent to Linda Glancy (04A-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206 or e-mailed to Linda.Glancy@med.va.gov.

<RESPDATE>061804
<CONTACT>Thais Campbell, 202-385-8426
<DESC>The FAA Oceanic and Offshore Integrated Product Team has developed and deployed the Microprocessor Enroute Automated Radar Tracking System (MEARTS).  This system receives and integrates radar data from multiple sensors and displays the information for use in control of air traffic.  MEARTS is currently installed in nine FAA and Department of Defense locations and at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) and the FAA Academy. The MEARTS was developed and installed, and is maintained by, the Lockheed Martin Corporation under a five year contract that was awarded in December 1994.  The contract was subsequently extended until December 2004.  This procurement will be for services to maintain the MEARTS for five years.  Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMCO) is the current contractor providing these services; therefore, LMCO will not be required to submit documentation evidencing their capabilities. The potential contractor must have expert knowledge of the MEARTS and the MEARTS air traffic control environment and must have the capability to develop, maintain, archive, and control access to MEARTS source code through an established configuration controlled process.  The contractor must have expert knowledge of all MEARTS external interfaces, i.e. flight data processors, Minimally Attended Radars (MAR-1 and MAR-4), ARSR-3, ARSR-4, ASR-9, ASR-11, common digitizers, the Capstone Communication and Control system, SITA, NADIN, and WARP.  The contractor must maintain a logistic and depot capability that supports all MEARTS sites.  Minimum technical hardware and software capability requirements include: 1.	Complete MEARTS software and hardware maintenance and testing capability adaptable to emulate all MEARTS facilities; 2.	An established software maintenance infrastructure allowing simultaneous access to MEARTS source code by both contractor and government organizations while protecting the confidentiality, configuration, and integrity of baselined and in-process modification  copies; 3.	The contractor must be able to dispatch properly trained and qualified support personnel, as necessary, to any MEARTS facility on 24 hour notice to restore MEARTS service; 4.	Expert knowledge of MEARTS software and hardware and established procedures for maintenance and modification of MEARTS software or hardware; 5.	Recent experience developing and maintaining a NAS certified operational Radar Data Processor capable of integrating primary and secondary radar, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Addressed, and NEXRAD weather radar sensor inputs; 6.	ISO-9001 certification; 7.	Recent experience operating a contractor depot logistics system. The vendor will be required to furnish labor, facility, materials, special tools, parts, and test equipment to perform software and hardware maintenance and Contractor Maintenance and Logistic Support at all MEARTS sites and support facilities.  MEARTS contains some proprietary software and the vendor will have to negotiate with LMCO for use of this software.  Alternatively, the vendor may recreate the functionality.  The anticipated contract type for this procurement is Time and Material.  The total period of performance is five years, and the total estimated cost is $20,000,000. Interested vendors shall respond with a technical statement of experience and proven capabilities of working technically equivalent systems in a similar environment, and proven record of providing timely and efficient support services.  Vendors must address all items 1-7 above.  Vendors shall also provide a transition plan detailing steps needed to transfer the sustainment work without impacting the schedule of fixes to software troubles or impacting the maintenance of the system hardware at the sites.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to the announcement.  Any proprietary information should be marked.  Also, this announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responses must be received NLT June 18, 2004. If interested and capable of meeting all requirements, please contact the Contracting Officer, Ms. Thais Y. Davis-Campbell via e-mail at Thais.Campbell@faa.gov.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for other than commercial items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for Two-dimensional simulation studies of wide-bandgap heterojunction devices for microwave power amplifiers, (SiC and GaN). Background: NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has been working in the field of wide-bandgap semiconductor devices for future high frequency, high power devices.  Numerical simulation is essential for guidance in design, and corroboration of measurements in the lab.  We have been using the software package from SILVACO DATA SYSTEMS, INC., and seek to continue along this path.  This solicitation is for simulation services using the above mentioned software. Objective:   The Contractor shall perform the tasks listed below.  Required input data for Silvaco ATLAS and Monte Carlo (MOCASIM) simulations will be provided by NASA-Glenn. Tasks:	 1.	The Contractor shall investigate reliability issues of AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs):  current collapse, knee walk-out, and Schottky gate leakage at the onset of radio frequency (RF) power saturation.	This requires incorporating various traps in different locations in the device, and observing the above phenomena as a function of radio frequency drive and temperature.  Next, the Contractor shall develop a solution to these problems that will be tried by incorporating a second gate (or field plate) near the drain contact.	The size, position, and bias values shall be examined to see if mitigation of the above problems is possible.   2.	The Contractor shall test the improved modeling scheme in ATLAS for AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, which uses multiple charge sheets to correctly model the polarization field which creates the 2D quantum well.  Next, the Contractor shall ascertain the ability to create the desired band structures for different doping and layer designs.  Then the Contractor shall determine the quantum levels accurately, such that the developed current-voltage characteristics are similar to those envisioned by that design.  Finally, the Contractor shall determine the temperature effects on the above quantities, using the thermal subroutine GIGA.   3.	The Contractor shall test the improved model for RF current collapse, and its mitigation by a field plate.    The Contractor shall generate graphs, plots, and charts to facilitate display of the results.  The Contractor shall interact with NASA-Glenn technical point of contact at least once a week.  The interaction shall occur at GRC, when requested by the NASA technical point of contact.  Requirement for Descriptive Literature: In order to ascertain that the Contractor can adequately perform the minimum tasks prospective, the Contractor shall furnish the following descriptive literature items with their quotation for technical evaluation prior to selection: 1.	The Contractor shall provide a printout or CD of the material file and device structure definition file that the bidder used to perform a 4H-SiC or 6H-SiC field-effect transistor simulation, or a GaN HEMT simulation, using Silvaco software. 2.	The Contractor shall provide a color two-dimension Silvaco TonyPlot printout or postscript file of the field-effect channel charge carrier concentration that the bidder simulated during a 4H-SiC or 6H-SiC field-effect transistor or HEMT simulation.  This plot shall encompass the source, drain, and channel region of the device, and shall be plotted on a logarithmic carrier concentration scale.  The plot shall include a numerical color scale plot legend. 3.	The Contractor shall provide printout of an RF simulation, giving S-parameters for both a standard design and a modified one using a field plate. Failure to provide either of the above-specified items shall render the bid non-responsive.  The files and plots will be evaluated for accuracy and clarity relative to known SiC and GaN device behaviors.	 Deliverables: This shall be a fixed price order.  The deliverables consist of files for each task, Tonyplots of requested items for specific runs, and two interim reports summarizing the results.  The first interim report shall be due 7 weeks after receipt of order.  The second interim report shall be due 14 weeks after receipt of order.  A final report is needed to document the overall effort; as well as indicate directions for future investigations.  All reports shall consist of text and Tonyplots, and other graphs and tables as needed, that explain and summarizes the outcomes for each of the tasks considered for that reporting period.	  Best Value Characteristics The following value characteristics are applicable to this procurement; 1.	Technical Strength of Approach. 2.	Demonstrated ability to work efficiently with SILVACO tools. 3.	Demonstrated ability to adjust parameters for fast convergence; especially in the quantum level calculations. 4.	Experience of applying the tools to nitride compounds. Period of Performance: The period of performance for this effort shall be five months after receipt of order. **NOTE TO PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: OFFEROR MUST INCLUDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR OFFER MEETS THE ABOVE STATEMENT OF WORK**  This procurement is a total small business set-aside.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is seeking proposals from parties for construction inspection and testing services on earth fill pond projects in Marion and Clackamas Counties, Oregon. Designs for the ponds have been completed by NRCS including sizing, layout, elevations and slopes and earth compaction requirements.  Compacted earth linings have been designed for the manure storage ponds to limit exfiltration to no more than 10-6 cm/sec under the hydraulic head on the lining.

The projects are to include the following:

1.	Wildlife pond, south east of Silverton, OR:  Small, non-regulatory earth fill dam (no more than 10-ft. high and 9.2 acre-ft. storage).  Construction includes stripping, excavation of key below dam location and site approval by NRCS geologist before work continues, earth fill embankment (estimated fill quantity of the 10-ft. maximum height fill is 1600 CY with on-site materials), and final grading.  A concrete box spillway and outlet pipe is also to be constructed and construction is to be inspected by NRCS personnel but could be inspected by the inspection firm if certified for reinforced concrete inspection (forms and concrete testing).
	
2.	Manure pond, south of Oregon City, OR:  An existing two cell manure pond is to be cleaned and Cell No. 1 restored to original lines without further work.  Existing Cell No. 2 is to be enlarged from approximately 2.5 acre-feet to 14 acre-feet capacity and a compacted earth liner installed.  The estimated excavation is 23,000 CY and the compacted fill is 11,300 CY.  A compacted earth liner, consisting of two 6-inch lifts compacted to 95 percent of the maximum dry density using the Standard Proctor test is to be installed.
	
3.	Manure pond, north of Salem, OR:  A new two cell manure pond is to be constructed in an existing field.  The pond will be partially cut and partially fill with an estimated cut of 15,000 CY and a fill of 15,000 CY.  A compacted earth liner, consisting of two 6-in. lifts compacted to 98 percent of the maximum dry density of the Standard Proctor test is to be installed.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) is soliciting for services to provide all commercial aviation flight schedule data (passenger/cargo/charter) provided from the weekly date of delivery for the 12 months forward, including updates on a weekly basis retrievable by FAMS in SSIM 7 file format via ftp.  

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number applicable to this request for proposal is HSCEAM-04-R-0012.  

In accordance with Clause 52.212-2, “Evaluation-Commerical Items,” offerors are advised that the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The factors listed below will be used to evaluate offers.

A.	Compatibility with FAMS Software – Contractor’s proposed service shall be compatible with existing FAMS software (i.e. SSIM format).  Contractors will be required to provide test data, if requested by FAMS, to allow FAMS to conduct the necessary testing to ensure compatibility.  Any offering found to be incompatible with FAMS software will be ineligible for award.

B.	Past Performance - Proposals shall provide a minimum of two (2) past performance references for contract services the offeror has provided which are similar in size and scope to this requirement.  Verified/current points of contact shall be provided for each reference to allow the Government to speak with references about the nature and quality of service provided.  When evaluating this factor, the Government will assign greater value to experience which is most directly related to the current requirement and for which customer references provide positive past performance reports which attest to their satisfaction with the offeror’s support.

C.	Completeness of Airline Schedule Coverage - Proposals shall detail the number and title of airlines included to illustrate the completeness of airline schedule coverage. This should include a list of the schedule data that would be provided, as documented in SSIM Chapters and Appendices, such as airline names, flight numbers, departure/arrival cities, dates/times of arrivals/departures, aircraft type, etc. In addition, this documentation shall include the number of flight sectors covered as well as the average number of schedule changes handled per month.  Also included in this section shall be a discussion of resources available for the collection, validation and management of flight schedules and related flight data input.  This discussion shall include the identification of any resources that will be exclusively dedicated to support of the Federal Air Marshall Service.  When evaluating this factor, the Government will assign greater value to proposals exhibiting the greatest breadth of airline schedule coverage as well as the availability of the greatest amount of resources to address the current FAMS requirements (to include exclusively dedicated resources). 

D.	Minimum performance requirements include: 

1.	24x7 operational IT support shall be provided which can be reached either via an Internet address or via a toll free telephone number.
2.	Verbal notification of airline reporting error shall occur within 2 hours of discovery (independent and proactively verify accuracy of schedules based on corporate expertise and knowledge and provide immediate personal notification upon recognition of possible error).  
3.	Proposals shall demonstrate the ability to deliver an ad hoc load should FAMS determine an additional mid cycle load is required.  Pricing for ad hoc loads shall be proposed on a per occurrence basis, separate from other pricing.  
4.	Proposals shall demonstrate the ability to provide a weekly report listing changes for each load (e.g. new airlines).  It is important that weekly reports reflect items such as new aircraft, new airlines, new city pair routes, etc.  
5.	Proposals shall specify a firm delivery date for each load and detail a notification procedure that will be followed if it is anticipated that delivery will be delayed for any reason.  When delays are experienced, FAMS shall be given priority when correcting any delivery delays.

When evaluating this factor, the Government will assign greater value to proposals which not only meet all minimum requirements, but which also exceed the Government’s requirements by offering additional benefits in a cost beneficial manner.


D. Pricing - Offerors shall provide pricing to cover a 12 month period.  Offerors shall assume the first week of service will be that of August 1, 2004.  Pricing shall be broken down by weekly costs based upon 52 weeks of service.  The weekly price shall be itemized to clearly show all components/services that are covered by the weekly price, to include the pricing for each of those components/services.  The itemized list provided shall clearly show how the total weekly price is derived.  Additionally, offerors shall provide a separate price for ad hoc loads which the Government may order on a per occurrence basis.  Finally, the offeror shall also provide pricing for two (2) additional 12-month option periods (2005-2006) in the format just described.

Evaluation factors in descending order of importance are compatibility with FAMS software, past performance, completeness of airline schedule coverage, satisfaction of minimum performance requirements, and price.  Technical evaluation factors (including past performance) when combined are more important than price.  Proposals shall not exceed 15 pages.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions concerning the Skateboard Camp Instructor combined synopsis/solicitation.


1. Is it correct that according to the SOW that it is planned to start the camps already on 14 June? We need to know a definite camp starting date, as we have to immediately reserve the personnel for such a short notice date.  
A7SPCY:  YES THE CAMPS START 14 JUN 04. 
2. It is mentioned that tutors should work IAW US youth program guidelines. These guide lines are not available to us, but we assume that they contain standard codes of ethics and behaviour. If there are guidelines outside of the normal moral standards, please let us know. 
A7SPCY:  CONTRACTORS MUST FOLLOW SAME MORAL AND ETHICAL GUIDELINES EXPECTED OF THE BASE YOUTH PROGRAM, NO SMOKING/TOBACCO PRODUCTS, NO ALCOHOL, NO DRUGS, MUST CONFORM TO SKATEPARK RULES BY WEARING EQUIPMENT, REPECT SELF, RESPECT OTHERS, RESPECT PROPERTY
3. The SOW states a ratio of 1:9 tutor to pupils. It also states that a class may not exceed 27 pupils, with 2 tutors per class. This constellation exceeds the ratio of 1:9. Is the ratio a guideline or is it necessary to furnish more tutors if the class exceeds 18 pupils?   
A7SPCY:  IT IS NECESSARY TO FURNISH MORE TUTORS, BASES ARE TOLD CLASSES SHOULD NOT EXCEED 27 SO PLAN FOR 27 PARTICIPANTS.  
4. The SOW states that the staff and volunteers should be trained also. Will this training be considered a separate class or will they be included in the pupil training class?   
ASPCY:  SEPARATE TRAINING/CLINIC FOR STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS 
5. We have german insurance and liabilities. Is there anything special we need to consider when teaching on a US Air Force Base?  We are not familiar with the insurance regulations on a US Army Base. 
ALL INFORMATION NEEDED WILL BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE CLAUSES OF THE PURCHASE ORDER
6. The SOW states that the contractor is responsible for his own food. Does that include beverages? The instructors and pupils require lots of water during the day. Do we need to supply our own water? 
A7SPCY:  WATER WILL BE SUPPLIED TO CAMP PARTICIPANTS AND INSTRUCTORS BY THE BASE YOUTH PROGRAMS
7. The SOW states that the instructors will be picked up from the various airports and taken to the place of performance. Is this correct? Is that applicable also if the airport is not in the near vicinity of the base? 
A7SPCY:  BASE YOUTH PROGRAM STAFF WILL PICK UP CONTRACTORS FROM THE AIRPORT AND GET THEM TO THE BASE, PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION IS NOT PROVIDED.
