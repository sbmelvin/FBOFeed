<a href="mailto:michael.velez5@us.army.mil">RDECOM Contracting Center - Edgewood (RDECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>The Joint Project Manager, Protection (JPM-P) seeks to establish a baseline of knowledge within industry relative to the technical maturity and availability of Chemical and Biological (CB) contaminant resistant lightweight/small volume motor blowers (and their associated power source) capable of interfacing with the JSAM-FW. <br><br>For the purposes of this questionnaire, lightweight/small volume motor blower refers to a blower device operated on battery power responsible for providing constant demist and cooling air to the JSAM-FW mask for the duration of the mission, as well as breathing air when the JSAM-FW mask is not connected to an oxygen source; furthermore, capable of minimizing torso bulk where the device will be worn by joint service members.  Lightweight system is approximately defined as 1250g and small volume is approximately defined as 500 cu cm.<br><br>The enclosed questionnaire is intended to assist the Government in defining the availability of existing lightweight motor blowers and their associated power source for potential inclusion into the JSAM-FW program.  <br><br>When making citation to formal reports, it is requested that respondents provide as much information about the cited report as possible.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so, identify proprietary components, interfaces and manufacturing techniques, and clearly mark restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted / non-proprietary information. Submission of proprietary data is at the discretion of the submitter. <br>Please complete all questions for which answers are known.  Response or lack of response will not be used to qualify or disqualify any respondent from future opportunities.  The information obtained will inform the Government of the availability and capability of existing lightweight motor-blowers (and their associated power source) which may be used to support future program plans.  This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government for follow-on-acquisition.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice, or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement or payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this Notice and Government use of such information.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  <br><br>If the requested information is not available, a response of "information not available" is preferred as opposed to no response/blank response.  <br>Response Limitations:  The government will review responses consisting of the completed questionnaire and no more than 10 supporting pages of information. Responses will be accepted for up to 30 days after release of this Notice.  Electronic submissions are encouraged and shall be sent to the following email address Mathew.w.lukacs@us.army.mil. The subject line of the email transmittal must be as follows: "Response to RFI WR11SR-11-MB-RFI".<br><br>The North American Industries Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 335312.
