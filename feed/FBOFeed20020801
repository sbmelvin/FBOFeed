<DESC>The Office of Public Health and Science, Office of Minority Health (OMH), through the Program Support Center plans to award a Nine month sole source simplified acquisition to the Center for Prevention and Health Services, Washington Business Group on Health, 50 F Street NW, Suite 600, Washington, DC 20001.  The Anticipated Date of award is August 22, 2002.  The Office of Minority Health (OMH) is launching a project to develop, produce, and disseminate a briefing paper (White Paper) on how employee can address workforce health disparities, including a section on the Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Service (CLAS) standards and their applicability to employers in purchasing health plans that are culturally and linguistically appropriate for their workforce.  This compendium is envisioned as a "Lessons Learned Tool Kit" for practitioners, support staff, and administrators in health care facilities in order to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services to diverse populations.   The OMH's CLAS will guide the framework of this project in developing the "Lessons Learned Tool Kit." The contractor shall complete the following: Task I: Complete at least nine (9) case studies.  These studies will focus on different aspects or categories of programs reflecting CLAS in public hospital and health system settings.  The studies will be structured in order to provide practical guidance on how to improve cultural competence and will represent NAPH facilities serving both single and diverse targeted populations.  The elements of each case study will include, but not be limited to, a program description; focus populations; an analysis of workforce demographics; description of program implementation; the use of community resources, if appropriate; and the pertinent printed and website-based materials. Task II Conduct a Focus Group: The study team will conduct a focus group of public hospital chief executives during NAPH?s annual conference, which will provide an opportunity to meet with several of the Nation's most innovative and committed leaders in hospital management. The group will convene around the issue of cultural competence in health care - a topic that is of enormous interest to NAPH members at institutions across the country.  The principal objectives of conducting this focus group shall be: 1) to research and analyze the key leadership components needed to plan, develop, and sustain an environment that reflects a belief that cultural competence is part of the core mission of the organization and not just an "add-on" program or activity; 2) to review and test the findings and lessons learned during the case study development phase of this project; and 3) to provide practical results and guidelines on how cultural competence works on a daily basis and how the community is informed and involved. Task III Document Lessons Learned: This important part of the project shall presented in a practical and adaptable fashion those crosscutting findings from "Models that Work" that provide value to a variety of settings and that can be applied to particular populations and situations.  It is envisioned that Lessons Learned Tool Kit shall be a handbook or practical manual for providers for use in planning, implementing, and sustaining a culturally competent health care delivery operation that reflects a genuine intent to meet CLAS.  The project team shall give particular attention to the development of creative and compelling formats utilizing printed media and contemporary computer and website-based technology. Task IV. Develop Recommendations for Dissemination of Findings and Executive Summary Report: In an effort to advance the field by offering additional avenues for dissemination of lessons learned, NAPH shall prepare a memorandum to OMH recommending non-traditional print, website-based, and video media that would require additional resources to develop and that are beyond the current scope of this project.  An executive summary report shall also be developed for the project, outlining various methodologies and processes used to complete the project including recommendations for future work in the area.  The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within seven (7) days after the date of publication of this notice .  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation is available.

The project has a significant public awareness, environmental constraints, and involves political organizations.   The permitted project conceptual plan includes constructing a full tidal area, muted tidal areas, and seasonal wetlands areas.  The primary emphasis of the project is the restoration of fish and wildlife habitat.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service will pre-qualify offerors in three functional fields that are capable of providing qualified personnel to perform the jobs (13 labor categories) described in the Statement of Work.  Pre-qualification is a process where a supplier?s ability to meet specific Postal Service requirements is evaluated.  After a review of the capability statements have been completed, those deemed most qualified (pre-Qualified) to perform the work will be awarded ordering agreements.  All qualified suppliers may not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team determines that a smaller group will provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others thereby precluding contract opportunities for the less qualified.  The USPS decision to pre-qualify suppliers is a business decision of the Contracting Officer. Pre-qualification does not constitute an award of the work nor a promise of any work in the future.  THE DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF PREQUALIFICATION STATEMENTS IS JUNE 3, 2002.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for provide an Aura instrument simulator capability to process payload specific commands and generate telemetry data for the Aura instruments.  This simulator shall be able to general Aura Instrument telemetry in a format consistent with the Government Furnished Information (GFI) mission database.  Each telemetry pneumonic which has a default value shall be set to that value.  The interface shall support the 1553 formats for passing telemetry and command packets to and from the ISC via the ISIM.  The Aura instrument simulator interface code shall collect power, timing, and status data from the ISIM system and accurately reflect this information in the correct telemetry pneumonic and packets.  One the Auro instrument simulator has been accepted by the IVVF team, a version of the Auro instrument simulator shal be installed into the ETFS facility. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Vega IT, Inc. Alexandria, VA.  The simulator needs to have the existing Aqua PSIM (that is alreday part of the IVVF) upgraded so that it will also perform as an Aura instrument simulator.  Vega IT was the developer of the Aqua PSIM.  Vega IT is the contractor for the SIMSAT Simulation Kernel which was used to support the Aqua Payment Simulator (PSIM).  If another vendor was used, then they would use a different Simulation Kernel, or they would have to learn to use the SIMSAT Simulation Kernel.  These options would make the Aqua and Aura PSIMs incompatible (which would drive up the cost of using and maintaining th PSIMs); increase the time for developing the Arua PSIM (which would impat the FSW test and development schedule); increase the likelihood of introducing mission-threatening errors into the PSIM because of potential simulation kernel incompatibilities or lack of knowledge of the SIMSAT simulation kernel; and significantly drive up development costs because a different vendor would need to become familiar with the IVVF and the Aque PSIM implementation.  Due to this, Vega IT has the unique knowledge regarding the use of the SIMSAT SW in developing an Aura Instrument simulator based on their effort on the Aqua PSIM.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 19, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to General Atomics (GA) to procure the necessary design information required to fabricate an inductively heated vertical tube furnace and to procure specialized unique components required for furnace assembly. Pursuant to FAR 13.106, this requirement is considered to be reasonably available from only one source, GA, and competition is impractical for the following reasons: (1) GA designed and fabricated an inductively heated vertical tube furnace, which has unique capabilities and is the only known furnace of its type in existence.  GA considers the design for this furnace to be proprietary; however, it is willing to provide the design information and specialized assembly components to MSFC to fabricate a duplicate furnace of its own.  There is no known source other the GA, which can provide the required design information and specialized components.   (2) There are no other known furnaces or furnace designs that will satisfy MSFC's requirements.  Alternative furnace system designs have been considered but are not practical or economical. MSFC will utilize the furnace as part of a very high temperature coating and joining process system to fabricate refractory ceramic coatings on high-temperature carbon-carbon and ceramic matrix composites.  The system will enable coatings to be fabricated at temperatures up to 2,550C {4,622F}, with vacuum operation up to approximately 2,700C {4,892F}.  It will be capable of reaching temperatures of 2,550C in approximately 12 minutes.   The specialized unique components required for furnace assembly include water-cooled quartz tube assemblies, carbon insulation and support components, graphite susceptors, and related fixtures, valves, manifolds, etc. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 7, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG)/International Broadcasting Bureau  (BBG/IBB) has a requirement to expand its existing Integrated Digital Audio Production System (IDAPS) to add production of video, still image and web media components.  The IDAPS system is the prime infrastructure that the Voice of America (VOA) broadcasters utilize to produce, store, and retrieve their broadcasting work products.  BBG/IBB has invested substantial resources in this state-of-the art broadcasting system and in accordance with FAR Part 15, we intend to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with TGS Inc, 4500 Southgate Place, Chantilly, VA  20151. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition applicable to this procurement is stated in FAR 6.302-1, 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) which permits other than full and open competition when only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.

<DESC>The US Army, TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, intends to solicit under Other Than Full and Open Competition to restrict to US and Canada IAW 10 USC  2304(c)(3) and FAR 6.302-3(b)(i)(v) for a new 25mm training round to replace  the M910 25mm training round.  This new training round will emulate service  Cartridges, 25mm, Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer  (APFSD-T), M919 and the Cartridge, 25mm, APDS-T M791.  The requirement consists  of System Development and Demonstration (SDD) and the first 1-3 years of  production for the cartridge, 25mm, Target Practice with Tracer (TPDS-T),  M910E1.  This new training round will be fired from the 25mm M242 Autogun on  the M2/ M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle.  The M910E1 will be required to match the  trajectory of the M919 to within 1 mil and 0.5 seconds out to a range of 2500  meters. The M910E1 will be required to match the trajectory of the M791 to  within 1 mil and 0.5 seconds out to a range of 2000 meters. The M910E1 will  have a maximum range requirement of 8000 meters.  One contract will be awarded  for the SDD phase. Contract award is anticipated in early FY03.  At the end of  the SDD phase the contractor will deliver a qualification sample necessary to  demonstrate the safety and performance characteristics of the M910E1. Elapsed  time from SDD contract award to completion of qualification will be 21 months.   TC-LRP is planned for the fourth quarter FY04. The contract may contain  production options, which could be exercised if the M910E1 achieves Type  Classification-Standard and funding becomes available.  It is anticipated that  a second source will be solicited upon successful achievement of TC-LRP to  support a dual source procurement strategy for follow-on production.  The  Government intends to issue a draft solicitation, which will include the  Statement of Objectives (SOO) and Uniform Contract Format Sections L and M  (Offeror Submittal Information and Government Evaluation Procedures).  The  purpose of the draft solicitation is to solicit comments from industry, which  will then result in a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) posted on this  website.  Potential offerors are invited to download and review the documents,  and submit comments via e-mail for Government consideration.  Comments and  other correspondence may be submitted via e-mail to the Contract Specialist at  the address cited above.  Care should be taken to ensure timely submission of  comments.  Firms who intend to submit prime contract proposals may request  their name and contact information to be posted to the website for the  convenience of potential subcontractors.  Send e-mail request to Contract  Specialist at address above.  The response date above reflects the time for the  draft solicitation as well as the formal RFP.  Electronic Commerce  Considerations include the intent, insofar as practicable, of conducting this  acquisition electronically, with minimum actual paper.  However, in the event  paper submissions are requested or become unavoidable, submit to:  Commander,  US Army TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, AMSTA-AQ- APF, Bldg. 9, ATTN: Geoffrey Cramer, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.

<DESC>The following announcement is made pursuant to section 3.2.1.2.1 (Market Analysis) of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The FAA intends to acquire up to 30 operational Stand-Alone Tower Display Systems (SATDS) between Fiscal Year 2003 to Fiscal Year 2005.  The FAA intends that the awardee(s) will be responsible for the installation, logistics support, training, and system acceptance, operational test and associated support.  The SATDS interim solution deployment and site Air Traffic Control operational acceptance must be accomplished within 6 months of contract award/authorization. <P> The FAA intends to make maximum use of pre-existing: test, training, maintenance, and logistics support systems in order to expedite delivery of the SATDS and minimize life cycle costs.  The SATDS is an interim solution that is intended for use in pre-existing Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs) not associated with a Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility.  These ATCTs do not currently receive automation data from a TRACON.  These ATCTs generally have long range Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR) coverage as opposed to short range Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) coverage.  However, the SATDS must provide the capability to receive and display aircraft position data to the ATCT controller from ARSR, ASR, or both systems.  The SATDS, as an interim solution, is to be eventually replaced by the Standard Terminal Automation System (STARS) Tower Display Workstation (TDW).  STARS TDWs will be interconnected to the TRACON automation system.  <P> Functional requirements for the SATDS include, but are not limited to the following:  Conflict Alert (CA) safety functions; Mode C Intruder (MCI) safety functions; Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) safety functions; primary and secondary radar(s) target identification; alphanumeric capabilities (data blocks, lists); and weather information services. <P> Due to the expedited schedule for this procurement, this offering is limited to vendors with pre-existing, fielded, FAA Certified, United States of America National Airspace System (NAS) real-time terminal air traffic control automation systems.  To the FAA's knowledge, there are only two (2) systems that meet the above, Lockheed Martin Corporation's ARTS-IE and Raytheon Corporation's STARS-LITE.  If you disagree, please provide evidence within 2 weeks of the opening date for this announcement of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing system(s) that meet the above requirements. The FAA will evaluate your response accordingly. <P> Questions and requests for additional information may be directed to Mr. Lou Hammond by e-mail at lou.hammond@faa.gov, or by telephone at 202/264-3538. <P> NOTE:   ARTS-IE stands for Automated Radar Terminal System - Version IE; STARS-LITE stands for Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System Local Integrated Tower Equipment <P>

<DESC>The work under this procurement consists of the contractor providing all labor, material, equipment, transportation, administration, and supervision to conduct surveys of threatened, endangered, or rare plants at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Miramar, California.  Work may include surveying approximately 7,000 acres for 17 rare plants that potentially occur on MCAS Miramar, collecting and mounting plant species, mapping the location and extent of each plant species, and drafting various reports as may be required.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541620.  This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis.  The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract.  Firms responding to this solicitation must show experience consistent with the following evaluation factors:  (1) past performance information; (2) technical experience/key personnel qualifications/requirements; (2A) Bachelor?s degree with an emphasis in botany, ecology, or a related science; (2B) three years of local experience in identifying and surveying for rare plants within The Jepson Manual?s floristic province entitled ?Southwestern California, South Coast (SW SCo);? (2C) a familiarity with rare plants found within coastal sage scrub, chaparral, riparian, vernal pools, and oak woodland flora and ecology, autecology, and soils experience); (3) price.  When the proposal is evaluated, Factors 1 and 2 are equal in importance.  Within Factor 2, Subfactor 2B is considered more important than Subfactors 2A and 2C.  Notwithstanding the relative importance of Subfactors, the influence of the Subfactors will depend in large measure upon the nature and range of actual variation in differences among the proposals received.  In general, the greater the range of quality of the proposals received for any technical Subfactor, the more influential that Subfactor will be.  [For example, if the difference between the best and worst proposals on Subfactor 2A is great, while the difference between the best and worst proposals on Subfactor 2C is small, then Subfactor 2A will be more influential than Subfactor 2C when the Government determines which offer represents the best value.]  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1 and 2 combined are approximately equal in importance to Factor 3.  The source selection process will identify whether offerors meet the evaluation criteria specified, and select the responsive, responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  The award will consist of a base year and four one-year option periods.  The minimum guarantee for the contract is $2,000.00.  Work will be ordered on individual Task Orders placed against the contract.  The availability of the solicitation will be limited to electronic media; the solicitation will be available for viewing and downloading, free of charge, via the electronic solicitation website:  http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  The official planholder?s list will be maintained on, and may be printed from, the website.  All prospective offerors and planrooms are required to register as planholders on the website.  Notification of any updates or amendments to the solicitation will be posted on the website only.  IT IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OFFEROR TO CONTINUALLY VIEW THE WEBSITE FOR CHANGES.  The solicitation will be made available approximately August 6, 2002.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiation on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5- Test Program for Certain Commercial Items,  with Syracuse Research Corporation (SRC) for a continuation of existing services to build and update the Environmental Fate and Exposure Category of chemical records contained in the NLM Hazardous Substance Data Bank (HSDB).  The records contained in the HSDB must be continually augmented with current environmental fate and exposure data and information.  The majority of the data and information sources have been derived from original journal reference and unpublished but scientifically credible and documented test results.  SRC will be required to extract from data files and source material information pertinent to environmental fate and exposure into a format compatible with the HSDB.  SCR will provide chemical/physical and health effects information for ChemIDplus physics and TOXLINE Databases.  SRC has complied, organized and evaluated environmental fate information on an extensive number in industrial organic chemicals that are of high priority in HSDB, ChemIDplus, and TOXLINE Databases.  They also developed four environmental fate databases, which contain chemical/physical information pertinent to fate, transport, and degradation of 16,000 chemicals in the environment.   The HSDB contains over 4,500 chemical records covering all the regulated substances under the Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, and the Labor Department.  The health and environmental effects in the files have been kept current as new information is published or generated by industry in compliance with the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

Health professionals in the public and private sector use the databases as a source of current data when assessing the impact of hazardous chemical sites, and when obtaining information on the effect of chemicals on health.  SRC holds the copyright to the four databases and therefore possesses the rights to the publication or distribution of the information contained within them.  Based on their twenty years of knowledge, expertise and scientific staff, SRC has provided their services to NLM for over 15 years and is the only known source to provide this service.  The period of performance will be for one year with options for four successive one-year periods.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced services as specified above.  Responses must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information.  NLM Synopsis No. NLM 02-178/KDR.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Karen D. Riggs, Contracting Officer, NLM on (301) 496-6546 or by email to kr33v@nih.gov; or to Uyen H.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for code modifications to the GENOA computer program.  The modifications will allow the GENOA program to determine wrinkling patterns and out of plane displacements of membrane structures, such as solar sails.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the code modification from Alpha Star Corporation as the only responsible source who will meet agency requirements.  The GENOA computer program is the only existing program identified by LaRC that can be modified with both relative ease and a reasonable probability of success to accurately determine the wrinkling patterns and wrinkling displacements for the design of solar sails.  Alpha Star Corporation is the developer and exclusive supplier of GENOA and therefore the only source that can modify the codes within the program. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 05 August 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

As a minimum, each task order issued for the pumping of toilets on the White Mountain District, will guarantee one of the following:

a)	Two vaults
b)	Two pits
c)	One portable toilet   

Pumping Procedures when an Outside Manhole is Available : Portable toilets shall be completely emptied. All portable chemical toilets shall be recharged by the contractor adding 12 to 14 gallons of water and chemical to each unit immediately after pumping. Large vaults and pits are to be emptied to a point not less than 6 inches from the bottom.  The compacting of waste material in the bottom of the vault by tamping will not be allowed.

As long as the outside pump out access is in excess of 20 inches in diameter (or 20 inches square) the contractor shall not be allowed to remove the contents through the toilet riser.

Using a pressure washer system, wash down the interior walls of the vault before the clinging debris has a chance to dry. If at this time there is a heavy concentration of solids on the bottom of the vault, use the pressure system to break&#64979;up and dilute the solids and then pump this diluted waste down again to the 4&#64979;5 inch level. Compacting the waste in the bottom of the vault to obtain the 4&#64979;5 inch level will not be allowed.

The flat-bottomed vault shall be recharged with enough water to bring the depth of water up to 10 inches. Hot Creek shall be recharged to 20 inches. For sloped vaults, pump the waste down (at the deep end) to where the hose begins to suck air. Remove any remaining debris and then go inside the building with the pressure system and wash the remaining waste down the sloped bottom. Pump out the remaining waste until the suction hose begins to suck too much air to make further pumping practical. Recharge the vault with clean fresh water so there is 10 inches of water covering the bottom under the toilet riser.

Clean up and disinfect all contaminated areas resulting from the pumping process. Either sweep or wash all waste that is deposited on the concrete surrounding the manhole cover back into the vault if possible. Avoid getting waste on the adjacent gravel or dirt.

Pumping Through the Toilet Riser when there is no Outside Manhole:Remove the debris and pump accordance with 9.3.  Extra care shall be taken to prevent waste spillage onto the interior wall and floor surfaces. The toilet paper dispenser and toilet riser shall be protected from damage and contamination. During the final cleanup, the interior wall and floor surfaces contaminated by waste shall be thoroughly disinfected. Thoroughly disinfect both inside and outside of the toilet riser. The riser, door handles and knobs shall be dry before the contractor leaves.

Each unit shall be available for immediate use after the pumping and final cleanup. The contractor shall not leave any toilet location until final cleanup is complete.

All chemical toilets in the North Zone Recreation Area are owned by the USFS.  See Item 01-I.  In addition to pumping any chemical (portable) toilet shall be re-charged as per normal industry standards.

The chemical (portable) toilets in the South Zone Recreation Area are owned by the previous contractor.  The successor contractor shall, if awarded the pumping of the chemical (portable) toilets, provide replacement toilets.  See Items 02 I. and 02 L.  In addition to pumping any chemical (portable) toilet shall be re-charged as per normal industry standards.  

All non-portable chemical toilets will be re-charged by the USFS.

Drafting of water:Contractor may draft fresh water (for pressure washing, recharge and final cleanup) from lakes, ponds, and streams under the following conditions:

a.	Drafting shall be accomplished where it least interferes with public use of the facility and is least visible by the public.

b.	No waste shall be introduced into any body of water.

c.	The Contracting Officer shall approve all sites used for drafting of water.

Offsite Disposal of Sewage and Debris: The contractor shall be responsible for making disposal arrangements, including disposal of all effluent, debris, and trash, and shall be responsible for payment of all fees. Disposal shall conform to all Federal, State and local laws and ordinances. The Contracting Officer (CO) shall approve all disposal sites before pumping begins.

Conduct of Personnel: The Contractor and employees shall make every reasonable effort to prevent interference with the normal use and occupancy of recreation areas while engaged in the performance of the contract. Due to the nature of the contract, the Contractor and employees shall keep themselves and equipment presentable at all times. The Contracting Officer  (CO) may, in writing, require the Contractor to remove from the work site any employee the CO deems incompetent, careless, discourteous to the public, or is otherwise objectionable, or for theft, possession and/or removal of materials, supplies, equipment, or any Government owned property.

Resource Damage:Any damage or defacement that occurs to government property or land resources as a result of the Contractors operations shall be repaired, at the contractor's expense, to its original condition.

...........PART 7-3 CONTRACTOR-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT  
The contractor's tank must have a California Department of Transportation certification. The truck must be equipped with the type of a back&#64979;up brake system for steep grades and high elevations up to 11,000 feet. Fifty feet of suction hose will be required to pump toilets that are some distance from a service road. Tank truck must be able to draft sewage at extremely high elevations.

The contractor shall furnish all toilet pumping equipment, tank truck (a truck that can reverse the suction process and create a pressure force is preferred so that the inevitable clogged lines can be more easily cleaned), water truck, tools, approved disinfectant, and other equipment and supplies necessary to perform work in accordance with these specifications. A four-inch minimum suction hose and attachment couplings shall be utilized to accomplish all pumping requirements. The length of hose must be long enough to accomplish the required pumping.

A pressure washing is required to wash the sides and end walls of the vault after pumping and may be necessary to dilute solidified waste in the bottom of a flat bottomed vault and to wash the last portion of waste down a sloped bottomed vault.

Water drafting equipment (if necessary to get water from a lake, pond, or stream) shall consist of pumps, tanks, hoses, etc. and shall be completely separate from toilet waste pumping and hauling equipment.

All disinfecting solutions shall be approved by the Contracting Officer.
All equipment shall be in full accordance with any local and State regulations.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Dr. Brent Boyack to complete an ongoing effort started previously at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  This effort involves employing the Phenomena Identification and Ranking Tables (PIRT) process to obtain a draft pre-PIRT and final PIRT reports on TRISO coated fuel particles for gas-cooled reactors.  Dr. Boyack successfully facilitated and conducted the first pre-PIRT meeting as part of the NRC project.  He is uniquely qualified to complete this work because he possesses the expertise on employing the PIRT process.  In 1987, he led the pioneering PIRT effort as part of the Code Scaling, Applicability and Uncertainty (CSAU) project.  Since then he has continued to be involved in the PIRT efforts.  The PIRT process is unique to NRC and no one, other than Dr. Boyack, possesses the expertise to perform this task.  The PIRT process requires facilitation of continuous interaction between expert participants in order to reach a common understanding and identification of the phenomena, process and issue using the standards, such as success criteria, established for that particular project.  Common understanding and identification of the phenomena are very important since the ranking of importance depend on this understanding.  Quality of results strongly depend on the expertise of the facilitator who leads the process.  The second task part of this proposed purchase order is for development of research recommendations for the TRAC-M code to calculate system transients in CANDU reactors.  Dr. Boyack has extensive experience both on the TRAC-M code and CANDU reactors.  He has been the Principal Investigator directing the TRAC-M code development effort at LANL for many years and he has also been the Principal Investigator on a project concerning the thermal hydraulic aspects of CANDU reactors. Dr. Boyack is uniquely qualified also for this part of the work as evidenced by his CANDU and TRAC-M activities over the past 10 years. The period of performance for this effort is estimated to be 7 months. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 13. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all capability statements received by August 15, 2002 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel:  703-875-4357, Fax:  703-875-4009, E-mail:  ekunene@tda.gov  :  DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place  :  Mr. Nicolae Franculescu, Vice-Mayor, Municipality of Buzau, Str. Unirii nr. 163, Buzau, Romania, Phone: 40-238-710-204, Fax: 40-238-445-030  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to focus on the technical and financial aspects of modernizing and repowering the district heating system in the Romanian city of Buzau to include a combined heat and power plant.

The Ministry of Industry and Resources and the Ministry of Public Administration of Romania have recently decided to transfer responsibility for developing local energy system policies to the municipalities.  The District Heating systems in most municipalities are either CHP (Combined Heat and Power) or HOB (Heat Only) plants. These plants are generally in poor condition due to lack of maintenance and investment over the years. Therefore, the municipalities are looking for investors willing to provide funds for rehabilitation, in return for guaranteed revenues from heat and electricity sales.  The Buzau municipal plant appears likely to attract an investor.

The plant is equipped with 2*116 MWt hot water boilers, which provide heat to the Buzau municipality and its residents.  The heat transport and distribution part of the system has been thoroughly modernized with EBRD funding.  Its system losses are minimal, efficiency is much higher, and rates can be maintained at sufficiently low levels that customers are willing and able to pay their bills. The collection rate in this municipality is at the 85% level. Buzau now needs to transform the HOB plant into a CHP plant with a new power component of about a 30 MW gas turbine and a hot water recovering boiler.  This can be procured on a turnkey basis from a US vendor, and installed and connected to the DH system and electrical grid.  Buzau would consider a Built-Operate-Transfer (BOT) scheme for this project. 

The Buzau City Municipality estimates that repowering the existing plant with combined heat and power capabilities would improve the heat situation, and would recover significant amounts of the project cost from the sales of electricity within the municipality and surplus sales to the national grid.            

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $293,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, September 4, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

NOTE: This procurement is open ONLY to LAW FIRMS or SOLO practitioners of LAW licensed to practice law in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.  As a result of P.L. 104-134, which amended the Federal Debt Recovery Act, the Department of Justice intends to award contracts to private practitioners of law for debt collection services on behalf of the United States in the following federal judicial district:  Northern District of New York (Syracuse).  The contractors will be required to pursue debt collection activities which parallel existing industry procedures that have proven to be effective and efficient; to interact with government representatives at defined stages of the collection process (i.e., settlement, compromise, etc.); to input relevant case data in a computer base maintained by the government.  Payment will be made by a combination of contingency fees and firm, fixed prices.  Law firms or solo practitioners who respond to this solicitation MUST be regularly engaged in the private practice of LAW within the Northern Federal Judicial District of New York.

NOTE: The Act provides that the Department may contract ONLY with law firms or solo practitioners of law since contractors must represent the United States in court.  The government anticipates awarding up to four contracts (or more or less at the discretion of the government).  The period of performance for each contract will be one base year plus up to six optional years.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Dr. Douglas Nowacek of Mote Marine Laboratory to assess risk factors involved in collisions between ships and North Atlantic right whales.   The agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction, and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery, and safeguard the quality of their habitat.  The North Atlantic right whale is among the most critically endangered of any whale population in the world, with approximately 300 animals remaining.   The proposed contract is intended to provide support for the analyses of detailed and extensive data, most of which have already been collected, which have the potential to provide unique insights into the behavior of North Atlantic right whales in the presence of vessels and therefore, in designing conservation management strategies related to ship strike mitigation.  The main objectives of the project are as follows: to complete field studies begun under a previous NOAA contract; to analyze whales' reactions to all experimental and opportunistic vessel approaches as well as to all controlled sound exposures; to prepare new data for publication in peer reviewed journals; and to participate in meetings/working groups where the data will be useful, notably in formulating policy with regard to right whales and ship strikes.   Dr. Douglas Nowacek is uniquely qualified to conduct this project due to his experience in marine mammal bioacoustics and behavior combined with his knowledge of the multi-sensor digital acoustic tag, its application, and data products.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.   Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of  their capability to respond to the requirement by August 9, 2002.  Written requests may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.   The solicitation document will be issued on or about August 9, 2002.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Request for Information
for a Map-Based Web Solution
Designed to Locate GSA Facilities
(GSA Building Locator Project)


1.0	SUBJECT

Request for Information (RFI) for a technical solution to help manage GSA?s real estate inventory by identifying building locations and related resources using mapping and web-based technology.  This project is designated the GSA Building Locator Project.  Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on August 5, 2002.  See section 9.0 for further information.

2.0	DESCRIPTION

The GSA, Public Buildings Service (PBS) Chief Information Officer (CIO), Computer Integrated Facilities Management (CIFM) Division is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of a map-based, web solution that will locate GSA facilities as well as related resources.

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

2.1	Conceptual technical architecture alternatives; which platforms used.

2.2	Technical feasibility alternatives assessments.

2.3	Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives.

2.4	Information about existing solutions that could support the GSA Building Locator Project, minimizing the need for special construction and associated costs and time delays.

2.5	Schedule estimates

2.6	Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing a map-based, web solution for locating GSA facilities.

2.7	Can the software perform address matching?  There are around 8,000 addresses to be mapped and located on a map.

2.8	Each address has between 25 to 100 attributes associated with them.  Can the software perform Boolean queries, buffer queries, and distance calculations?

2.9	Is the data set accurate?  When an address is mapped, does the symbol, marking the position, appear on the correct side of the street?  Does the address matching algorithm use geocodes or address ranges?

2.10	Available training, if required?how long, how much is necessary, and prerequisites?

2.11	Is solution documentation thorough and complete?

3.0	REQUIREMENTS

3.1	Ability to map GSA building locations by address (approximately 8,000 locations), using street addresses, and marking the location of the building with a symbol on the map as accurately as possible.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources for supplying the U.S. Army with a low hydrolyzed Vinyl Alcohol Acetate Resin (VAAR) for use in munitions.  Respondents should be currently capable of manufacturing VAAR, designated as BAKELITE Resin MA-28-18 and defined by Mil-V- 50433.  VAAR was last produced by Union Carbide (UC) in the mid-1990s.   VAAR produced by UC and meeting Mil-V-50433 is characterized in the table below: Material  Color    %by     % by weight  Brookfield  DSC Thermal  Molecular           (cpu)    weight  Resin Solids Viscosity   Stability    Weight(Mn/Mw)           Cobalt  Dry Resin  MIL-V-      (cps)      ASTM D-3418  GPC (Gel            Platinum Basis     50433-4.3.3 per ASTM                Permetion           Method   Alcohol               D-2196                  Chromatography)           per MIL- Content           V-       per MIL-           50433-   V-50433-           4.3.1    4.3.2 Type 1    300 max.  16-19      26-29     400-800     On Set      Mn 58600 VAARs                                    (at 20      101degrees  Mw 151800                                          DegreesC)   C Peak at                                                         104Degrees C It is the U.S. Armys desire to obtain VAAR produced using the UC manufacturing process with the same starting materials and solvents, and the VAAR produced by this process having essentially the same polymer structure and physical and  chemical properties.  However, if the if a modified process to achieve the  characteristics identified in the above table, then the process variants shall be clearly identified in the respondents submission to this market Survey.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife intends to negotiate under sole source with Spring Rivers Ecological Sciences/Mary J. Ellis, Cassel, California, to accomplish a study to assess the use of aquatic barriers to prevent the continued dispersal and invasion of the non-native signal crayfish in the range of the Shasta Crayfish.  Tasks:  Support the ongoing design and testing of barriersto prevent non-native crayfish from reaching Shasta crayfish populations within the next one to five years.  Upon successful development of the barriers, additional funding will need to be provided for the installation of the barriers.   This is expected to be a multi-year project for approximately five years.  The scope of this work ultimately aims to protect the few remaining allopatric Shasta crayfish populations from the most serious threat to this species:  the invasion of the non-native signal crayfish.  Implementation of the proposed action is critical to achieve the downlisting criteria in the Shasta crayfish recovery plan and prevent the species from declining irreversibly.  Upon completion of the basic task, several other recovery tasks await the results of the barrier study, including the installation of barriers to protect the allopatric Shasta crayfish populations in upper Fall River and Rising River.  The awarded contractor will provide semi-annual and annual reports. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to the University of Maryland to collect samples from retail meats originating from organic or natural farms and determine antimicrobial-susceptibility profiles for three strains of bacteria associated with foodborne disease, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Enterococcus.  The work to be performed includes obtaining identified retail organic meat samples, examining the samples for the presence of Enterococcus, Campylobacter, and Salmonella, confirming their identity using biochemical tests, and processing these samples to permit freezer storage of multiple isolates from each sample for further analyses.  These analyses include examining the bacterial isolates for their virulence potential by the identification of their virulence genes, determining comprehensive antibiograms of these isolates using a commercially available panel of 17 antibiotics, and performing DNA fingerprinting to determine the clonality of these isolates.  Other parties interested in and capable of performing this shall work shall submit their capability statement on or before August 16, 2002.  These statements must show that the proposed principal investigator is an expert in the detection of pathogens in food products and in food microbiology. Offerors must also demonstrate experience working with Salmonella, Campylobacter, Enterococcus, and other foodborne bacterial pathogens, collecting surveillance data on antimicrobial-resistant bacteria isolated from retail meats and/or retail organic meats, and expertise in mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and resistance gene transfer.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) China Lake, CA is seeking information on the manufacturers of flake aluminum powders and manufacturers of pyrotechnic materials for military applications.  The Ordnance Evaluation Branch, Code 478400D, of NAWCWD, has been tasked to evaluate the costs associated with the purchasing and subsequent processing of large quantities of flake powders for military applications.  Specifically, NAWCWD is interested in leafing grade aluminum flake powders on the order of 10-20 micron average particle size and the associated cost when purchasing quantities of several thousand pounds.  Additionally, NAWCWD is investigating the availability and costs of select fluorocarbon polymers, as well as, the procedures and associated costs for their coating onto the flake powders resulting in a molding powder for consolidation into billets of material.  Current methods employed by the pyrotechnics and related manufactures in industry for such processing of large quantities of energetic materials are sought.  Methods and estimated costs for the final consolidation into billets of various shapes, sizes and density of the processed powders are also of critical interest in the study.  Contractors should appropriately mark any data that is proprietary or has restricted data rights.  All submittals must be unclassified, however, classified data may be referenced to enable a data request to be submitted.   Interested parties shall provide their information to Commander (Code 210000D), NAWCWD (Attn.: Jerry Manley), 1 Administration Circle, China Lake, CA 93555-6100 no later than COB 21 August 2002.  Additional information may be obtained through the technical point of contact at NAWCWD, Phil Dixon,(760) 939-7125. This Sources Sought is for information and not a formal request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government in an award of any contract.

NIST DOCKET NUMBER:  01-022PA

Title:  	Miniature Frequency Standard Based On All-Optical Excitation And A Micromachined Containment Vessel

Description:  	A design for a microwave frequency standard has been developed which allows for miniaturization down to length scales of order one micron.  The frequency standard is based on all-optical excitation techniques such as coherent population trapping (CPT) and stimulated Raman scattering.  It comprises a modulated semiconductor laser that illuminates a collection of quantum absorbers contained in a micro-machined cell.  In one manifestation, a photodetector located above the cell measures the optical power transmitted through the quantum absorbers, which changes when the laser modulation frequency corresponds to the absorber's transition frequency.  This change in transmitted power can be used to stabilize an external oscillator.  In another manifestation, a high-speed photodetector above the cell can detect the original laser field beating with a second field originating in the cell through the process of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS).  This beat frequency can in principle be very stable as it is referenced directly to the atomic transition.

Title:  	The Tripod Manipulator

Description:  	The Tripod Manipulator is a joystick controlled manipulator capable of maneuvering a wide-range of payloads throughout a wide-range of work volumes.  This manipulator is notable for its extremely high payload-to-weight ratio as compared to existing commercial manipulators and for its high work volume-to-size ratio.  This invention is available for use without a license.

NIST DOCKET NUMBER:  02-006PA

Title:	Fast Transient Microscale Heating For Chemical And Biochemical Detection

Description:	A method is described for detection of surfactants, and surface active water-soluble polymers and biopolymers in solutions based on temperature measurements of a rapidly heated thin metallic film that is immersed in the liquid.  The metallic film, approximately 100-200 micrometers in length by tens of micrometers in width, is heated by application of a voltage pulse of approximately 10 microseconds or less.  The electrical resistance of the thin film is measured during application of the voltage pulse.  A temperature versus time transient of the heating of the thin film in the liquid is generated from prior calibration of the resistance-temperature characteristics of the film.  The presence of surfactants or biopolymers is detected from changes in the heating transient relative to the transient generated in the pure liquid or solvent.  Transients exhibit a monotonically increasing heater temperature followed by an inflection point that signals bubble nucleation on the surface from solution boiling.  At longer time oscillations are sometimes observed that presumably result from a cyclic growth/collapse nucleate boiling process.  The presence of surface-active agents alters the surface tension of the solutions or surface wettability of the heaters which in turn is manifested by changes in the heating transients.  The concentration of surface-active agents can be correlated with changes in the integrated temperature of the heating transient (inversely related to the heat transfer to the liquid), changes in the nucleation temperature, or changes in the oscillatory behavior.

<SUBJECT>--This is a Special Notice Regarding the Organizational Conflict of Interest Issue regarding the D/SIDDOMS Solicitation DASW01-02-R-0031
<DESC>NA Proposed Organizational Conflict of Interest clause for D/SIDDOMS 3: THE D/SIDDOMS 3 RFP is being issued as a full and open competition under which all contractors eligible for federal contracts are encouraged to participate.  The intent of this conflict of interest clause is to prevent any actual or apparent organizational  conflict of interest with TMA.//   The D/SIDDOMS 3 RFP is being issued to obtain Program Development / Execution Support.  It restricts Contractor participation in program activities to one of two, mutually exclusive categories:  Program Management Contractor Support and Program Development / Execution Support.  Contractors may submit offers in either of these categories; however, no contractor or key contractor personnel who have performed work in the Program Management category will be eligible to perform in the D/SIDDOMS 3 Program Developm ent category for a minimum of two (2) years after the conclusion of performance in the Program Management category, such ineligibility to include performing as a prime contractor, subcontractor or consultant.  Because of the ongoing nature of the D/SIDDOMS  program, the Government reserves the unilateral right to extend this restriction beyond the minimum two (2) year period whenever doing so is unilaterally determined by the Government to be required to avoid or mitigate against the risk of OCIs.  The Gover nment reserves the unilateral right to impose, on a case-by-case basis, the same restrictions for contractors or key contractor personnel previously engaged in Program Development category work subsequently seeking Program Management category work.  The Go vernment reserves the unilateral right to determine key personnel status for purposes of this clause. The Contractor's attention is drawn to FAR Sections 3 and 9 for reference.// Examples of Program Management contracts include, but are not limited to, the PMI contract, PMI BPA, and D/SIDDOMS II  Lot 1.  If a contractor has or is performing working under these contracts or others in support of TMA, those contractors may still part icipate in the D/SIDDOMS 3 solicitation; however, if awarded a D/SIDDOMS 3 contract as a prime contractor, subcontractor, or consultant, they will be required to apply with the conditions stated above.// Teaming Arrangements for D/SIDDOMS 3: The Government is looking for best value contractor approaches to achieve the tasking outlined in the RFP.  Consistent with the D/SIDDOMS 3 Organizational Conflict of Interest clause, the FAR, the DFARS and AFARS, the Government requires in every proposal for every order under D/SIDDOMS 3, specific information about proposed subcontractors, consultants and key personnel.  Such information will include, at minimum, the prior TMA contract and delivery or task order history of such firms and personnel.  If the  proposed use of such firms or personnel raises questions of potential real or apparent OCIs, the contractor will be required to note such questions and propose appropriate mitigation plans.  However, notwithstanding any such mitigation plan submitted in a ny such proposal, the Government reserves the right not to award any such order on grounds of a real or apparent OCI which the Government has unilaterally determined would not be adequately mitigated.  The Government is imposing an additional restriction o n the teaming approach that each vendor may propose as a subcontractor multiple times but no prime contractor can be a subcontractor to another prime.  Additionally, on each task/delivery order, prime contractors will need to identify the specific, preappr ove subcontractors that will be used, the primary role of the subcontractor, the labor categories, rates and estimated or fixed level of effort for each subcontractor.
