<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive. Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award. Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<br /><br />Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.<br /><br />21. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer James Headington, 405-855-3535, James.Headington.1@us.af.mil</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) intends to negotiate and award a contract for one high-throughput flow system (HTFS) capable of exerting physiological shear stresses on human endothelial cell monolayers growing on standard Transwell&reg; inserts in a 96-well plate.</p>
<p>EXTENT OF COMPETITION<br />This acquisition is full and open with no set-aside restrictions.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a Size Standard of 1000 employees.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY<br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC): FAC_2019-01 dated January 22, 2019.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 15-contracting by Negotiations at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($250,000).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT <br />Background<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>The 3-D Tissue Bioprinting Group at NCATS is invested in developing therapeutically relevant three-dimensional tissues for basic research and drug screening. Experts at NCATS are applying the techniques of 3-D printing to develop tissue models that mimic the 3-D structure and organization of cells in the tissues of living organisms. To achieve therapeutic relevance, certain projects must incorporate mechanical cues to create a physiologically relevant cell environment. The incorporation of shear stress is important for vascular projects, as cell function is influenced by mechanical cues, and the Transwell&reg; system is positioned to enable research on many such vascular environments, such as the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain a commercially available (with or without modificaitosn) high-throughput flow system (HTFS) capable of exerting physiological shear stresses on human endothelial cell monolayers that are growing on standard Transwell&reg; inserts in a 96-well plate and cultured with astrocytes on opposites sides of a membrane which mimic a blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Project Requirements <br />The Government seeks to acquire a HTFS for a standard 96-well plate format that utilizes cone-and-plate shear to create adjustable shear stresses with hemodynamic waveforms in each well.  The system shall be compatible with existing cell culture laboratory incubators, allowing for temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide control.  The system shall contain 8 motors, so that shear stress can be controlled independently in groupings of 12 wells within a single plate.<br /> <br />The following project specification are deemed essential to this acquisition.  The system must:</p>
<p>(1)	Apply adjustable shear stresses and hemodynamic waveforms to endothelial cell monolayers growing on standard Transwell&reg; inserts in a 96-well place;</p>
<p>(2)	Apply shear stress in a manner that does not decrease the viability of cells in the monolayer;<br /> <br />(3)	Be compatible with standard 96-well plate format;</p>
<p>(4)	Fit into a standard culture incubator, with electronics and hardware reliable for extended (1 week) operation without corrosion or other failure modes;</p>
<p>(5)	Control mechanical cues independently between group of 12 wells in a single plate;</p>
<p>(6)	Allow for easy access to tissue on both sides of membrane for media changes and imaging during culture period;</p>
<p>(7)	Maintain temperature stability in incubator of +/- 1&deg;C;</p>
<p>(8)	Produce shear stress control of +/- 2dyn/cm2 estimated from modeling and geometric/motor waveform measurements and spot-checked in the system.</p>
<p>Delivery<br />Delivery is expected within 10-12 months ARO.</p>
<p>CLOSING STATEMENT<br />The solicitation will be issued on or about Febraury 15, 2019 and bids or proposals will be tentatively due about 30 days after the solicitation release date.</p>
<p>Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from the Contract Specialist, Hunter Tjugum, electronically at hunter.tjugum@nih.gov. Please reference the solicitation on your electronic request.</p>

<CONTACT>Benjamin R. Peterson, Contracting Officer, Phone 8017754694, Email benjamin.peterson.8@us.af.mil
<DESC><p><strong>NOTICE</strong>: This is not a solicitation but rather a&nbsp;Sources Sought Synopsis&nbsp;to determine&nbsp;interest within&nbsp;Industry, and&nbsp;for information and planning purposes only.<br /><br />Interested Sources are encouraged to repond to the attached Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) to ensure the A-10 Division has the most current and accurate data moving forward. This potential requirement is for engineering services in support of the A-10 Aircraft; specifically, this&nbsp;requirement is for the Central Interface Control Unit (CICU) program as detailed below:<br /><br /><strong>PROGRAM DETAILS</strong>: This anticipated program is to&nbsp;modify the A-10 aircraft by redesigning the&nbsp;CICU. Due to its Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) there is a limited pool of critical component parts for SRU production &amp; repair that deem the current CICU parts supportable for 2-5 more years assuming current demand and failure rates. A redesigned CICU is the most viable option for the Air Force that improves maintainability and is the best option for enduring the A-10 fleet.<br /><br />The scope of this requirement is to completely redesign the CICU to improve reliability and improve functionality within the A-10 Avionics suite..<br /><br /><strong>NOTES</strong>:</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal (RFP) or an invitation for bid, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this SSS for information or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein. Only non-classified information shall be provided in your response, and your response should be reviewed to assure that there are not any operational sensitivities identified.</p>
<p>Contract performance may also involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center, and have an approved DD Form 2345, will be provided copies of any related solicitation (including DRAFT RFP) or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions.</p>
<p>Additional market research will be conducted in the near future, and it is anticipated that an Industry Day for this program will be held on or about 26&nbsp;March 2019. A formal notice of Industry Day will be posted to this Announcement if plans and criteria for an idustry day solidify.<br /><br />Please keep in mind the due date of&nbsp;8 February for responses to this&nbsp;Sources Sought.&nbsp;Any questions or concerns can be submitted to the Contracting Officer. Thank you for your consideration of this request; the A-10 SPO looks forward to learning who is interested in this program.</p>

The explosive lead or M7 Blasting Cap attaches to the output assembly with the attached stem nut. The stem nut is equipped with standard priming adapter male-threaded protrusion so the M17A1 receiver may be easily connected to most standard demolition charges and devices with cap wells. The M17A1 receiver system modes are program, test, and fire. The arming switches allow the user to arm the M17A1 receiver which starts a five minute safe separation time (arming delay). During the arming cycle, the M17A1 receiver will not function until the five minute safe separation time (arming delay) has elapsed. The M17A1 receiver weighs approximately 0.8 lb. (0.36 kg) with battery installed. Six M17A1 and twelve explosive leads are packaged in a PA108 metal container, and one PA108 metal container per wirebound box.</span></p>

Any programmed M85A1 training receiver will electronically decode a fire signal received from the MK26 Transmitter and produce an output signal indicated by the blinking of the output assembly (stem nut). The blinking light simulates blasting cap initiation. The M85A1 training receiver is not a separate item of issue. The training kit consists of two M85A1 training receivers, four inert leads, two instruction sheets, one stem tool, two antenna wires, and four spare trainer stem housing assemblies packed in a PA108 metal container.</span></p>

In addition, buried utilities have a limited service life and it is crucial to assess their condition throughout their life cycles to avoid potential catastrophic failure due to their deterioration. Thousands of excavations are carried out within the U.S. road network each year to relocate, install or repair buried utility pipes and cables. Additionally, utilities are often exposed as roadway construction occurs in their vicinity. The precise location of existing buried utilities is mostly unknown to highway agencies. Not knowing the location of buried assets causes practical problems that increase costs and delay projects, but more importantly, it increases the risk of injury to project personnel and damage to, utilities which can have ripple effects far beyond the project boundaries. The problems associated with inaccurate location of buried pipes and cables are serious and are rapidly worsening due to the increasing density of underground infrastructure in major urban areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Buried utility conflicts and relocations are </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;">one of the largest contributors </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;">for project delays during road construction. </span></p>

The second Strategic Highway Renewal Program (SHRP 2) Project R01B, Encouraging Innovation in Locating and Characterizing Underground Utilities, focused on geophysical tools and accompanying software for locating and mapping buried utilities. Existing GPR equipment and software systems was used as a platform in this project. However, the reliability of detection in certain environment or on certain material types (i.e., plastic pipes) have been poor, and it requires extensive expertise to operate the equipment and accurately analyzing data. In addition, the SHRP2 project used an innovative shear wave imaging system to provide detection capabilities similar to GPR for soils where GPR is not an effective tool. However, a practical prototype that incorporates seismic technology has not been fully developed.</span></p>

10.  SERVICES NOT COVERED UNDER THIS CONTRACT

Per VHA Cranial Prosthesis Policy PSAS can provide a wig to male and female Veterans who have alopecia, (hair loss or baldness) either primary or chemotherapy induced.  Wigs can be synthetic or of natural hair.  PSAS does not provide for the maintenance of the wig which includes cleaning, trimming, dying or otherwise coloring the hair.   Because natural hair wigs and their maintenance are more expensive than synthetic hair wigs, Veterans should be advised of the additional expense.   With proper maintenance and depending on the length of time worn, a wig may be used a lengthy amount of time. A wig should be replaced no more than once every 12 months. 

In the case of transgender Veterans, PSAS can provide a wig with the same parameters as noted above for maintenance and replacement frequency. For transgender women if the Veteran has significant hair loss and her medical provider documents the medical necessity of a female style wig to support her identity and treatment plan, PSAS can provide a wig. A wig is not provided if the Veteran has a full head of hair that can be styled as a female. For transgender men the hair can be cut and styled such to support the appearance of being male. If there is hair loss as noted above, a male hair style wig can be provided.

Examples of services not covered include, but are not limited to:
Laser Caps
Scalp Treatments
Hair color, cut and style
Non-commercial, experimental, or non-FDA approved treatments or products 
Styling products

REQUIRED REGISTRATIONS

Required Registration with Contractor Performance System (CPS): As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $100,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials.  The FAR requires that that the contractor is provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing.  To fulfill this requirement, VA uses an online database, the Contractor Performance System (CPS), which is maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The CPS database information is shared with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies.

You are required to register with the NIH CPS database at the following web address: https://cpscontractor.nih.gov

Further, your registered representative data, as well as any other information in your registration data, must be kept current.  Performance evaluations entered CPS by the contracting officer will be assigned to the contractor s registered representative for comment.  Failure to comment and reassign the report back to the contracting officer, or to maintain current registration, will result in the Government s evaluation being entered in the database with a statement that you have failed to respond.

Help in registering can be obtained by contacting CPS Support E-mail (cps-support-1@list.nih.gov) or by calling (301) 451-2771.

System for Award Management (SAM): Pursuant to FAR Clause 52.212-4, para (t), System for Award Management (SAM) after initial registration, the contractor is required to update registration data as changes occur and must re-register annually to ensure all data remains current.  Noncompliance with this requirement will preclude the exercising of any option periods that may be included herein and will be cause for termination of the contract at such time noncompliance is discovered.  Refer to cited Clause for more details. https://sam.gov/ 

REPORTING

These reports shall be received by the Government Contracting Officer not later than the 15th day of each month following the end of each quarter of the Government Fiscal Year (October 15th, January 15th, April 15th, and July 15th).

The purpose of this sources sought notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) The availability and capability of qualified sources/ availability of competition; and (2) the business size and socioeconomic status (e.g. small or large business, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small business; woman-owned small business; woman-owned small businesses; small disadvantage businesses; or large business), relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The Government will utilize this information in determining an acquisition strategy, including whether a set-aside is possible.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>BACKGROUND: Approximately 1000 employees of the Institute's staff including contractors are located in the David P. Rail Building which was constructed in the early I980's. Additionally, 300 NIEHS employees are located in the Keystone Building approximately 1.5 miles from the NIEHS main Campus. From its opening, a full service cafeteria has been in operation on the first floor this building. Specifically, the cafeteria occupies about 7000 square feet of the first floor of A Module; the cafeteria adjoins the Institute's main conference center. In January 2002, the Institute completed a major renovation of the entire cafeteria. This renovation incorporated the latest design for food service and preparation. Breakfast, lunch and snacks are served five days a week. The incumbent contractor is currently experiencing a customer count of approximately 725 per day. However, the Government recognizes a potential for this number to increase. The cafeteria is an important component of the Institute's benefit package to its employees. It is in the Institute's best interest to attract as many staff as possible to the cafeteria to promote the exchange of information, reduce the amount of traffic leaving the Institute for lunch and promote the efficiency of our operations.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this effort is to provide high quality, nutritious food and food services to the employees of NIEHS. This includes providing a clean, safe and attractive serving and dining area, reasonable prices for food and a variety of food offerings. The contractor shall provide a variety of menu options, including a hot vegetarian selection containing no meat, fish or poultry at each meal.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The objective of this effort is to provide a convenient, affordable place for employees to buy meals and snacks without having to leave the Institute's grounds. The contractor is expected to attract increasing numbers of customers. The contractor shall provide all management, personnel and training to operate the NIEHS onsite cafeteria, and catering service as specified herein.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The Government anticipates a one-year (12 month) base contract with four (4) one year option periods.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE: The intended procurement will be classified under the NAICS code 722514 &ndash; Cafeterias, Grill Buffets, and Buffets</div>

<DESC>**Note: This is a Request for Information only posting** <br />Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) is looking for short range radars that can provide reliable detection and low false positives in a two-fence high security perimeter environment. Candidate radars will be tested to verify they can meet or exceed all United States (US) government physical intrusion detection requirements, including a nuisance alarm rate of 1 nuisance alarm per day (or less) in all weather conditions and be capable of detecting runners, walkers, and crawlers within the two-fence perimeter. The fences run parallel to each other and can be 30 to 60 feet apart. Detection range of the threats specified must be at least 350m. The targeted design life of the system is 10 or more years. The minimum alarm update rate is 2 Hz, the horizontal field of view should be 120 degrees or larger, the vertical field of view must be 30 degrees or larger. The radar may be used in a stand-alone configuration or may be "fused" with other sensors. If Sandia chooses to fuse the radar with other sensors, the data stream produced by the radar will be fed into Sandia developed advanced statistical algorithms and fused with one or more volumetric sensors with complementary phenomenologies. The resulting technology will more accurately detect intruders and differentiate intruders from nuisance alarm sources during all weather conditions and animals.

<p>The proposed project is to provide all labor, material, and equipment necessary to Construct a high-bay C-5 aircraft maintenance hangar (approx. 105,000 SF) with reinforced concrete foundation and floor slab, masonry exterior walls on the office area and metal sandwich panels on the hangar area, electrically operated hangar doors, structural steel frame, architecturally compatible roof, fire protection and alarm system, utilities, secure and non-secure communications, site improvements, and other necessary support. Demolish Building 2426 and haul debris to the landfill in accordance with regulations upon completion of the project.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>(a)Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b)An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(1)Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2)Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a.Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation.</p>
<p>b.Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>c.Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would affect the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>d.Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>e.Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>f.Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>g.Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>

<DESC><p>This synopsis provides the Government's intent to award a sole source modification to extend the period of performance of contract HHSA290201400003C "Publications, Media and Marketing". This cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract was originally competed and awarded to BLH Technologies, Inc., 1803 Research Blvd, Suite 500, Rockville, MD 20850 on February 1, 2014. The current contract ends on January 31, 2019. The proposed modification will extend the contract for an additional 4 months, through May 31, 2019.</p>
<p>The current contract (HHSA290201400003C) is to assist the Office of Communications (OC) of AHRQ in managing and coordinating the agency's print and electronic publishing; media outreach, communications planning and monitoring; and marketing. This will be a sole source modification to continue existing work for an additional 4 months. The proposed modification action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The extension of the services under the current contract was unforeseeable and not due to lack of planning. BLH is the only contractor that can perform this work to maintain the quality, validity, and consistency of the services and deliverables provided under this contract. BLH has been the only contractor performing this work over the past 5 years and the use of another contractor would significantly increase the possibility of a disruption to these services. Another contractor would not be able to immediately provide these services to seamlessly continue operations.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government as to whether or not to compete this proposed modification action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties regarding this sole source action may contact the contract specialist, Robert Zuhlke, at Robert.Zuhlke@ahrq.hhs.gov no later than 10:00 AM, EST, February 7, 2019. The final Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) supporting this this sole source action will be made publicly available as required.</p>

<DESC> Notice of Intent to Sole Source- Cepheid Reagents & Consumables-36C25019Q0311

The VISN 10, Network Contracting Office (NCO 10) hereby gives notice of the Government s intent to sole source an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) base year plus four (4) option years contract to Cepheid: 904 Caribbean Drive, Sunnyvale, CA 94089. The IDIQ will be used as a procurement vehicle to acquire reagents and consumables for the Cepheid GeneXpert System currently used at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center, Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service, 3200 Vine Street, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45220.
This analyzer performs C. difficile, N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, Factor II & Factor V, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Flu testing.  Only cartridges manufactured by Cepheid will work with this analyzer.   It is proprietary in nature and the configuration is such that only a specific cartridge will fit into the analyzer.
NCO10 intends to sole source this contract action in accordance with (IAW) FAR Subpart 13.5. Market Research was conducted IAW FAR Part 10. A source sought notice (SSN), 36C25019Q0197, was posted to FBO and received one response. The respondent to the SSN was the original manufacturer- Cepheid. Market research determined that this contract action is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.
The non-manufacturer rule applies to this procurement, because of the anticipated dollar threshold, and no current Small Business Administration (SBA) wavier for the assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and Federal Supply Code (FSC) exists; therefore, this procurement is ineligible for a small business set-aside. The assigned NAICS is 325413, and the FSC is 6505.
Please do not request a copy of a solicitation.  This notice is neither a request for competitive proposals, nor is it a solicitation of offers. Any response to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and any capability statement provided must address services listed above. 
Written communication received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative written response is received on or before February 1, 2019, 3:30PM EST, the contract will be awarded without further notice.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email at Ronetta.Sweeney@va.gov .  A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 
THIS SYNOPSIS DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTRACT FOR ANY SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS.

<p class="MsoNormal">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">is offering the opportunity to partner to further develop and license for commercialization its novel technology combining additively manufactured parts with an infill step for customizable and novel energetic systems.</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Background</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fine spatial control of material placement now possible with additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing, is enabling for both processing and controlling the properties and performance of energetic materials. Energetic materials, or simply energetics, are monomolecular materials or composite formulations which can exothermically react through chemical reactions. Some examples of energetic materials are propellants, explosives, pyrotechnics, and reactive formulations such as intermetallic mixtures and thermite composites.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There exists a need to develop energetic components with optimized safety and performance for a variety of applications, as well as to reduce the cost of doing HE-driven experiments (e.g., producing a planar shock wave) to evaluate inert materials or other energetic materials.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Description</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Livermore Lab researchers have developed a method that combines additive manufacturing (AM) with an infill step to render a final component which is energetic. In this case, AM is first used to print a part of the system, and this material can either be inert or energetic on its own. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>A second material issubsequently added to the structure via a second technique such as casting, melt infiltration, a second AM step/process, or other deposition techniques. The result is a final energetic part with some desired safety and/or performance properties. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Advantages</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">There are several major advantages of this technique. First, this approach allows the strategic placement of one material (energetic, or not) into the final assembly. Such applications would be metallized explosives, where the HE/metal response can be tailored by the placement of the metal into a preformed scaffold. Second, by intentionally leaving out one component of the energetic system until desired, the part may be made safer to handle or secure from insult. Once the final material is infilled into the part, it behaves as intended. A third application is to use AM to print custom molds for explosives, which are then filled with a castable energetic to produce complex geometries such as plane wave generators. Post processing may be necessary to render the final part, depending on the application.</span></p>

<DESC>You have been invited to the first Big Data collaborative event of its kind to be held in Corona CA. After reviewing the event description below, I encourage you to reserve your seat for this event using the following registration link as this event will reach capacity quickly:
<p><strong>https://einvitations.afit.edu/inv/anim.cfm?i=431412&amp;k=0662430D7A55</strong></p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Big Data: Data Analytics, Infrastructure, Management, Security and Visualization</span></p>
<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division (NSWC Corona) will be hosting the next event for the In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) of the Future initiative on February 27-28, 2019. The forum will be held at&nbsp;the following&nbsp;location: The February 27th and 28th forum will be at Corona City Hall - Council Chamber located at 400 South Vicentia Avenue, Corona, CA 92882.</p>
<p>The theme of this event is centered on "Big Data: Data Analytics, Infrastructure, management, Security and Visualization"and will consist of an in-depth review of the problems, issues, barriers, challenges, and opportunities associated with ISEA of the Future implementation of Big Data technologies. Following on from the events held in August and November 2018 at NSWC Port Hueneme Division, NSWC Corona seeks interest from industry, academia, and state, local and federal entities capable of providing expertise, capabilities, facilities and experience relative to this subject that would like to participate in discussions with the ISEA community.</p>
<p>Topics:</p>
<p>Big Data Means Big Bandwidth: An emphasis has been put on increased immersive ship support by ISEA personnel utilizing AR/VR, digital twin, etc. but this requires massive amounts of data to be sent/received. Faced with the current and most likely future limitations sea to shore bandwidth, how should the Navy ISEA community address this issue?</p>
<p>Disparate Data Solutions - Organizing the Data Junk Drawer: The Navy utilizes many sources of data to produce a coherent set of information that can be utilized for analysis. This data is abundant and often times unstructured, incongruent, incomplete or incorrect. How can the Navy best manage, aggregate and utilize disparate data without creating negative side-effects associated with use of enterprise applications (one size fits all), brute force methods (no analysis and design, just development), and over-analysis of data requirements (no development, just analysis and design)?</p>
<p>Data Visualization - Rebranding as Knowledge Transparency: Navy leaders are faced with challenges to quickly acquire the knowledge for decision making due to data visualization quality, biases, over-complexity, and inapplicability. How can the Navy move towards an environment and culture where leaders have access to quick, concise, and robust actionable knowledge utilizing the most advanced visualization methods?</p>
<p>Cybersecurity - The New Cold War Heats Up: The current Navy and DoD cybersecurity realm is vast, ever-changing, and relatively uncharted. The existing data security methods are most likely not sufficient for big data needs. What are the cybersecurity challenges associated with big data, how can the Navy establish a clear concise direction forward, and are there resources outside of the DoD that should be utilized in collaboration for the common goal of ensuring cybersecurity?</p>

Nickel-rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials to address these issues due to their high reversible capacities (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&gt;</span>200 mAh/g). Recent efforts have focused on formulations with small amounts of cobalt, manganese, and aluminum for better structural stability, safety, and cycle life, but cobalt remains an expensive component. The Ni-rich cathode material in this invention replaces cobalt with a different element, decreasing the cost and increasing the capacity (~220 mAh/g) without compromising electrochemical performance. </span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION:</span></strong> <br />The Government is planning an Industry Day to discuss the removal of a submerged concrete sill (located at the US Marine Corps Support Facility - Blount Island (MCSF-BI's). The concrete&nbsp;sill is heavily reinforced with rebar. The concete sill is located at station 7+00 in the MCSF-BI slipway and is 32.6 feet wide by 426.5 feet long and approximately 14.5 feet deep. The concrete sill was constructed on top of rock at approximately -52 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). The crest elevation of the concrete sill is -37.6 feet MLLW. A substantial portion of the concrete sill is to be removed (9.4 feet) resulting in a maximum crest elevation of -47 feet MLLW. Sediments may need to be cleared around the concrete sill to allow access to the structure, and this material may be disposed in the Dayson Island (D/A-D) Dredge Material Placement Facility (DMPF) which is approximately 2.7 miles from the concrete sill location or in another manner in accordance with the Specifications. All concrete and reinforcement bars from the concrete sill and any insitu rock removed from the slipway shall be disposed of at on off-site location and shall not be placed into D/A-D. Safe navigation in and out of MCSF-BI shall be maintained throughout removal of the concrete sill operations. The Contractor shall use a diamond wire saw to cut out the submerged concrete sill. Blasting is prohibited.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Prefilled IV Flush Syringes. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MN-1806-67_Prefilled_IV_Flush_ Syringes are eligible for participation. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Prefilled IV Flush Syringes products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MN-1806-67_Prefilled_IV_Flush_Syringes. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 11 Mar 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MN-1806-67_Prefilled_IV_Flush_Syringes, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Prefilled IV Flush Syringes.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Prefilled IV Flush Syringes. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $1,813,266 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MN-1806-67_Prefilled_IV_Flush_Syringes who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO North via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements.

Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification.

DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price evaluation is based on the sum of each required item's offered IA unit price multiplied by number of estimated units.

The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes, but reserves the right to seek further discounts or request revised quotes if determined necessary.<br /><strong>&bull; In order to be eligible for selection, vendors are required to have established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line by time of selection.<br />&bull; Failure to establish a DAPA with approved base uncommitted pricing will preclude a vendor from being selected to establish an IA with the government.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />MMESO North Data Analyst, Mr. Juan Gonzales, 571-231-5547, juan.a.gonzales8.ctr@mail.mil and MMESO North Team Leader, Ms. Vivian Alexander, 571-231-5451, vivian.r.alexander.ctr@mail.mil.

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Syringes. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MN-1802-55_Syringes are eligible for participation. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Syringes products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MN-1802-55_Syringes. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 11 Mar 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MN-1802-55_Syringes, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Syringes.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Syringes. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $1,329,109 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MN-1802-55_Syringes, who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO North via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $250,000.00.  A Fixed-Price type of contract is contemplated for any resulting contract entered as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) Number/Effective Date: 2019-01 / 01-22-2019.</p>
<p>(iv) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with size standard 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>(v) Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>NCATS is equipped with several acoustic dispensing instruments.  These instruments can transfer small volumes of liquid (in the nL range) from a source plate to a destination of plate of any well density.  These capabilities have enabled the establishment of Matrix screening where multiple compounds or drugs are screened against one another in a dose response fashion.  Over time this has become a standard method of screening at NCATS and is one of the core technologies provided by the Research Service and Support (RSS) group.</p>
<p>The adoption of acoustic dispensing has grown beyond just being used for Matrix screening to a variety of other applications, increasing the need for a diverse set of instruments to keep up with the growing demand.  This demand became even more pressing upon completion of the NIH Small Molecule Repository contract (HHSN271201200003I) with the work previously being performed by Evotec Inc. and now becoming the responsibility of NCATS.  A key piece of equipment put into use during the contract was a LabCyte Echo acoustic dispenser which has now become a critical component of a variety of RSS operations involving the creation of assay ready plates. This growing demand has led to the need for additional acoustic dispensers not just for assay ready plates but to be used as a general laboratory instrument for assay development projects beyond just being used to dispense small molecules solubilized in DMSO but nearly any aqueous media.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective: The purpose of this requirement is to obtain one (1) High-throughput tube-enabled system with Liquid Handlers and barcode readers and accessories on a BRAND-NAME-OR-EQUAL basis to the Echo655T and Echo655 and accessories manufactured by Labcyte, Inc located at 170 Rose Orchard Way, San Jose, CA, 95134.</p>
<p>Product Description: Products offered must include those salient physical, functional, or other characteristics that are deemed essential in meeting the government's needs. Specifically, the following are considered the salient characteristics for this requirement:</p>

<p>2. Supports a variety of reagent types; including DMSO, PCR and qPCR reagents, synthetic biology reagents, NGS reagents, primers and probes, cell culture media, proteins, nucleic acids, up to 50% glycerol, serum, plasma, antibodies, enzymes, and protein crystallography reagents.</p>
<p>3. Not require any reagent specific calibration.</p>
<p>4. Transfers multiple fluid types and volumes from one plate into another plate enabling rapid assay creation from one source plate.</p>
<p>5. Capable of up dispensing over 750,000 samples/day.</p>
<p>6. Must be a completely non-contact dispenser; not requiring tips, nozzles, or pin tools during fluid transfer eliminating the possibility of samples adhering to the tips, tip carryover, or tip leachates entering the sample.</p>
<p>7. Transfers samples acoustically from a source plate to an inverted destination plate transferring reagents in One-well-to-one-well for plate replication in 384 and 1536 well patterns; One-well-to-many-wells for distributing solutions to destination plates containing 1 - &ge;3456 wells or target locations; Any-well-to-any-well enabling cherry picking, hit picking, and reformatting of solutions to destination plates containing 1 - &ge;3456 wells or target locations.</p>
<p>8. Capable of continuous 24/7 operation.</p>
<p>9. Includes Echo expansion software, or equivalent, for cherry picking and IC50 via a standard, non-custom interface with ability to manipulate cherry picking.</p>

<p>1.	Describe Chinese policies for the development of "smart cities." What specific policy plans have the central, provincial, and local governments developed to foster smart cities? What key attributes are Chinese smart cities expected to contain and what role are smart cities expected to play in China's development strategies? How do smart cities align with China's domestic security, industrial policy, and foreign policy objectives? How does the central government coordinate smart city development, and what role do local governments play in rolling out the concept? Identify environmental, mass transit, water infrastructure, broadband/5G, surveillance, and other objectives for smart city development.</p>
<p>2.	Describe China's development of smart cities, particularly key enabling technologies including 5G, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, and block chain.  How is the government (central and local) funding the development of smart cities? What kind of support (financial, regulatory, etc.) has the Chinese government provided to its domestic firms, research institutes, and universities? How successful have those efforts been? What are the challenges to enhancing those capabilities? What cooperative development programs for smart cities has China engaged in or announced with foreign entities (governmental, business, or academic)?</p>
<p>3.	Assess China's application of mass surveillance in smart cities. To what extent are smart city technologies enabling mass surveillance? Does China's application of mass surveillance in smart cities differ from other countries?</p>
<p>4.	Evaluate U.S. capabilities and China's in development and deployment of smart city technologies. In which technologies and applications has China gained an edge, and how? How is this competitive landscape likely to evolve in the next 5-10 years? What are the implications for U.S. global competitiveness and national security? How should the U.S. government and U.S. Congress mitigate the security and privacy risks and improve U.S. economic competitiveness in smart cities?</p>
<p>5.	Describe China's promotion of its smart city technologies abroad. What tools has the Chinese government used to promote Chinese technologies, standards, and concept of smart cities abroad, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative? Where is initial deployment occurring, and how effective have these efforts been? What future plans has the Chinese government announced? What are the implications for U.S. foreign policy objectives, national security, and global competitiveness?</p>
<p>6.	Evaluate the role of Chinese products in U.S. smart city critical infrastructure. How reliant are the U.S. local and municipal governments and providers of critical infrastructure and services (e.g., port authorities, emergency responders) on Chinese firms and Chinese-made products and services? What are the potential vulnerabilities from U.S. usage of Chinese-designed or -manufactured technologies in U.S. smart cities to U.S. economic health, national security, democracy, privacy, and supply chain integrity? Are these risks unique to Chinese-designed or -manufactured technologies? How are local and municipal governments addressing those risks? Are there any standards or protocols that exist to promote proper security protocols regarding deployment of products/services for smart cities?  What are the types and volume of data Chinese firms are collecting or are capable of collecting from products and services they provide to U.S. smart cities? What role does the U.S. government play in overseeing smart city technologies or deployment? Should the U.S. government and Congress take additional steps to mitigate any risks arising from the use of Chinese smart city technology?</p>
<p>The report should include an executive summary of the report's key findings; a brief overview of the sources and analytic methodology used for the report; and a brief explanation of the scope and limitations of the report.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div>ABOUT PROPOSALS. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on China's space and counterspace capabilities and activities.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>ABOUT THE COMMISSION. The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov.</div>
<div>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in Pub. L. No. 113-291, Section 1259B), which states, "The Commission ... shall investigate and report ... on..."</p>
<p>"(A) The role of the People's Republic of China in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other weapon systems (including systems and technologies of a dual use nature), including actions the United States might take to encourage the People's Republic of China to cease such practices.</p>
<p>(B) The qualitative and quantitative nature of the transfer of United States production activities to the People's Republic of China, including the relocation of manufacturing, advanced technology and intellectual property, and research and development facilities, the impact of such transfers on the national security of the United States (including the dependence of the national security industrial base of the United States on imports from China), the economic security of the United States, and employment in the United States, and the adequacy of United States export control laws in relation to the People's Republic of China."</p>
<p>"(E) The military plans, strategy and doctrine of the People's Republic of China, the structure and organization of the People's Republic of China military, the decision-making process of the People's Republic of China military, the interaction between the civilian and military leadership in the People's Republic of China, the development and promotion process for leaders in the People's Republic of China military, deployments of the People's Republic of China military, resources available to the People's Republic of China military (including the development and execution of budgets and the allocation of funds), force modernization objectives and trends for the People's Republic of China military, and the implications of such objectives and trends for the national security of the United States.</p>
<p>(F) The strategic economic and security implications of the cyber capabilities and operations of the People's Republic of China."</p>
<p>"(H) The drivers, nature, and implications of the growing economic, technological, political, cultural, people-to-people, and security relations of the People's Republic of China's with other countries, regions, and international and regional entities (including multilateral organizations), including the relationship among the United States, Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China."</p>
<p>This report's key research requirements are:</p>
<p>1.	Assess China's current military and dual-use space and counterspace capabilities and potential future capabilities that put at risk U.S. space assets and those of its allies and partners. Briefly describe China's space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, including its ocean surveillance network, and its near-, medium-, and long-term objectives to enhance its space-based ISR network. How do these assets enable or enhance the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) ability to operate at greater distances from the Chinese mainland, and how will these capabilities improve in the future? Assess China's kinetic and non-kinetic ground- and space-based counterspace capabilities, including a discussion of how these could be employed to target U.S. space assets or those of U.S. allies and partners. How is China seeking to improve its space situational awareness capabilities, and what is the status of China's space-based early warning capabilities? What are the trends in China's use of space-based communications, and what are its plans to use microsatellites and other technologies to enhance the survivability of its ISR and communications constellations? Describe any tests or concepts that China has explored for spaceplanes, space-to-air vehicles, and space-to-ground weapons programs.</p>
<p>2.	Assess China's progress in operationalizing its military space and counterspace programs since the establishment of the PLA Strategic Support Force (SSF) in 2015. Identify the SSF's operational space units and assess current and future trends in their operational status, including their integration into the PLA's training cycle. Describe how, if at all, the re-subordination of most military space programs under the SSF has impacted China's counterspace and space launch capabilities and how these capabilities could develop in the future. Assess the impact of China's current military reorganization and reform efforts on its ability to realize its space ambitions. Assess the SSF's ability to conduct both kinetic and non-kinetic counterspace activities by 2020 and 2035.</p>
<p>3.	Assess the PLA's success in leveraging China's civilian space capabilities and research and development (R&amp;D) programs to support its development of operational capabilities. What role have China's aerospace defense conglomerates and civilian space industry played in building its military space program, as is outlined in China's military-civilian fusion strategy? How has the PLA harnessed research benefits from China's lunar exploration program, including its activities on the far side of the moon? Assess China's dual-use communications and jamming capabilities in deep space. How dependent is China's space program on global supply chains and foreign technology or deemed exports, overseas R&amp;D collaboration (in particular with the United States and U.S. allies and partners), and overseas support infrastructure? Have any notable exchanges occurred between U.S. and Chinese entities that were either in violation of legal restrictions on U.S.-China cooperation on space or allowable under specified exceptions? In light of Hong Kong's special treatment granted by the United States under the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, is there evidence China has used Hong Kong-based companies to access or acquire space technology that is otherwise subject to U.S. export controls?</p>
<p>4.	Assess the status of China's international space activities. What are the contract terms and financing sources for manufacturing or launch services China has provided for other countries? What is the status and present implementation of contracts or agreements China has signed with other countries to allow China to build or maintain space infrastructure (including ground control or observation facilities), provide or manage launch services, and participate in bilateral, multilateral, and international space programs? What are China's regulatory policies concerning shared tasking and distribution of data obtained by space assets or through ground stations constructed for international clients? Describe any space-related components of China's recent military exercises with international partners. Are there any recent changes in China's willingness to share access to its satellite constellations, or access to particular capabilities of its satellite constellations, with international partners and to export more advanced space technology?</p>
<p>The report should include an executive summary of the report's key findings; a brief overview of the sources and analytic methodology used for the report; and a brief explanation of the scope and limitations of the report.</p>

<DESC><strong>The purpose of amendment 002 is to post answers to questions posed in response to this solicitation and to extend the solicitation closing date to January 29, 2019<br /><br /></strong>Question 1:&nbsp; The request specifies "Packer system (compatible with pressure transducer)". Could you please clarify what compatibility is required? Most packers do not have the ability to measure downhole pressure, and therefore have no interaction with the surface pressure transducer. Does the packer system require the ability to measure pressure downhole directly at the packer, or is the only pressure measurement occurring on surface? <br /><br />Answer:&nbsp; The specification requires a packer system that has a pressure transducer within the test interval, down hole. The specification requires measurement of pressures with a transducer below the packer for a single packer system and below the top packer for a dual packer system.
<p>Question 2: The request specifies for the packer system "220 feet of air pressure line and cable". Could you please clarify what "cable" is referring to? Is this referring to the packer rod/hose that is used to lower or place the packer into the hole?<br /><br />Answer: "Cable" refers to a communication cable that is connected between the data logger at the ground surface and a pressure transducer located down hole within the test interval.</p>
<p>Question 3: The packer system specifies "Packer system (multiple components)". Could you please clarify what "multiple components" is referring to? Is only a single element packer required, or is a double element packer required?<br /><br />Answer: The solicitation requests a packer system that can function both as a single packer system and a double packer system. Please include any extra equipment needed.</p>
<p>Question 4: The replacement packer parts specify a gland of 1 m. Are there any ranges of gland sizes that are acceptable (for the supplied packer and the replacement gland), or does it have to be specifically 1 m.<br /><br />Answer: The replacement packer should be the same packer as included in the contractor's bid. It does not have to be specifically 1 meter. The packer should be purpose built for geotechnical water testing and conform to test equipment capable to meet ASTM standard D 4630.</p>
<p>Question 5: In the delivery section it mentions, "the equipment shall be delivered under its own power". Could you please clarify the meaning to this? Does this mean the system, while in operation, needs to provide its own power through something such as a generator? If so, are there any requested specifications for the power source?<br /><br />Answer: We are requesting the delivery of the equipment (based on the shipping rate you choose and to be included in your quote package). It is not to power to the unit.</p>
<strong><br />************************************************************<br /><br />The purpose of amendment 001 is to post answers to questions posed in response to this solicitation.<br /></strong><br />Question 1: Does the Pressure Transducer/System include the packers or is it simply "compatible" per the description?
<p>Answer: Yes, the solicitation requests the entire down-hole packer system/assembly with extra parts and an extra packer bladder.</p>
<p><br />Question 2: If the packer(s) is/are included would this be a single or double packer setup?</p>
<p>Answer:&nbsp;The solicitation requests a packer system that can function both as a single packer system and a double packer system. Please include any extra equipment needed.</p>
<p><br />Question 3: If packers are included, please confirm the size is HQ.<br /><br />Answer:&nbsp;The solicitation requests HQ size packers.</p>
<p>Question 4: If a double packer setup is needed, do you need the perforated pipe section between them? If yes, how long?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes please include a 10-foot-long perforated pipe segment. <br /><br />* We typically conduct tests in 10-foot-length/depth intervals. The packers actually seat some distance above and below the connection of the perforated pipe leading to the test interval being more like 11 feet. This is OK and we currently have no problem modelling / evaluating data the with odd length test interval. If you have an "off the shelf" perforated pipe section (less than 10 ft) that makes the test interval closer to 10 feet, please include that length in your response to the solicitation.<br /><br />********************************************************************</p>

The Contractor shall incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts.<br />(13) These security requirements apply to all sections of this Contract including Contract Drawings and other Contract Specifications as applicable. Related documents include other general provisions of Construction or Operations and Maintenance type Contracts, including FAR clauses by reference or as amended by related documents.<br />(b) Information Security Requirements.<br />(1) Sensitive Information. The term "sensitive information" means any information which warrants a degree of protection and administrative control as defined by Reclamation or that meets the criteria for exemption from public disclosure set forth under Sections 552 and 552a of Title 5, United States Code: the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. Sensitive information is generally categorized as FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information or CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION (CUI), but in some cases may include other unclassified information. (The protection of National Security information is beyond the scope of this clause. If any work on National Security information is required under this contract, it is addressed under other contract clauses.) The Contractor shall protect this type of information from unauthorized release into public domain, or to unauthorized persons, organizations, or subcontractors. Information which, either alone or in aggregate, is deemed sensitive by Reclamation shall be handled and protected in accordance with Reclamation directives and standards for identifying and safeguarding sensitive information (SLE 02-01), which is available from the COR or at http://www.usbr.gov/recman/DandS.html#sle.<br />(i) Any Government-furnished information or material does not become the property of the Contractor and may be withdrawn at any time. Upon expiration or termination of the contract, all documents released to the Contractor and any material created using data from such documents shall be returned to the COR for final disposition. Government-furnished information residing on any electronic systems (laptops, servers, desktops, media) shall be deleted from those systems using a COR-approved data erasure solution. Only with prior authorization from the CO may the Contractor retain the material. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not disclose or release the materials provided to the Contractor to any individuals of the Contractor's organization not directly engaged in providing services under the contract or that do not have a valid need-to-know. All technical data provided to the Contractor by the Government shall be protected from public or private disclosure in accordance with the markings printed on them. All other information relating to the items to be delivered or the services to be performed under this contract shall not be disclosed by any means without prior approval of the CO. Prohibited dissemination or disclosure includes, but is not limited to: permitting access to such information by foreign nationals or by immigrant aliens who may be employed by the Contractor, publication of technical or scientific papers, advertising, disclosure to Contractor staff not investigated and deemed acceptable at the appropriate information sensitivity level, and any other public release. The Contractor shall maintain, and furnish upon request of the CO, records of the names of individuals who have access to sensitive material in its custody. All questions regarding information security, access, and control shall be referred to the COR.<br />(ii) The Contractor shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor's organization any sensitive, or otherwise protected information, regardless of medium in which it is contained (for example, film, tape, document, electronic), pertaining to any part of this contract or any Reclamation program or activity, unless the CO has given prior written approval. This includes, but is not limited to, news releases, marketing promotions, articles, interviews, reports, social media posts, and any other media releases. Requests for approval shall identify the specific information to be released, the medium to be used, the purpose for the release, and a description of the need-to-know. The Contractor shall submit its request to the CO ten business days before the proposed date for release. Subcontractors shall submit requests for authorization to release through the prime Contractor to the CO.<br />(iii) The Contractor shall notify the COR immediately when known or suspected loss/compromise of sensitive information or other documents, notes, drawings, sketches, reports, photographs, exposed film or similar information which may affect the security interests of Government has occurred. This requirement extends to employees and other personnel working on behalf of the Contractor, and expands responsibility to include prompt reporting of security issues, including observed or subsequently discovered efforts by unauthorized persons to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.<br />(2) Classified Information.<br />(i) The disclosure of U.S. Government documents by third parties can result in damage to our national security. While this contract may not deal directly with classified information, each contractor is obligated to protect classified information pursuant to all applicable laws and to use Government information technology systems in accordance with agency procedures so that the integrity of such systems is not compromised. <br />(ii) Unauthorized disclosures of classified documents (whether in print, on a blog, or on websites, or other electronic or non-electronic media) do not alter the documents' classified status or automatically result in declassification of the documents. To the contrary, classified information, whether or not already posted on public websites or disclosed to the media, remains classified, and must be treated as such by Federal employees and contractors, until it is declassified by an appropriate U.S. Government authority. Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information (December 29, 2009), Section 1.1.(c) states, 'Classified Information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information.' Although the Department has taken steps to prevent access to publicly disclosed classified materials from Departmental computers, it is important to understand our continuing duties and responsibilities in this regard.<br />(iii) Contractors (which include all employees of the contractor, as well as subcontractors and its employees performing work for the contractor) are reminded of the following obligations with respect to the treatment of classified information and the use of unclassified government information technology systems: <br />(v) For contracts that require access to classified information, the contractor is responsible for obtaining the required national security clearance through the Department of the Defense National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). Any classified contracts will be coordinated through the Reclamation Chief Security Officer, or for IT requirements, the Bureau Chief Information Security Officer. No contractor shall access classified information unless proper clearances have been obtained and transmitted to Reclamation. For further information, refer to 443 DM 1 or DOD NISPOM 5220.22-M dated February 28, 2006 (incorporating change 2 dated May 18, 2016). \<br />(vi) Classified information shall not be removed from official premises.<br />(vii) Classified information shall not be disclosed without proper authorization.<br />(c) Contractor Employee Suitability and Issuance of Government Identification Cards:<br />(1) Performance of this contract requires Contractor personnel to have a Federal Government-issued HSPD-12/FIPS-201-1 compliant Personal Identification Verification Card (PIV Card) before being allowed unsupervised access to a Federally-controlled facility or information system. An active PIV Card issued by another Federal Government agency will be accepted by Reclamation if the associated background investigation is sufficient for the work and access to facilities and information systems required under this contract, as determined solely by Reclamation. Physical access means routine, unescorted or unmonitored access to non-public areas of a Federally-controlled facility. Logical access means routine, unsupervised access to a Level 3 or 4 Federally controlled information system. <br />(2) At the Government's sole discretion, the Government may issue a temporary identification card or visitor identification badge, in lieu of a PIV Card, under one of the following conditions:<br />(i) The individual will only be associated with Reclamation for a period of 180 days or less, will not have access to sensitive information, and any access to a sensitive area or Federal-controlled information systems will be fully supervised. The 180 calendar day period begins on the first day of the individual's affiliation with Reclamation (in this case, the date that the individual's contract performance begins) and ends exactly 180 days later, regardless of the number of times the individual actually accesses a Government facility or information system. <br />(ii) The individual will only have sporadic access to Federal facilities and information systems; will not have access to sensitive information; and, any access to a sensitive area or Federal-controlled information system will be fully supervised.<br />(iii) The individual will work exclusively outdoors, will not have access to sensitive information, and any access to a sensitive area or Federal-controlled information system will be fully supervised.<br />(iv) In paragraphs (i) through (iii), supervised access means the individual's access to, and movement within, a facility is monitored and controlled sufficiently to prevent access to any unauthorized areas, equipment, or information; and the individual's access to an information system is monitored and controlled sufficiently to ensure appropriate use of the system and information, and to prevent access to any unauthorized systems or information. Supervision must be performed by an individual with an active Government-issued PIV Card.<br />(3) The Contractor shall furnish to the COR an alphabetical list of contract personnel, to include subcontractors, who will require access to a Government facility or information system. The list shall provide the full name, social security number, date of birth, place of birth, purpose or job title, and the estimated duration of access. If the Contractor believes an individual should be issued a temporary identification card or visitor identification badge in lieu of a PIV Card based on the conditions in paragraph (4), then the Contractor must also submit a sufficient written justification as to why the specific individual or individuals will not need a PIV Card. The Contractor shall provide this information before the start of contract performance, or before the start of an individual's performance when there is a change or addition of personnel, with sufficient time to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes.<br />(4) Any contract employees that will be issued a temporary identification card or visitor identification badge, in lieu of a PIV Card, at the Government's sole discretion, will be subject to the following credentialing procedures:<br /><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[All Contractor Personnel Shall Have valid Picture Identification]<br /></span></em>(5) Any contract employees that will be issued a PIV Card will be subject to the following credentialing procedures:<br />(i) The Government will initiate the e-Qip electronic background investigation process, and give the Contractor instructions for completing the background investigation and PIV Card process. As part of the PIV Card process, each Contractor employee shall be required to appear in person at a Government PIV Enrollment Station to have personal identity verification documents verified, have a photograph taken, be fingerprinted, and to pick up and activate the PIV Card when completed. The Contractor must make its personnel available at the place and time specified by the COR in order to initiate this process.<br />(ii) At least two weeks before start of contract performance, the Contractor must identify all contractor and subcontractor personnel who will require (insert as appropriate physical and/or logical) access for performance of work under this contract. The Contractor must make their personnel available at the place and time specified by the COR or DOI Access Card Sponsor in order to initiate screening and background investigations. The following electronic forms, or their equivalent, shall be used to initiate the credentialing process:<br /><br />(a) OPM Standard Form 85 or 85P<br /><br />(b) OF 306<br /><br />(c) Release to Obtain Credit Information<br /><br />(d) Fingerprint Card FD-258 or electronic fingerprints (local procedures may require the fingerprinting to be done at a police station; in this case, any charges are to be borne by the Contractor).<br /><br />(iii) The cost of completing the above processes and submitting the above forms, including any charges for obtaining fingerprints and traveling to a Credentialing Center for card enrollment and activation, shall be borne by the Contractor. The cost of suitability and PIV-related background investigations shall be borne by Reclamation. For contracts that require a national security clearance, the cost of obtaining the national security clearance, including any associated background investigation, will be borne by the Contractor. <br />(iv) Contractor employees are required to complete all forms and to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination. Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials. Government personnel may contact the Contractor personnel being investigated in person, by telephone, or in writing, and the Contractor agrees to make them available for such contact.<br />(v) For each Contractor employee that will be issued a PIV Card, the Government will conduct a background investigation. The tier level of background investigation for each Contractor employee will be determined by the Government based on the risk and sensitivity levels as described in Reclamation's "Personnel Security and Suitability Directives and Standards," SLE 01-01, which is available at http://www.usbr.gov/recman/DandS.html#sle. At a minimum, each Contractor employee that will be issued a PIV Card will receive a Tier 1 [previously a National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI)] Background Investigation. The minimum standards which will be used in suitability determinations are contained in the DOI Departmental Manual Part 441, Chapter 5, which is available at http://elips.doi.gov/ELIPS/DocView.aspx?id=3858.<br />(vi) Each Contractor employee in a position designated as higher than Low Risk Non-Sensitive shall be reinvestigated on a periodic basis as described in Reclamation's Personnel Security and Suitability Directives and Standards. A reinvestigation may also be initiated when the Contractor or the Government believes that a particular individual's continued ability to meet the contract's minimum standards is in question; or if it is determined that the position has changed and a higher level investigation is warranted.<br />(vii) If a Contractor employee has worked under a Federal agency contract within the past two years, and that contract required a successfully-adjudicated background investigation at the same risk level as (or higher than) this contract, further investigation may not be necessary. The Contractor shall provide the COR with documentation that supports the individual's previous contract work and any information, including name and social security number, date of birth, and place of birth, needed for Government verification of previous background investigation. <br />(viii) Contractor employees who have been successfully adjudicated will be issued DOI Access Cards, which must be activated at a USAccess Credentialing Center.<br />(ix) If the final adjudication is unfavorable on a Contractor employee, or if Reclamation finds a Contractor employee to be unsuitable or unfit for his or her assigned duties, the CO will direct the Contractor to remove the individual from the contract and access to the Federal facility at which the contract activities are occurring. In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the Government concerning the suitability of a particular employee to perform work under this contract, the Government shall have the right of final determination. Determinations under this requirement are subject to the Disputes Clause. Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this clause could constitute grounds for termination for default.<br />(x) Reclamation will not allow a Contractor employee access to their investigation files. An individual may request, under the provisions of the Privacy Act and/or Freedom of Information Act, copies of their files from the investigative agency (Office of Personnel Management). Reclamation will not release a copy of any investigative file, in whole or part, to the Contractor or any Contractor representative.<br />(xi) During performance of the contract, the Contractor must keep the COR apprised of changes in personnel to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes. Cards that have been lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COR and Issuing Office within 24 hours. If reissuance of expired credentials is needed, it must be coordinated through the COR.<br />(xii) At the end of the contract performance, or when a contractor employee is no longer working under this contract, the Contractor must ensure that all identification cards are returned to the COR.<br /><br />(d) Vessel Exclusion Barriers<br /><br />(1) Proof of Certification. The contractor shall, for any vessel exclusion barrier proposed for supply and/or installation under this contract, provide the contracting officer with proof of certification in accordance with ASTM Standard F2766-11 - Standard Test Method for Boat Barriers. This proof of certification shall be provided to the contracting officer as part of any contractor proposal for the supply and/or installation of any boat barrier proposed under this contract.<br />(e) Site Security Requirements<br />(1) General Description. This section provides provisions to ensure the full security integrity of the facility and personnel working at the facility. The work of this section may involve interfaces with a number of Government security personnel, normally coordinated through the designated COR. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that activities are accomplished in a manner that complies fully with applicable security statutes, regulations, policies, directives, and standards.<br />(2) Government Security Personnel. When and where applicable, personnel may be assigned to control access, secure materials or activities at the work site, or escort Contractor personnel in sensitive areas. Personnel may include: security managers, security guards, security contractors acting as agents of the Government, law enforcement personnel, or other contractors or employees. These individuals may be used to ensure the overall security and integrity of the site or building and provide controlled access. These individuals may conduct inspections of all workers, vehicles, equipment, or materials entering, or re-entering the work site. The inspection may be done visually, with walk-through and/or hand-held metal detectors, or by other means as may be deemed necessary by Reclamation. <br />(3) Contractor Guard Force. At the Contractor's sole discretion, and at the Contractor's own expense, with prior written Government approval, a Contractor may be authorized to hire its own guards to secure Contractor-owned equipment and/or to protect Contractor employees or subcontractors. If such a relationship is permitted, the Contractor shall be exclusively liable for all guard activities to include action or inaction of Contractor's guard personnel. The Government will not offer nor provide any indemnification. Contractor shall be solely responsible for guards at all times to include any supervision, oversight, and for the development of local guard orders and/or procedures. The Contractor shall be responsible for coordinating all guard activities with the COR and shall develop and submit to the COR, for advance approval, any guard orders and/or guard procedures.<br />(4) Additional Security-Related Submittals<br />(i) Visitor List. The Contractor shall furnish to the COR, in advance, notification of visit of any Contractor-sponsored visitor to a Government-controlled facility.

The Contractor shall comply with the Government's site security procedures as specified, and as requested subsequent to award of Contract. Failure of the Contractor to comply with required access controls, information handling procedures, or any other security controls or procedures, may result in revocation of Contractor personnel access to the work site. The Government reserves the right to modify or clarify security provisions of this contract based on changing political and civil circumstances, and perceived threats to personnel or the facility. <br />(ii) Security Facilities and Equipment. The Contractor shall use security facilities and equipment only for the purposes intended and as directed by the CO. The Contractor shall comply with the Government's instructions for use of secure storage areas, site enclosure and gates, temporary security lighting, building space enclosure, and lockup devices and systems established for detection, monitoring, signaling, and alarming field office facilities. Measures necessary to secure the integrity of materials, equipment, and tools installed or used in furtherance of this contract shall be at no cost to the Government.<br />(iii) Security Personnel Availability/Work Schedules. The Contractor shall notify the COR at least 24 hours in advance of any projected work which might impact on security or require the scheduling of extended security personnel support. The Contractor shall provide a weekly work schedule, such as anticipated delivery of materials, use of explosives or heavy machinery, and extra time needed for continuous or inherently lengthy construction or project specific operations (such as concrete placement). <br />(iv) Deliveries. The Contractor shall provide at least one day's advance notice of major deliveries, including time of arrival and trucks/carriers/documentation to be expected for arrival at work site. The Contractor shall provide reasonable advanced notice of deliveries which must be accommodated/accepted at times other than the Government's established working hours. Failure to provide adequate advanced notice may result in delivery delays at the Contractor's expense.<br />(v) Site Access. All Contractor personnel will be issued appropriate identification and must comply with all local access control procedures. The Government reserves the exclusive right to refuse or disallow any vehicular or pedestrian access to any Government-controlled facility or for any deliveries to the work site, regardless if access was scheduled or unscheduled.<br />(vi) Inspections and Searches. The Government reserves unqualified and unlimited right at any time to conduct security-related inspections or searches of work, material, equipment, personnel, and temporary facilities at the work site. The Contractor shall afford unrestricted access to work and allow surveillance and inspection by any Government personnel as authorized by the COR. The Government reserves the right to conduct searches of articles and personal effects of all Contractor personnel, both at point of entry and exit from the work site or Government facility. All Contractor personnel entering and leaving the work site may be required to pass through a Walk-Through-Metal-Detector device and/or other detection devices.<br />(vii) After Duty Hours. No Contractor personnel shall be permitted access to the work site after the Government's established working hours without prior authorization from the Government. All personnel seeking access to the site after the Government's established working hours may be required to sign in and out in a visitor's log that may be maintained by the on duty security personnel (if any).<br />(viii) Access Procedures at Sensitive Areas. In some instances, the Contractor may be required to erect temporary security barriers and doors to isolate a sensitive area as instructed by the Government. The Contractor may be required to install locks and thereafter control access. The Contractor shall comply with the Government's requirement for limited and escorted access to the sensitive area. The Contractor shall notify the COR at least one day prior to each requested access to the sensitive area that is outside of the Government's established working hours.<br />(ix) Reported Violations.

Required briefings may include, but are not limited to, the following: Information Security, Site Security Requirements and Procedures, Delivery Methods and Inspections, Storage Requirements, Reporting Requirements, Supervisory Procedures, Contractor Employee Conduct, Visitor Control, and Threats.<br />(xi) Key Control. Control of keys/access codes and lock combinations is essential for the Government's project security. The Contractor shall not allow keys or access codes to be duplicated or removed from the work site, nor allow lock combinations to be divulged without specific written advanced authorization from the COR. Such loss of control, observed or suspected, may result in a requirement to change locks involved at the Contractor's expense. At the direction of the COR, the Contractor shall provide duplicate keys and lock combinations to Government security personnel when requested for the purpose of security inspections and emergency actions, including keys, combinations, and access codes needed for unrestricted access to every area and element of the project. The Contractor may be required to establish a key control program that is acceptable to the Government for Government-issued keys and for heavy machinery parked at the construction site (if this is a construction contract). <br />(xii) Vehicle Control. In general, parking of vehicles on the work site shall not be permitted, except for tractors, cranes, and similar equipment used directly in performance of work, for delivery of materials/supplies, and for removal of waste and surplus material. The Government may designate an approved contractor employee parking area. Upon entering the work site, vehicles and drivers may be subject to search and inspection. The Contractor shall obtain authorization from the COR to park the Contractor's official vehicles and motorized vehicular construction equipment that are required/desired to be parked on the work site. Vehicles in violation may be towed off the work site at the Contractor's expense. Where Government-designated employee parking is not available, parking of construction employees' automobiles and similar transportation vehicles may be excluded from the work site. It is the Contractor's responsibility to arrange for suitable accommodation for these vehicles.<br />(xiii) Prohibited/Restricted Items. Prohibited/restricted items and activities on the work site include but are not limited to the following: firearms and other weapons, except as specifically authorized by the COR in compliance with state and Federal laws and regulations; drugs, including narcotics, barbiturates, marijuana, alcoholic beverages, and similar substances, except for use with valid medical prescription; and explosives. <br />(xiv) Exceptions for Explosives. When needed for use in specifically limited amounts and controlled circumstances for construction work, explosives may be brought onsite with written prior authorization from the COR. As a hazardous material, the Contractor shall treat the use of explosives in accordance with regulations and guidance provided by Federal, State, and local authorities. The storage of explosives shall be in accordance with requirements of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms or the State in which they are stored. If onsite storage of explosives is necessary, explosives shall be stored at a pre-designated, secure site approved by the COR. Prior to Government approval of storage, the Contractor shall develop and submit to the COR a complete storage/security/retrieval plan for approval. The storage/security plan can be included in a "Blasting Safety Plan." The plan shall make accommodations for surveillance, detection, and response. Explosives firing systems shall be stored off-site and under no circumstances shall be stored together with explosives. <br />(xv) Photography. The use of photographic equipment and taking of photographs shall only be allowed as authorized by the COR. <br /><br />(f) Information Technology Security - Basic Security Requirements:<br />(1) The Contractor shall ensure that its employees, in performance of the contract, receive annual IT security training in Reclamation IT Security policies, procedures, computer ethics, and best practices in accordance with Reclamation Directive IRM 08-09, September 21, 2001, Subject: Reclamation Information Technology (IT) Security Program (ITSP): IT Security Awareness and Training Requirements.

However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error.<br />(End Provision)</p>

<p>(2) Specific Instructions. Quotes shall consist of three parts, as identified below.</p>
<p>(a) PRICE QUOTATION. Submit the price quote in accordance with the line item structure listed in this solicitation. Price quotes must be firm-fixed price. Price quotes must include unit prices and extended amounts for each line item (i.e., multiply the unit price and quantity for each line item).

<p>(b) DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE.

<p>(ii) Quotes must include a completed copy of the following provisions that require fill-in text (listed in attachment #1 of this solicitation):</p>
<p>&bull; FAR 52.212-3 ("The Offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically in the System for Award Management (SAM) accessed through https://www.sam.gov.

<p>3. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Oct 2014), and the addenda listed below applies to this acquisition. The evaluation factors to be included in paragraph (a) of this provision are Price, Technical Information, and Past Performance (see attachment #1) for the full text of this provision).</p>
<p>ADDENDA TO FAR 52.212-2:</p>
<p>BASIS FOR OFFER. This is a competitive acquisition in accordance with FAR part 12 and part 13. The Government will submit an offer in the form of a purchase order to the quoter that represents the best value to the Government. Quotes will be evaluated as described below.</p>
<p>(1) Solicitation Requirements. All quotes submitted will be reviewed for completeness to determine if they contain all information requested in the addenda to FAR 52.212-1. Quotes that are incomplete or missing information may be considered non-responsive and excluded from the evaluation.</p>
<p>(2) Price Evaluation. The total evaluated price will be determined by adding together the extended amounts quoted for each line item. The extended amounts will be confirmed by multiplying each line item quantity by the quoted unit price. If there is a conflict between the quoted unit prices and extended amounts, the unit price shall be used to determine the total evaluated price. Any discounts identified in the quote will be included in the evaluation of the total evaluated price. No advantage will accrue to a vendor who submits a quote for an unreasonably low price. The lowest price quote may not necessarily be selected. Failure to propose for any line item may cause the vendor's quote may be considered non-responsive and excluded from the evaluation. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness of the quoted price.</p>
<p>(3) Technical Evaluation. The evaluation team will review the descriptive literature to determine if quoted product(s) meet the salient characteristics identified in this solicitation. The technical information will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.</p>
<p>(4) Past Performance Evaluation. The past performance evaluation will be based on the contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supplies being acquired and in accordance with DFARS 252.213-7000, Notice to Prospective Suppliers on Use of Supplier Performance Risk System in Past Performance Evaluations (Mar 2018). A quoter will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably if they do not have a record of past performance in SPRS under the PSC of the items being purchased.</p>
<p>(5) Best Value Decision. The contracting officer shall evaluate quotes considering technical information, price, and past performance information. The contracting officer will submit an offer to the quoter whose quote represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>4. The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Oct 2018), and the addenda listed below applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>ADDENDA TO FAR 52.212-4:</p>
<p>Text in paragraph (c) is deleted and replaced with the following:</p>
<p>(c) Changes. Changes in terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties with the exception of certain changes such as administrative changes including changes in paying office, appropriation data, etc. authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulation and its supplements that may be made unilaterally by the Contracting Officer (for a complete list of changes that may be made unilaterally, see FAR 43.103(b)).</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be

match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,

level possible before considering the more formal process described below.

Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p><strong>Submission Information</strong></p>
<p>Quotes must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ and signed by an official authorized to bind your organization. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt thereof by the Government.</p>
<p>This solicitation does not commit the Government to pay any of the costs associated with the preparation and submission of your quote. In addition, the Contracting Officer is the only individual authorized to legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this requirement. By submitting a quote in response to this solicitation, it is understood that your quote shall become a part of the official contract file.</p>
<p>The quote must be prepared in three SEPARATE volumes: Volume I - "Technical", Volume II - "Past Performance" and Volume III - "Price/Business". Each of these parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that the evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of the evaluation of the other. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number should be included on the front cover of each volume.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Volume (Volume I)</strong></p>
<p>The technical volume shall be limited to 10 pages, with 1-inch margins, and using not less than 12-point font. Respondents are encouraged to be succinct and economical in their presentation. Excessive volume and elaborate presentation are unnecessary. Tables of contents, works cited, and the Technical Appendix are not included in the page count. <br /><br />The technical volume must not contain references to price; however, resource information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, etc., must be contained in the technical volume so that the Respondent's understanding of the scope of work may be evaluated. Quoters must provide clear responses, including objectives and outcomes, to each task addressing the work to be performed in the SOW. The technical volume must reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work being undertaken. Quotes which merely offer to conduct a project in accordance with the Government's requirements will not be eligible for award.</p>
<p><strong>Past Performance Volume (Volume II)</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall identify two (2) contracts/task orders with the Federal Government and/or commercial customers that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance. Recent is defined as within the last three years. Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude of the work described in this SOW.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Include the following information for each contract or subcontract: <br /><br />1. Name of Contracting Organization <br />2. Contract Number <br />3. Contract Type <br />4. Total Contract Value <br />5. Description of Requirement <br />6. Contracting Officer's Name and Telephone Number <br />7. Program Manager's Name and Telephone Number</p>
<p>The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.</p>
<p><strong>Price/Business Volume Instructions (Volume III)</strong><br /><br />Quoters shall prepare a price volume that contains all information necessary to allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the prices quoted.</p>
<p>The price quote must contain the following information:</p>
<p>1. Cover letter which includes the following:<br />a. Federal Tax Identification Number (TIN);<br />b. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number;<br />c. Business Size (e.g., small or large);</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation and award will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of <strong>FAR 13.106</strong>. The Government does not anticipate requesting revisions to quotes, so Quoters should provide their best solution and price in response to the RFQ. However, the Government reserves the right to request quote revisions that seek additional price discounts, provide revisions to the technical quote, or clarify aspects of the quote. In the event quote revisions are requested, the Government will not necessarily be seeking revisions from all Quoters. The Government <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will not</span></strong> be conducting "discussions" as defined in FAR Part 15.</p>
<p><strong>Basis for Award</strong></p>
<p>The Government will issue one award resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Contractor whose quote conforming to the quotation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government shall evaluate the following factors in order of importance: technical (technical approach and personnel qualification), past performance and price. When combined, all evaluation factors other than price will be considered significantly more important than price. As quotes become more equal under the non-price factors, the importance of price increases.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Factors</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. TECHNICAL FACTOR</strong></p>
<p>a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Approach:</span> The Quoter will be evaluated on extent to which it's technical volume demonstrates an understanding of the tasks to be performed and highlights their ability to successfully complete the requirements in the SOW. The vendor shall ensure that it's quote identifies how it's abilities map to the overall needs of the SOW and underscore how it intends to address the tasks in the SOW.</p>
<p>b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personnel Qualification:</span> The vendor should highlight the qualifications of the personnel that will be responsible for conducting the training. The information provided should underline personnel qualifications and specific recent experience with similar project as outlined in SOW. The Quoter will be evaluated on the extent to which it demonstrates that the personnel is qualified and capable of providing the required training as described in the SOW.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Technical Evaluation - Adjectival Ratings</strong></span></p>
<p>Evaluators will apply the criteria of the following adjectives, as general guidance to be used when rating the technical subfactors, and the technical volume ("Volume II") as a whole:</p>
<p><strong>Adjectival Rating Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXCEPTIONAL - </strong>The quote contains no deficiencies or only a very few and very minor weaknesses. Based on information provided, there is no doubt that the quote demonstrates an exceptional understanding of the services required to meet or exceed most requirements. The highest quality of performance is anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>GOOD</strong>&nbsp; - The quote contains no deficiencies and only a few minor weaknesses. Based on the information provided, there is little doubt that the quote demonstrates a high quality of understanding of the services required to meet or exceed some of the requirements.</p>
<p><strong>ACCEPTABLE - </strong>The quote contains no deficiencies and some weaknesses. Based on the information provided, the Quote demonstrates an understanding of the services required to meet the requirements.</p>
<p><strong>MARGINAL</strong> - The quote contains deficiencies and significant weaknesses. Based on information provided, there is doubt that the contractor understands the services required to meet the requirements. Requirement/services can be met only with major changes to the quote.</p>
<p><strong>UNACCEPTABLE - </strong>&nbsp;The quote has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; failure to understand much of the scope of work necessary to perform the requirements; failure to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the government's requirements; failure to meet many personnel requirements in the solicitation. (When applying this adjective to a quote as a whole, the technical quote would have to be so unacceptable in one or more areas that it would have to be completely revised in order to attempt to make it other than unacceptable.)</p>
<p><strong>2. PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR</strong></p>
<p>Past performance information is one indicator of a Quoter's ability to perform the contract successfully. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, content of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance shall be considered. This evaluation is subjective and will be based on information obtained from references provided by the Quoter (for themselves, predecessor companies, key personnel, and major subcontractors). The Government may also consider information obtained through other sources. Past performance information will be utilized to determine the quality of the Contractor's past performance as it relates to the probability of success of the required effort.</p>
<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each Quoter. Performance risks are those associated with a Quoter's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that Quoter's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of a Quoter's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.</p>
<p>The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.</p>
<p>This evaluation criteria will be evaluated as either "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable".</p>
<p><strong>Acceptability Rating Definition</strong> <br /><br /><strong>Acceptable Quotation</strong> - clearly meets the minimum requirements of the RFQ.<br /><strong>Unacceptable Quotation</strong> - does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the RFQ.</p>
<p><strong>3. PRICE FACTOR</strong></p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Quoter's price for all items/services proposed. Quotations will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for the option period to the total price for the basic requirement. To account for the option period possible under 52.217-8 (maximum of six months), Option to Extend Services, the Government will evaluate the option to extend services (FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding 6 months of the Quoter's option period price to the Quoter's total price. This amount will be the total evaluated price.<br /><br /><strong>SUBMISSION INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quotations</span></strong> must be submitted electronically (via email) to Contract Specialist, Kathy Elliott, at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elliottk@mail.nih.gov</span> in MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), no later than 11:00 AM EST, on Thursday, January 24, 2019. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered. QUOTATIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. No collect calls will be accepted.</p>

<DESC><p><br />Sources Sought Synopsis:</p>
<p>Number/Notice Type:<br />FA8206-19-R-00673/Sources Sought</p>
<p><br />Synopsis:</p>
<p>1. NOTICE: THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 811219 which has a corresponding Size standard of $20.5 million dollars. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>2. PROGRAM DETAILS</p>
<p>2.1 The Air Force will issue repair services contract to refurbish components for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Weapon System Flight. Refurbishment will be to the Servovalves used on the Minuteman III stage 1 (P89A1) and Stage 2 (P90A1) flight control units</p>
<p>Components requiring Refurbishment:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM NSN PART NUMBER<br />0001 P-89A1 Stage 1 Servovalve, Model 33-114C 1420-00-973-1170 010-25986<br />0002 P-90A1 Stage 2 Servovalve, Model 50-248G 1420-01-505-2521 021-41878</p>
<p>3. LIMITATIONS</p>
<p>3.1 The Government has limited data rights from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). No drawings or data can be provided to interested vendors without approval from the OEM.</p>
<p>3.2 In addition the Government does not have sufficient data or rights to be able to independently evaluate and qualify potential repair sources to maintain the Servo Injectors Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E). Prior to requesting Government approval, companies interested in becoming an approved Government repair source should first obtain OEM authorization/certification to accomplish refurbishment and testing. If OEM authorization is not received, the company seeking Government source approval will need to clearly identify how the company will overcome the lack of Government data/rights and refurbish the Servo injectors OSS&amp;E in order to potentially allow Government qualification independent of the OEM authorization/certification.</p>
<p><br />4. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>

The goal of the project is to transform the space into a Community Living Center residential ward with private rooms and private bathrooms in a homelike environment, in keeping with the Small House design concept.   
This will be a complete interior gut, abatement, and renovation.  However, no exterior or building envelope work is anticipated, except as needed for minor utility and HVAC connections. Budget for construction is limited and it will be the design s team task to creatively achieve the needed scope.  
The AE shall conduct a survey of the project area to:
Test and locate all asbestos-containing materials. Assume all pipes in all chases are wrapped in ACM insulation. Remediation measures to remove ACM shall be included in the design documents, and it is the intent that no ACM material remains in the renovated spaces.
Verify location of structural and building elements against existing documents and amend as needed prior to start of design.
Verify that the existing medical gas systems are in compliance with NFPA Codes and Standards to insure the new medical gases can be tied into the existing facility system.  Survey results identifying deficiencies w/technical solutions shall be incorporated into the design documents.

















 













Verify existing heating hot water and chilled water supply and return risers up to the fourth floor D-wing are sized adequately to support the new HVAC system for this project as well as incorporate associated technical solutions into the design documents.
 
A second field verification is required following demolition and abatement. Review to include, but not limited to: location and measurement of structural, building elements, utilities existing to remain or to be tied into, other existing elements that have impact on design and were not previously available for inspection. Design documents to be amended as needed and re-issued. 

 
 
A detailed cost estimate performed by a professional cost estimator is required at each design stage in order to ensure the final design estimate does not exceed the funding limit.  It is anticipated that deduct alternates will be included.   

Work requirements include, but are not limited to:
Complete interior demolition of Wing 4D and a part of 4th Floor Core area, including abatement.
Installation of a functional CLC Neighborhood in keeping with the Small House Model, including approximately 12 residential units with individual bathrooms; Kitchen, Dining and Living Rooms; Common and Recreational Areas.  All required nursing and medical support functions to maintain resident s health, safety, and day-to-day homelike living.
New HVAC systems and equipment including both local and BMS controls.  As part of the initial project assessment, provide a recommendation based on a comparison of at least two alternative HVAC system solutions including VAV and/or active chilled beams.  Recommendation will be based on a consideration of installed cost, operating cost, and serviceability of installed equipment.  Each alternative will be presented with: floor plans showing locations of major equipment; 1 line schematic drawings; preliminary equipment schedules; locations of connections to existing HW and CHW mains or risers; analysis of existing HW and CHW capacity for new HVAC system; estimated construction cost; and estimated annual operating cost.
Lighting will be LED with warm spectrum, individually controlled within residences.
Provide Security, Nurse Call, Telecommunications, Patient Safety, and other electrical support systems.
Plumbing to include individual and common bathrooms, utility and nursing sinks, kitchen sinks, HVAC piping.
Fire Protection will be extended from the building sprinkler system, and class 1A fire alarm system.  
Provide structural supports for hospital-selected patient lift systems.


OFFERORS WILL BE EVALUATED ON THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
The submitted SF-330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:

The A/E must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation criteria for all services. Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria (5) and (6) are of slightly less importance than (1) through (4), but are equal value among themselves; Criteria (7) and (8) are the least important and listed in descending order of importance. Specific evaluation criteria include:

1. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required,  including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.
2.  Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.
3.  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.
4.  Past Performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.
5.  Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.
6.  Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.
7.  Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
8.  Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.

Criterion 1 - Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.

Experience with Architectural Design within a Health Care Setting
Experience with Space Planning within a Health Care Setting
Experience with Space Planning within a Health Care Setting
Mechanical and Electrical evaluation within a Health Care Setting. 

Submission requirements: Provide up to five (5) projects completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years that best illustrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above. Example projects shall note project s square footage. All projects provided in the SF-330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and/or perform work under this contract. To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF-330 Part 1, Section F Item 25  Firms from Section C Involved in this Project,  block (1).

If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work they provided towards the performance of the overall project. If a project was performed by a joint venture, and not all joint venture partners are on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract. Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) projects for this criterion. Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project. Instead, list relevant completed task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above. Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.

Good: Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low. 
Acceptable: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate.  
Marginal: Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high. 
Unacceptable: Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is not awardable. The firm s proposal demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement and the approach fails to meet performance standards. The firm s proposal has major omissions and inadequate details to assure evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of requirement.

The ratings identified below will be used in the evaluation of Past Performance (Criterion 4):
Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they can satisfy the requirements of the contract.

<DESC>This is a market survey for (Request 1) the Asbestos Containing Materials (ACM) abatement projects at FAA facilities and also a concurrent request (Request 2) for third party monitoring of these Asbestos Containing Materials (ACM) abatement projects at FAA facilities. The first request (Request 1) is to furnish all labor, equipment, and materials necessary to develop site specific plans, cost estimates, resource requirements, schedules and abatement for asbestos abatement projects at multiple sites. The FAA anticipates to abate asbestos and restore affected surfaces at 39 facilities located across the United States (see attachment) in accordance with attached DRAFT statement of work. The second request (Request 2) will provide monitoring of the abatement projects before, during and after at each anticipated facility as described in the attached DRAFT statement of work.

INTRODUCTION<br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) intends to negotiate and award a contract for one high-throughput flow system (HTFS) capable of exerting physiological shear stresses on human endothelial cell monolayers growing on standard Transwell&reg; inserts in a 96-well plate.</p>
<p>EXTENT OF COMPETITION<br />This acquisition is full and open with no set-aside restrictions.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a Size Standard of 1000 employees.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY<br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC): FAC_2019-01 dated January 22, 2019.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 15-contracting by Negotiations at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($250,000).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT <br />Background<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>The 3-D Tissue Bioprinting Group at NCATS is invested in developing therapeutically relevant three-dimensional tissues for basic research and drug screening. Experts at NCATS are applying the techniques of 3-D printing to develop tissue models that mimic the 3-D structure and organization of cells in the tissues of living organisms. To achieve therapeutic relevance, certain projects must incorporate mechanical cues to create a physiologically relevant cell environment. The incorporation of shear stress is important for vascular projects, as cell function is influenced by mechanical cues, and the Transwell&reg; system is positioned to enable research on many such vascular environments, such as the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain a commercially available (with or without modificaitosn) high-throughput flow system (HTFS) capable of exerting physiological shear stresses on human endothelial cell monolayers that are growing on standard Transwell&reg; inserts in a 96-well plate and cultured with astrocytes on opposites sides of a membrane which mimic a blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Project Requirements <br />The Government seeks to acquire a HTFS for a standard 96-well plate format that utilizes cone-and-plate shear to create adjustable shear stresses with hemodynamic waveforms in each well.  The system shall be compatible with existing cell culture laboratory incubators, allowing for temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide control.  The system shall contain 8 motors, so that shear stress can be controlled independently in groupings of 12 wells within a single plate.<br /> <br />The following project specification are deemed essential to this acquisition.  The system must:</p>
<p>(1)	Apply adjustable shear stresses and hemodynamic waveforms to endothelial cell monolayers growing on standard Transwell&reg; inserts in a 96-well place;</p>
<p>(2)	Apply shear stress in a manner that does not decrease the viability of cells in the monolayer;<br /> <br />(3)	Be compatible with standard 96-well plate format;</p>
<p>(4)	Fit into a standard culture incubator, with electronics and hardware reliable for extended (1 week) operation without corrosion or other failure modes;</p>
<p>(5)	Control mechanical cues independently between group of 12 wells in a single plate;</p>
<p>(6)	Allow for easy access to tissue on both sides of membrane for media changes and imaging during culture period;</p>
<p>(7)	Maintain temperature stability in incubator of +/- 1&deg;C;</p>
<p>(8)	Produce shear stress control of +/- 2dyn/cm2 estimated from modeling and geometric/motor waveform measurements and spot-checked in the system.</p>
<p>Delivery<br />Delivery is expected within 10-12 months ARO.</p>
<p>CLOSING STATEMENT<br />The solicitation will be issued on or about Febraury 7, 2019 and bids or proposals will be tentatively due about 30 days after the solicitation release date.</p>
<p>Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from the Contract Specialist, Hunter Tjugum, electronically at hunter.tjugum@nih.gov. Please reference the solicitation on your electronic request.</p>

<DESC><div>This notice is amended to document the change in the estimated Award budget.</div>
<p>The award is anticipated to be for a cost plus fixed Fee completion type contract for a period not to exceed five years with an estimated budget not exceeding $15,000,000</p>
<div>_________________________________________________________________</div>
<div>Subject to the availability of funds, USAID/Azerbaijan intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) on/or about March 1, 2019 for the Private Sector Activity in Azerbaijan. The award is anticipated to be for a cost plus fixed Fee completion type contract for a period not to exceed five years with an estimated budget not exceeding $15,000,000.</div>
<p>The goal of this Activity is to utilize a partnership and co-investment approach to support a more resilient Azerbaijan economy, beyond the oil sector, by improving the competitiveness of the private sector with a special focus on agriculture and reducing the administrative barriers that hinder the development of micro, small, and medium enterprises in Azerbaijan. Modernization and improvement of the public sectors in order to support the diversification of Azerbaijan's economy requires a strong set of public institutions with clarity of roles and responsibilities. These institutions require capacity to carry out their often new roles and adjust to institutional change as the suite of reforms called for in the Roadmap of Strategic Reforms unfolds. It is also crucial to have a private sector that is capable of and poised to respond to improvements in the business enabling environment. As such, the objectives of this activity are:<br /> <br />1.More diversified non-oil economy through initiatives that assist small and medium sized agribusinesses and&nbsp; farmers to grow;</p>
<p>2.Improved business environment for micro, small and medium businesses; and&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Support for Azerbaijan's economic reforms</p>
<p>This is NOT an invitation for a Request for Proposal (RFP) and in no way obligates the US Government to issue an RFP and/or award a contract. The information herein is released for wide dissemination to all parties and is indicative only. The information is subject to modification and is in no way binding to government and the estimate is based on the best information available at this time.</p>

The concrete sill was constructed on top of rock at approximately -52 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). The crest elevation of the concrete sill is -37.6 feet MLLW. A substantial portion of the concrete sill is to be removed (9.4 feet) resulting in a maximum crest elevation of -47 feet MLLW. Sediments may need to be cleared around the concrete sill to allow access to the structure, and this material may be disposed in the Dayson Island (D/A-D) Dredge Material Placement Facility (DMPF) which is approximately 2.7 miles from the concrete sill location or in another manner in accordance with the Specifications. All concrete and reinforcement bars from the concrete sill and any insitu rock removed from the slipway shall be disposed of at on off-site location and shall not be placed into D/A-D. Safe navigation in and out of MCSF-BI shall be maintained throughout removal of the concrete sill operations. The Contractor shall use a diamond wire saw to cut out the submerged concrete sill.

<DESC>The work includes removing an existing Herbert Hoover Dike Culvert HP-5 and the construction of new water control structure S-284 within the same footprint as the existing structure. The new construction of S-284 will require the installation of a steel sheet pile cofferdam with earthen plugs on the lakeside and an earthen cofferdam on the landside. These features are required to excavate, remove the existing structure, and construct the new S-284. The landside cofferdam will also serve as a bypass road for the Contractor, Government, Seminole Tribe of Florida (STOF), and State personnel and other construction Contractors (construction equipment) not associated with this contract. Dewatering will be required to control the groundwater in accordance with contract specifications. The structure will include cast-in-place reinforced concrete foundations, headwalls, and culvert. A combination flap/slide gate will be installed at the lakeside headwall. S-284 will consist of one (1) 8-foot by 8-foot culvert. In addition to the 8-foot by 8-foot culvert, a 42-inch conduit will be installed through the embankment just south of the S-284 structure for future pumped water supply. The pumps and infrastructure will be installed under a separate contract. Once the embankment is constructed to the lines and grades shown, riprap will be installed as shown, and a control building will be installed on the work platform. Work also includes operation of the by-pass pump system, grassing and turbidity monitoring. After completion of S-284 construction, the steel sheet pile and earthen cofferdams will be removed. The period of performance for this procurement is a total of 869 calendar days plus 90 calendars to establish grass and sodding from issuance of the Notice to Proceed.

There are two pump-stations which will require the discharge pipes to be raised. Installation of a landside maintenance road is also required. The cutoff wall construction may be performed by applying either the vertical chain trenching (also known as One Pass Trenching (OPT)) or open trench (conventional long-stick) method.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In accordance with the DFAR 236.204(ii), the magnitude disclosure of this construction project is between $25M and $100M. This proposed contract action will be conducted using FSC Code: Y1LC and NAICS: 237990.</div>

However, all responses received before the closing date of this announcement <br />will be considered by the Government.
