<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK 
 OPHTHALMIC DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  
MICHAEL E. DEBAKEY VA MEDICAL CENTER, HOUSTON, TEXAS

PURPOSE 

The overall purpose is to procure a comprehensive, integrated ophthalmic data management system for the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC) located at 2002 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, Texas 77030 and eye clinics located at the MEDVAMC s community based outpatient clinics located in the following Texas cities: Beaumont, Lufkin, Katy, Richmond, Texas City, Conroe and Tomball. The system must interface with the MEDVAMCs electronic medical record and existing eye equipment enabling consolidated storage, transfer, review and analysis of eye tests and exams conducted at any of the above-listed sites. The Contractor shall provide all necessary tools, interfaces, equipment/hardware, software, licenses, delivery, installation, warranty, and training.    

BACKGROUND

The MEDVAMC and its community satellite outpatient clinics have many and varied eye testing and exam systems. At present, these systems operate independently and very few are interfaced with the facility s electronic medical record. Test and exam data is routinely printed and then scanned into the medical record, a very labor intensive system that yields less than optimal image quality after scanning. Furthermore, accessing the scanned data is cumbersome for the eye physicians. This request is to acquire a data management system that will integrate eye data from these systems, store the information, and transfer it to the MEDVAMC electronic medical record. The system should also facilitate review of the data by eye care providers for treatment decision making purposes. 

SCOPE

The goal is to have the same vendor supply, install, and train staff on the use of eye data management system at the MEDVAMC as well as its community based outpatient clinics.

This requirement is being competed as a total small business set-aside.<br />***The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase ** One (1) Prism Coupler for measuring optical properties of thin films.
<p><br />BACKGROUND OF PROPOSED ACQUISITION: <br />Divisions 686, 687, and 688 develop new materials for use in photonics. The optical properties (real and imaginary components of the refractive index) must be accurately measured so that we can understand if the devices that we build from these films are performing as designed and modeled. It is especially important to be able to measure very small values of the imaginary component of the refractive index as this corresponds to optical loss in the device and is known to be a limiting factor in determining device performance.<br />DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE OF ITEM/SERVICE TO BE ACQUIRED:<br />The proposed acquisition is for the purchase of a Prism Coupler. A Prism Coupler is used for measuring the refractive indices (real and imaginary) of thin films at various wavelengths. The wavelengths are determined by the available laser wavelengths that are coupled to the system. Prism Couplers are the most sensitive instruments for measuring the imaginary part of the refractive index, which corresponds to the optical loss of the film. Accurate measurements of these values are critical to designing and modeling optical devices of interest to NIST.</p>
<p>Specifications<br />Minimum Specifications<br />1. Wavelength/Beamlines: 632, 1064, 1550 nm, plus one external port for arbitrary wavelength input<br />2. Refractive index measurement range: 1.8 - 2.4 and 3 - 3.35, based on two prisms<br />3. Propagation loss measurement range: 0.1 - 15 dB/cm <br />4. Refractive index precision: +/- 0.005 RIU nominal<br />5. Detector: Germanium (or sensitive up to 1700 nm wavelength)<br />6. Polarization: TE polarization only required<br />7. Capability of measuring waveguide loss</p>
<p>Delivery<br />The contractor must deliver a Prism Coupler meeting all of the above specifications no later than 12 weeks after award date. Delivery is FOB Destination.<br />Installation<br />The Prism Coupler must be installed by the contractor no later than 2 weeks after it arrives at NIST. The Prism Coupler must be installed in the purchaser's clean room.<br />Testing and Acceptance<br />Testing and acceptance will take place no later than 5 days after installation.<br />Warranty<br />A warranty of 12 months must be included. Warranty repairs shall include all parts, labor, and travel.<br />Delivery<br />Delivery shall be FOB Destination.<br />FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) Office, Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA or BIE does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIE Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIE if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

Vendors should plan to arrive to the SEC HQ no later than 10:00am to receive their visitor badges and be directed to the presentation room. The general discussion is anticipated to begin around 10:30 am. <br /><br />This event is intended to provide industry partners with an interactive session that will cover aspects of the current IT environment related to the above and thoughts on plans going forward. This will also be an opportunity for the SEC to accept feedback and best practices from industry around support for the full application/system development life cycle: systems/software design &amp; development; operations &amp; maintenance.<br /><br />The SEC is contemplating a multi-award vehicle for application/system design, development, operations &amp; maintenance, and support services. Project by project the SEC would determine the extent to which/all of the four areas would be included in the instant action. This could include platform support for various commercial or customized efforts as well. The SEC will consider having business size set-aside pools (i.e., unrestricted, small business, woman-owned, etc). The SEC does plan to provide a contractual mechanism to expand and contract the number of awards over time, based primarily on need and performance.<br /><br />The event will be free and open to the public. The event will not be hosted via webcast live. Pre-registration is required for the onsite attendance. Space is limited to three (3) participants per company.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Registration Instructions** <br /></span><br />Complete the attached "Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Day Registration Form" and submit to Anke Taylor at taylorank@sec.gov. <br /><strong>Registration forms shall be received no later than 10:00AM ET Wednesday June 14, 2017.

It is being held with the intent to provide industry members a forum to ask questions and provide the SEC with comments and guidance to better understand the current commercial market regarding support for the complete system development life cycle. In addition, the intent is for industry to provide input and thought to the SEC regarding the appropriate acquisition method to include evaluation factors.<br />&nbsp;
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Request for Information (RFI)**</span> <br /><br />Additionally, the SEC is requesting that all interested vendors provide information regarding their experience and capability to perform these types of services. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method to include possible set-asides.</p>
<p>Responses must include:<br />1) Business name, address, and company POC; <br />2) Size of business and socio-economic status; <br />3) DUNS number; <br />4) Number of years in application/system development business;<br />5) Number of years in the application operations &amp; maintenance business;<br />6) Does your company have a GSA schedule contract that includes IT support services? What NAICS code(s) are the services awarded under?<br />7) Recent experience in performing IT support services, specifically support for the full software development lifecycle from design and development to implementation and operations &amp; maintenance? Describe a few representative examples for the scope of services and the agency(ies) for which these services were performed in the last 5 years;<br />8) Recent experience supporting other Federal agencies in their transition to lean/agile approach to digital services. Describe where and how you have provided support in the transition to become a more lean and agile organization.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">** RFI Submission Instructions**</span> <br /><br />Standard Product Brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this RFI. No telephone or email inquiries will be accepted and requests for solicitation packages will not be granted, as no solicitation has been prepared at this time.<br /><br /><strong>Vendors who wish to respond to this RFI should send responses (no more than 10 pages) via email NLT 10:00AM ET <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monday</span> June 12, 2017 to taylorank@sec.gov.</strong> <br /><br />This RFI is intended to open a formal communication channel between industry and the SEC. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>The SEC welcomes industry comments and recommendations that will aid in the development of acquisition strategy and potentially lead to a formal solicitation.</em></span> The SEC may conduct one-on-one communications with interested vendors in an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>Proprietary information and trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on all materials. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.
