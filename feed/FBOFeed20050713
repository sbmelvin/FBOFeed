<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for 1.  One (1) each of a Portable Vacuum Calibration System.  The system shall be capable of directly calibrating all ambient air pressure transducer flight hardware currently in use in the NASA Balloon Program's Command and Data Module (CDM).  The transducers are MKS model 722 Baratron Absolute Capacitance Manometers with ranges of 10, 100 and 1000 Torr.  The calibration system shall directly interface and support these transducers and provide NIST traceable calibration over their pressure ranges.  Vacuum reading accuracy shall be +/- 0.1% of reading, or better.  The system shall be self-contained with the exception of AC power and Nitrogen gas supply. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from MKS Instruments of Wilmington MA.	Market research was conducted to find a vacuum system designed to calibrate pressure transducers at the required pressure ranges.  This includes a very specific type of vacuum chamber designed for stable operation at lower than normal vacuum pressures.  The system must also include a calibrated pressure standard which reads the pressure at the required accuracy.  The system must be compatible with existing NASA flight hardware (MKS Model 722 manometers).  None of the products researched met these criteria except the products available from MKS Instruments.  It was therefore determined a result of the market research that the products needed are only available from one source. THE AUTHORITY FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION IS FOUND IN 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(2). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 27, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, San Luis National Wildlife Refuge Complex, 947 West Pacheco Boulevard, Suite C, Los Banos, CA 93635 manages three refuges including the 26,090-acre San Luis National Wildlife Refuge (SNLNWR).  The SNLNWR contains a 760-acre elk enclosure that is bounded by 5.2 miles of wire mesh fence.    This elk enclosure was established in 1974 and provides for the semi-wild maintenance of some 35-80 tule elk that are intensively managed by the refuge in cooperation with the State of California for restocking, research, and outreach functions. The maintenance of this captive elk herd is a priority activity for the SNLNWR, however, the fence, which is now some 30 years old, is in need of repair.  This project requires the removal and replacement of worn fence components (wire mesh fence panels, some fence posts, deadmen, anchors and gates).  Vendor must  have the expertise and equipment to remove, repair, and replace existing fence while maintaining fence integrity to avoid elk escape from the enclosure at all times.

<DESC>NOAA’s Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) has developed a Multi-cultural Education for Resource Issues Threatening Oceans (MERITO). The proposed contract is to develop and provide expanded bilingual outreach and education programs about marine and coastal environments and will effectively inform Latino citizens about marine and coastal environments in central California. Although this action plan will focus on outreach programs for Latino citizens, future education plan will include all culturally diverse groups. The three main programs of MERITO serve to 1. Collaborate with K-12 schools, adult schools and community groups to build upon and foster new community-based outreach for Hispanic youth, adults, migrant families, and community leaders; 2. Collaborate with natural resource management agencies like California Department of Parks & Recreation and National Estuarine Research Reserves to increase visitation by Hispanic youth, adults and migrant families through site-based outreach; and 3. Collaborate with colleges and universities to develop and provide teacher trainings and college internships for Hispanic-serving teachers and undergraduate and graduate level students. The contract will consist of a base year with two additional option years.   All questions regarding this requirement shall be sent to Paul.J.Reed@noaa.gov.

The period of occupancy will be from early January through late May of each year commencing in 2006.  The contract will contain a Base Period and four (4) option periods of 1 year each.  Due to the nature of the work the firefighting crew does and the fact that the crew’s travel depends on weather conditions and fire danger across the United States, the crew could spend the entire time at the contracted facilities or be away for a considerable time.  Over the past 17 years, the crew dispatched away for an average of 60 days of the total 125-day period.  
The solicitation will be posted by COB on July 28, 2005.  
The pre-proposal meeting will be held on August 4, at 10:00 a.m. at the US Forest Service Supervisor's office at 160A Zillicoa Street, Asheville, NC in the 2nd floor conference room.  For directions please call 828-257-4200.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Aspects Software Ltd, 124 Princes Street, Edinburgh, Scotland  EH2 4AD. The proposed contract action is for a Customized Computer System. This structure includes the following: power monitor and power analyzer: timing analyzer tool for GSM SIM cards and terminals,  powersim GSM terminal testing environment, toolkit test suite, pre-conformance testing for GSM terminals against the 3GPP TS GSM 11.10-4 release 99 specification, powerscript GSM SIM testing environment, for the development of customized test scripts, SIM test suite SIM validation suite for 3GPP TS 11.17 specification applet, aspects developer javacard applet development environment support. 

The smartstation provides a means to evaluate communication between a mobile phone and a GSM SIM or 3G USIM. Sitting between the SIM/USIM and the mobile handset, the SmartStation2 enables simulation and testing tools within the suites to have full access to the communications between card and terminal. PowerAnalyser produces a graphical display of all communication across the MEICC interface, for both GSM and 3G phones and cards. Each contact has its own section of the screen enabling engineers to identify electrical, timing and software problems. Any two events can be timed to accuracy of one clock cycle, up to 5MHz. PowerSIM and PowerUSIM combine a full GSM Phase 2+ SIM or 3G USIM simulation with a rapid Java applet development environment. Ideal for trying out new applet ideas or testing the functionality of mobile equipment, a highly readable API makes custom test applet development a rapid process. Confidence in the Toolkit functionality of mobile handsets can be gained through the supplied test applets. As a simulation, full control is in the engineer’s hands to test a mobile phone’s handling of non-Toolkit functionality such as voltage switching, parity errors, application error handling and proprietary data fields. PowerScript – GSM and 3G testing environment PowerScript is a powerful testing environment for more general testing of SIM and USIM cards. A high level JAVA API enables engineers to test the full range of SIM/USIM behavior, card profile validity and file system and data integrity. 

According to FAR PART 6.302 this will be a Sole Source Acquisition. It has been determined through market research, trade shows, and conferences that there is no alternative solution that exists or any other providers in the market place. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received (quote with product specifications) will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This procurement shall be awarded under Simplified Acquisition Procedures; NAICS 541512.

Requirements of this contract are not limited to existing documents.  However, existing documents can be found on the WBDG website, http://www.wbdg.org.  All specification and design criteria documents shall be produced in accordance with the latest version of MIL-STD 3007, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE STANDARD PRACTICE FOR UNIFIED FACILITIES CRITERIA AND UNIFIED FACILITIES GUIDE SPECIFICATIONS; UFC 1-300-01, CRITERIA FORMAT STANDARD; and UFC 1-300-02, UNIFIED FACILITIES GUIDE SPECIFICATION (UFGS) FORMAT STANDARD.  Standard drawings shall be produced in accordance with the U.S. Naval CAD Standard.  The services may also include bench scale and prototype modeling, development of database and web-enabled design criteria support tools compatible with the WBDG web pages; (b) Quality Control Services:  These shall include constructability/quality reviews where issues arise during design or construction.  Generally, issues will be associated with adequacy of criteria definition; and (c) Cost Engineering Support Services:  These shall include development of parametric building cost models and preliminary and detailed project estimates; life cycle, economic, risk analyses and other cost engineering support services.

In order to assist the Command to more efficiently review all qualifications statements, provide staffing, consultant support and experience listed by each category of proposed work, staff and consultant support should clearly show each individual's background, registration(s), degrees, years experience with the firm, years experience as consultant to your firm (when applicable), specialized experience of the individual and individual awards or owner/customer points of contact.

The A&E must demonstrate his and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all services.  Evaluation Factors (1) through (6) are of equal importance; factors (7), (8) and (9) are of lesser importance and will be used as tie-breakers among technically equal firms.  Specific evaluation factors include:

1.  Specialized Experience:
(a) Past experience and services in the areas of:  Preparation and understanding of the UFC and UFGS standards.  A broad representation of recent experience and preparation of criteria and specifications for the military services and their field entities is required.  Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection and the principals of sustainable improvement to facilities will apply to all criteria preparations.  Exhibited understanding of the DoD acquisition process is required.  Web-enabled tools and database development integral to criteria resources are part of this factor.  Architectural or Engineering professional registration of those preparing criteria documents is mandatory.
(b) Quality Control Services:  Generally we will presume staff support from the foregoing item (a) unless shown otherwise.  However, types of experience in quality assessment, and methodology(ies) used should be discussed.
(c) Cost Engineering:  The variety of sources and databases used and reliability of estimates produced shall be presented.  NAVFAC has adopted SUCCESS™ as its corporate estimating system.  Experience with this product and accuracy should be exhibited; cost engineering professional registration should be exhibited.

2.  Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence of the Individual Design Team Members:
(a) Active professional registration.
(b) Past experience in the type of work required or evidence of similar relevant experience (with present and other firms) and roles of staff members specifically on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1.
(c) Capability to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of services and ability to surge to meet unexpected project demands.

3.  Ability to perform the work to schedules, i.e., ability to perform several task concurrently and sustain the loss of key personnel while accomplishing the work within required time limits.  Firms will be evaluated in terms of impact of this workload on the staff's projected workload during the contract period.

4.  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated in past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, and cost control (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1).  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.

5.  Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy and discipline coordination of plans and specifications - list key personnel responsible.

6.  Broad knowledge of building code and emerging code requirements over a broad geographical area.  Firms will be evaluated with respect to the broad geographical area of the contract, their knowledge of codes, emerging International code consolidation(s), laws, construction materials and practices.

7.  Firm location (provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).

8.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

9.  Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan:  Firms will be evaluated on the extent to which they identify and commit to the published Small Business Subcontracting Program.  The Secretary of the Navy has assigned the Naval Facilities Engineering Command goals expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses of 74.85%.  Included in the SB goals are targets for:  Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) - 15.60%; Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) - 13.92%; Veterans Owned Small Business (VOSB) - 0.12%; Services Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) - 0.12%; and HUBZone Small Business - 1.17%.

Large business firms shall submit their Navy-wide SF 295, Summary Subcontract Report with their SF 330.  The slated firms will be required to provide a preliminary subcontracting plan (support for small business subcontracting) as part of the interview.

The duration of the contract will be for one (1) year from the date of an initial contract award with four (4) additional one year option periods.  The total amount that may be paid under this contract (including option years) will not exceed $5,000,000 for the entire contract term.  The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial Task Order.  The options may be exercised within the time frame specified in the resultant contract at the sole discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the A&E performance under the subject contract.  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  No other general notification to firms for other similar projects performed under this contract will be made.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Integrated Modeling and Simulation (IM&S) in which the contractor will perform activities to define, coordinate, administer, and integrate the IM&S efforts, with a special focus on modeling and simulation technology that directly supports the preliminary and detailed engineering design phases.  Particular emphasis will also be placed on developing a comprehensive strategy, and an associated implementation plan, for evolving the existing modeling and simulation capability into an integral Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) hardware/software-in-the-loop (H/SWIL) test and evaluation capability. The contractor will be required to complete four tasks in this requirement.  Task One: The contractor will assist in the development of a comprehensive, and fully integrated, suite of modeling and simulation capabilities with which to conduct preliminary and detailed Space Transportation vehicle and system design and development analysis.  Task Two: The contractor will interface with and work within existing efforts, led by ESMD IM&S representatives, to ensure a common, standardized, and rational approach is being used for all M&S capabilities development. Specifically, the contractor shall ensure the ESMD's integrated design/analysis data modeling, and integrated modeling and simulation capabilities development approach coherently includes: a) modeling and simulation efforts conducted in the conceptual design phase; and, b) test and evaluation procedures required for requirements validation and integration testing.  Task Three: The contractor will, in conjunction with the ESMD IM&S team partners, contribute to, and coordinate development of, a definitive strategy and associated implementation plan that: a) uses hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) and software-in-the-loop (SWIL) testing as a logical extension of the early systems lifecycle phase modeling and simulation efforts; and b) ensures the HWIL and SWIL capabilities are intelligently integrated into the overall modeling and simulation effort.  Task Four:  The contractor will adhere to the ESMD Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) policy and associated procedures as they pertain to the developed M&S capabilities.  After the VV&A approach has been sufficiently definitized, the contractor will initiate and complete the requisite VV&A activity for the preliminary and detailed design capabilities that comprise the integrated Space Transportation vehicle and system modeling and simulation construct. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from Miltec Corporation, 678 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, AL	35806, a Veteran-Owned Small Business using GSA Contract GS-23F-0020K, Professional Engineering Services, under schedule 871-4, Test and Evaluation.

<CONTACT>DAN M. NEUSTEDTER, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 919-541-4749, E-Mail: neustedter.dan@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a contract to design, build and install a Humidification, Heat Recovery and Reverse Osmosis Water Treatment System (HHRROWTS) for EPA facilities at Research Triangle Park, NC based upon drawings supplied with the solicitation. An Overview of the Existing Mechanical System is detailed in the Six (6) parts below: (1) The existing building is ventilated, humidified, dehumidified, heated and cooled by seven built-up air handling units located in the Penthouse Mechanical Equipment Room of Building A.  The air-handling units utilize 100 percent outdoor air and serve laboratories and animal holding areas.  Six of seven air handlers run concurrently and one is redundant. (2) The existing air-handling units utilize compressed air atomizing humidifiers located inside the air-handling units downstream of the heating coils.  (3) Existing chillers in the Central Utility Plant (CUP) cool the facility.  The backup is an air-cooled chiller. (4) Existing high temperature hot water boilers located in the CUP heat the facility.  The high temperature hot water is currently piped from the CUP to the existing unfired 80 PSI steam generators located in the first floor Mechanical Equipment Room in Building D. A backup 80 PSI Steam Boiler is located in the Tunnel Level Mechanical Equipment Room located in Building A. (5) Heating hot water which is supplied to the heating coils in the air-handling units is generated in heat exchanger served with 80 PSI steam. (6) The existing controls system is a TAC America utilizing direct digital control.  Computer, keyboard, CRT, and printer are located in the maintenance office for controlling and monitoring the system, including alarm reporting. An Overview of the New Mechanical System is detailed in the Three (3) parts below: (1) The outdoor air will be treated by a new sensible energy recovery system utilizing a new runaround coil loop, new pumps, and new heat recovery coils which will be installed into the existing air handling units and the built-up exhaust plenums also located in the Penthouse Mechanical Equipment Room in Building. (2) After passing over the new heat recovery coil in the existing air handling unit, the outdoor air will be humidified as required with a new low absorption distance (<24") low pressure steam manifold to achieve the space humidity requirements. (3) Existing VAV boxes with terminal heating coils will provide the necessary ventilation air quantities and supply air quantities with discharge temperature modulated by the terminal heating coils to satisfy individual thermal, moisture and ventilation requirements of each zone.  This requirement will be procured utilizing unrestricted, full and open competition procedures and, therefore, no set-asides will be used.  A firm-fixed price contract type is contemplated.  The base performance period is planned for about 5 months and this will probably include optional installation tasks; these options will not be for options periods but for optional tasks within the approximately 5 month base period. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) No. 333415 applies with a size standard of 750 employees. It is estimated that this solicitation will be issued around March 23, 2005 with proposals due approximately thirty (30) days after the issuance date.  It is anticipated that a site visit will be held at the EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC. within a few weeks after release of the solicitation.  Further information will be provided in the solicitation. The solicitation will be available solely through the EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available. All future information about this acquisition, including amendments (if any), will also be distributed solely through the EPA's web site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. Telephone and FAX requests will not be honored.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Alan Scanio, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-9616
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) intends to issue a modification to contract 68-W-02-035 with Syracuse Environmental Research Associates (SERA), Inc to increase the scope of the contract approximately $400,000 in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), and FAR 6.302-2 (Unusual and Compelling Urgency). The contract 68-W-02-035 entitled "Probabilistic Risk Assessments for the Environmental Fate and Effects Division" was awarded competitively to the Syracuse Environmental Research Associates, Inc. (SERA) in May 2002 as a small business  set-aside. With the enactment of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA) in 2003, the time frame for the contractor to complete the risk assessments became significantly accelerated.  In order to adjust the schedules and complete registration and reregistration risk assessments at such  an accelerated rate, additional contractual support was needed to perform the requirements.  The burden of meeting the accelerated timeframes was absorbed by the level of effort already included in the contract, however the level of effort was consumed far more quickly than the original periods of  performance would indicate.  Additionally, it is now estimated that the capacity of this contract will be exhausted during the first quarter of fiscal year 2006.  This effectively shortened the life of the contract by 1-1? years.  Given current procurement legislation, practice, and procedures,  award of a competitive follow-on contract cannot be completed until approximately the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. The purpose of this increase in scope is to provide uninterrupted contractor support until the award of a competitive follow-on contract.  These circumstances are both unusual  in that they arise from passage of legislation after contract award and compelling in that the Agency is subject to adverse litigation and penalties if it should fail in its obligations under PRIA. 	Failure to issue this sole source modification will result in unacceptable delays to the completion  date of risk assessments set by the Agency.  Most of these actions are subject to the decision review periods in accordance with PRIA legislation.  If EFED does not complete these risk assessments by the due dates set by the Agency, the registrant can seek judicial review against EPA.  Delay in  issuance of this sole-source modification  will result in serious injury to the Government in the form of adverse litigation and penalties. Further information on competing for the follow on can be found under record number: FY 05 - 243 in EPA's forecast database  at: http://yosemite.epa.gov/oarm/oam/forecastdatabase.nsf See note 22.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   NAICS Code: 334516 The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Services under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The  purpose of this purchase order is to procure the following items: 1	# Q221031H	Perkin Elmer ELAN DRC II reaction cell ICP-MS PN special MAS 2	# N8120541 	Installation Solution 3	# N8122248	Chiller/Heater exchanger 4	# WE016558	Chem Chiller Coolant 5	# 09404818	Dell GX-280 tower 6	#W1008680	Mass  Flow Controller 7	Trade-in discount for an Agilent 7500C No solicitations or request for quote is available.  It has been determined that Perkin Elmer is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement. Perking Elmer's equipment is capable of selectively removing or separating the  analyte from the interferent due it's ability to operate at thermal or near thermal conditions.  The DRCII allows for the analysis of krypton, a typical contaminant of argon gas used for the plasma, which interferes with the analysis of selenium.  The DRC II can analyze selenium at mass 80.  In  addition, EPA's current software and exchange parts used with the Perkin Elmer ELAN 6000 ICP-MS and the autosampler are both compatible with ELAN DRC II reaction cell ICP-MS PN special MAS.   Not withstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may  submit a response, which if received by July 25, 2005 may be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted electronically to Stacy Hill, Contract Specialist at hill.stacy@epa.gov.  A determination not to compete this proposed requirement based upon the responses to this  notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Stacy Hill, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at hill.stacy@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS FOR STUDENT SERVICES TO BE AWARDED ON A CONTRACT BASIS BY THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.  The solicitation number is U2E119 (RFQ-RT-05-00320).  The Human Exposure and Atmospheric Sciences Division (HEASD) of the National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL), Office of Research and Development (ORD), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is seeking an individual, at least 18 years of age who is a recent graduate of a degree program in the chemical or biological sciences, to provide services under a contractual  agreement in support of human exposure research.  Applicants who are currently enrolled, or plan to enroll, in graduate level programs will be considered.  The preferred student/recent graduate will have broad academic training and work experience in conducting toxicological studies and possess  general skills/experience in laboratory work. HEASD's Method Development and Application Branch (MDAB) develops, modifies, improves, evaluates, and validates methods and instrumentation for measuring human and ecosystems exposures, and provides data input for human exposure models. The research  focus is to develop and apply methods which will be used by EPA's measurement programs to elucidate source-to-dose pathways and to help define the important and critical routes of exposure.  The Branch plans and conducts research and development to advance state-of-the-art sampling technologies,  analytical methodologies, and analytical instrumentation for the investigation and characterization of human and ecological exposures to environmental stressors. The Branch designs and field tests screening instruments. The Branch plans and conducts field studies specifically designed to elucidate  human and eco-exposure concerns.  For additional information regarding HEASD or MDAB, visit the division home page at http://www.epa.gov/heasd/. The student/recent graduate contractor will provide technical support for research focusing on the development of bioassays involving ecological  receptors as well as chemical extractions and quantitation of toxic elements. The different tasks include, but are not limited to:1) Preparation of reagents and standards;2) Directed development of bioassays;  3) Directed sample extraction and quantitative analysis using atomic absorption  spectroscopy (AA); 4) Conducting literature/internet searches and reviewing scientific literature; 5) The collection, processing, and compiling of data or other information into databases/spreadsheets using a variety of Windows-based software (e.g., Microsoft Excel/Word/Access, WordPerfect,  EndNote, etc.); 6) Conducting descriptive statistical analyses (i.e., mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median, etcetera) of data. The student/recent graduate contractor shall perform tasks related to one or more of these areas in support of the MDAB Human Exposure research program.  The  student/recent graduate contractor will perform duties, as requested, according to specifications and instructions provided by their mentor. Where appropriate, the student/recent graduate will maintain careful and accurate records in designated laboratory notebooks. These notebooks, and all other  data produced under this order will be the property of EPA. All necessary instructions and training will be provided by Ms. Sharon Harper, who will also serve as the mentor. This work is to begin in late September 2005.  The purchase order will be for one year and authorize 1920 hours of effort on  a not-to-exceed basis.  The work will be performed between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on work days.  An option will be  included in the purchase order to extend the contract, at the consent of both the Government and the student contractor, for an additional year for the same  level of  effort.  EPA will award either one or more purchase orders based on this Announcement/solicitation in order to achieve the 1,920 hours of effort.  So, both part-time and full-time applicants will be considered, with the EPA giving preference in the evaluation process to full-time applicants with  the required background.  Applicants must indicate with their submission whether they will be available part-time or full-time, and the average number of hours each week they can work.  Work will be performed principally in a laboratory setting with a duty location of 109 TW Alexander Drive,  Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

Student/recent graduate contractors will be paid the basic hourly rate only for the number of hours worked and do not receive overtime premium.  Student/recent graduate contractors do  not accrue leave or holiday benefits and are not paid for any non-work days, regardless of the reason.  Federal, State, Local, and Social Security taxes will not be withheld; student/recent graduate contractors are responsible for reporting income to authorities and paying all  taxes. Student/recent graduate contractors are responsible for all costs of transportation to and from the principal duty station location.  EPA does not provide housing, meals or other living expenses while working at the principal duty station.

<DESC>The NIST Acquisition Management Division intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) with Jian Zheng, 21151 Camomile Court, Germantown, MD  20876-6918.  The basis for this sole source determination is that the current requirement is a logical follow-on to the previous, competitively awarded, contract, SB1341-04-W-1470.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511 and the size standard is $21M.

The original effort was for development of a foundation for establishing standards and specifications for testing digital media and establishing an archival grading methodology.  The Contractor successfully and satisfactorily developed methodologies to perform research and testing to determine life expectancy and archival storage suitability in DVD recordable, CD-ROM, and CD-R media and compared capabilities of these media to other storage media types.  

The current requirement builds directly on work completed under contract SB1341-04-W-1470.  In the interest of economy and efficiency, the Government intends to issue a sole source award to Jian Zheng.  The Government has determined that a new competitive solicitation would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements and incur substantial duplication of cost and effort that cannot be expected to be recovered through competition. 

No solicitation package will be issued.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing.  Responses received by 4:00 pm EST, July 22, 2005 will be considered by the Government.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability and experience in testing digital media (DVD recordable, CD-ROM, and CD-R media) to fulfill the requirement.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY – The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the National Center for Rural Health Works (NCRHWks) at Oklahoma State University, Department of Agricultural Economics, 508 Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK  74078, to continue development of a national information center (Rural Health Works) that will provide analysis, technical assistance, and information to policymakers, researchers, State Offices of Rural Health, Cooperative Extension Service and rural communities on the importance of health care services to the local economy.  

The focus of this project has been to (1) train State-level officials in how to measure the economic impact of health care services (IMPLAN), (2) conduct analysis of the economic impact that selected health policies have on the local economy, (3) conduct a full community engagement/planning process and (4) help providers identify new service opportunities that was developed by the Oklahoma State University.  Most States have participated in these training workshops. The Government intends on using the lessons learned from this successful project on a national basis. 

The program originated through the Extension Program at Oklahoma State University (OSU) and has also been maintained and further developed through the Extension Program at OSU.  OSU has provided the NCRHWks activities and products to Oklahoma rural communities for the past 25-30 years and continues to provide them each year.  The OK program was the original basis of the NCRHWks program; it was modeled and the templates and sample technical reports were developed by OSU at their own expense and became the pilot of the NCRHWks original initiative in 1998.  OSU has continued to develop and provide additional products, as well as providing technical expertise, training, and advice to the other States in their statewide NCRHWks program development.  The OK program through OSU Extension has become the National Center for Rural Health Works.  OSU has the expertise and trained staff to provide the training and technical expertise to other States, and to continue their development of new health impact areas. 

The anticipated period of performance for this project is for one (1) year with 2 twelve month option periods.  The statutory authority is FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2) and 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements without substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Oklahoma State University developed the models and the database that RHW uses.   Any other organization would have to duplicate the database that has been developed by Oklahoma State University at their expense.  A Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared by the Government.  Any interested party may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by submitting a capability statement in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the services without incurring substantial cost duplication.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A draft Statement of Work is attached for informational purposes only.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The NAICS Code is 541990.   See Numbered Note 22.

These redesigned FLDB assemblies will have the forgings machined per the Boeing drawings, and will include two new bolt assemblies, which are required for the new bellcranks.  The current FLDB requires a non-destructive inspection every 100-flight hours.  In order to perform the inspection, the flight control system must be disassembled and the FLDB removed from the aircraft.  Breaking the integrity of the flight control system increases the risk of improper assembly and the possibility of accident.  Forward deployed H-46 squadrons have identified the need for an inspection-free bellcrank due to the high tempo of flight operations.  The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to the Boeing Company, Boeing Helicopters, Ridley Park, PA.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program (SRP) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Pennsylvania State University, Department of Geography, 302 Walker Building, University Park, PA  16802-5011 for the development of a classification module for an Exploratory Spatio-Temporal Analytic Toolkit (ESTAT) specifically for cancer surveillance.  The Surveillance Research Program (SRP) directs the collection and analysis of pertinent data in order to answer key questions about cancer incidence, morbidity, mortality, and cancer-related health status in diverse regions and populations in the United States. SRP provides leadership, through its Statistical Research and Applications Branch, in developing statistical methodologies appropriate for analyzing trends and for evaluating the impact of cancer control interventions as well as geographic, social, behavioral, genetic, and health care delivery factors on the cancer burden.  Pennsylvania State University Geographic Visualization Science, Technology and Applications (GeoVISTA) Center developed the ESTAT module for the GeoVISTA platform which links (dynamically) a multivariate parallel coordinate plot with a map, a scatter plot and time series plot and permits interactive data exploration by the user.   The new ESTAT module will add functionality to this tool so that it can be used to examine similarities and differences among places, e.g., U.S. counties, on the basis of user-specified covariates. The new module will be used to preprocess county information in order to identify “peer counties”, counties expected to have similar cancer rates, for display in the NCI State Cancer Profiles web-based system for cancer statistics dissemination (http://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov).  The ESTAT module shall explore the similarity of geographic areas by displaying a hierarchical classification tree for up to 5000 geographic units and up to 100 attributes for these units. All U.S. counties shall be used, but the software should be generalized enough that the user could select counties or tracts within a single state as input.  In addition to the graphical display, it should be possible for the user to download the output, e.g., a cluster identifier for each county.  The module should allow differing algorithmic weights for the attributes and include in the attribute set the geographic location, e.g., latitude and longitude. For example, income might be weighted twice as much as education in one application; a high weight on the location variable would favor the assignment of spatial neighbors to the same cluster.  The ESTAT module shall run efficiently on what is considered a typical desktop PC in 2005.  The vendor should also provide recommendations for modifying a self-organizing map module for use in ESTAT.  The Pennsylvania State University under the leadership of Dr. Alan MacEachren is the only known source to the NCI Researcher who can create this module.  All development of the GeoVISTA platform and related software modules has been done by the staff of Dr. MacEachren’s GeoVISTA Center at Pennsylvania State University; they created the basic geovisualization software platform which is the basis for the ESTAT software module. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on July 28, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541990; Size Standard is 6 million.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) through the Chemical, Biological Medical Systems (CBMS) Joint Project Management Office and the Medical Identification and Treatment Systems Joint Product Management Office (MITS-JPMO) has a requirement to develop and license a second generation prophylactic product, Bioscavenger Increment II, to be used in humans against organophosphorus nerve agents.  The product should be capable of strongly binding or degrading organophosphorus nerve agents before they can exhibit t heir toxic effects.  Potential candidates might include human butyrylcholinesterase (other than plasma-derived) or acetylcholinesterase, other proteins, or compounds that have the property of binding or degrading nerve agents and/or preventing inhibition o f acetylcholinesterase.   Development of the nerve agent prophylactic product shall require a Contractor to coordinate and manage the activities associated with advanced development of the product.  The Contractor will be responsible for conducting the various activities associated  with drug/biologic development in a manner that is consistent with eventual approval or licensure by the FDA, to include management of any subcontractors.  Activities will include manufacturing process development and related tasks, current Good Manufactu ring Practices (cGMP)-compliant small-scale manufacturing and testing of the Bioscavenger product, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-compliant acute toxicology testing  filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and conducting a Phase 1 clinica l trial in accordance with FDA regulations and guidelines.   There will be an option for continuing advanced development through FDA approval (or licensure) of the product following the successful completion of the Phase 1 clinical trial and Government reviews.  These follow-on advanced development activities may in clude, but are not necessarily limited to, large-scale manufacturing, process validation, definitive animal efficacy and expanded safety studies, conduct of Phase 2 and/or 3 clinical trials, and filing of a New Drug Application/Biologics License Applicatio n.  There will be a 2nd option for the production of 90,000 doses of the product, to be exercised following the successful licensure or approval of the product and successful government reviews.   The initial advanced development activities, from award of contract through completion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, are expected to require 2.5 to 3 years to complete. The post-Phase 1 development through approval of the Bioscavenger product by the FDA i s expected to take about 4 to 4.5 years. The DoD will only consider those Bioscavenger Increment II candidates for which preliminary in vivo safety and efficacy data already exist.  Due to urgent need and a stringent timeline, consideration cannot be given to chemicals or proteins for which there  are no proof of concept data in relevant animal models. These preliminary studies should be substantial but do not need to be GLP compliant.  Offerors will be requested to submit technical and cost proposal that clearly represents technical and regulato ry approaches. Participants must demonstrate the ability to provide GLP, cGMP, and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) compliance related to the development of the product for use in pre-clinical and clinical studies.   The purpose of this synopsis is to give advanced notice of a Request for Proposal (RFP) that will be issued on or about July 29, 2005 and interested firms to indentify themselves to the Government to receive a copy of the solicitation when issued. General requirements of the solicitation and its options are mentioned in this synopsis.  The solicitation will contain detailed instructions for response to the near-term requirement of developing a nerve agent prophylaxis through a Phase 1 clinical trial and the  longer-term requirements that include approval or licensure and production of doses.   The requirements for succes sful execution of the contract encompass a broad range of capabilities.  Offerors are encouraged to partner or subcontract with contract manufacturers, clinical research organizations, etc. as necessary to span these capabilities.   All responsible sources may participate in this acquisition, which shall be considered by the agency. These sources must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for award. All firms that desire to be considered must iden tify themselves no later than 4:30PM, 27 July 2005 to the Contract Specialist listed below to receive the solicitation when issued by the Government.

We anticipate that may take another two weeks.  In  the interim, we plan to post an updated draft in the next few days to pass on  the incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. As you are aware, we have been on a very aggressive schedule.  The delays we  are experiencing put our contract award schedule at risk.  We are requesting  your cooperation in helping us make up some schedule time by reducing the  number of days required for proposal preparation.  If you plan to bid this  program, request you provide the PCO feedback on the acceptability of reducing  the number of days for proposal submission from 45 days to a lesser number,  and identify the minimum time you believe is required.  Request your response  by 1 April 2005.  When a go-ahead is received from SAF/AQ and OSD, the AEASS  will determine the proposal due date and adjust the expected contract award  date accordingly.  UPDATE 22 March 2005:  A new attachment with the title of Questions and  Answers has been added to the document library below. UPDATE 21 March 2005:  Proposal due date information is changed as follows:   If the RFP is not released by 1 April 2005, there will be a day for day slip  in the proposal due date.   Also, information about the Past Performance volume due date is changed to  read as follows: Each offeror is requested to submit the Past Performance volume for relevant  Government contracts 28 days prior to the date established for receipt of  proposals.  Failure to submit early proposal information (Past Performance  volume) will not result in offeror disqualification.  Offerors are requested  to notify the PCO when the Past Performance volume is anticipated to be  submitted. UPDATE 9 March 2005 (Second update for this date):  RFP release is delayed  pending completion of the Government+s review/approval process.  Tentative  date for release is now 25 March 2005, in which case proposals will be due by  10 May 2005. However, the Past Performance Volume will be due by 15 Apr 2005.   The Government still plans to award the contract by the end of July 2005. Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors is modified by  making the following change to Table 3.1 Proposal Organization in Paragraph  3.1.5.2, Organization, Number of Copies, and Page Limits.  The maximum page  limit for Vol III, Past Performance, is now 60 pages.  Within those 60 pages,  there should be no more than 5 pages per each past contract.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

<SUBJECT>B -- Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Battlelab Broad Agency Announcement #2
<SOLNBR>BAA-UAVB-05-002
<RESPDATE>060906
<ARCHDATE>06102006
<CONTACT>David Huber, Contracting Officer, Phone 702-652-3366, Fax 702-652-3367, Email david.huber@nellis.af.mil
<DESC>NOTE:  This is a modification to BAA-UAVB-05-002.  In paragraph B, "INTRODUCTION," of original BAA, the closing date was listed as 9 July 2006.  This date was incorrect, and should read 9 June 2006.  No other changes have been made to this BAA.  

A.         THIS IS A BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA-UAVB-05-002) FOR UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE SENSE AND AVOID CAPABILITY.

B.         INTRODUCTION 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regulation 7610.4 states remotely operated aircraft (aka UAVs) must have
“…equivalent level of safety, comparable to see-and-avoid requirements for manned aircraft” in order to operate like manned aircraft in the National Air Space (NAS).  The capability must be effective against all air traffic, with or without active, transponder-based collision avoidance systems.  The capability must interact with -- but not replace -- other safety of flight mechanisms used by manned aircraft.  Currently, no onboard “sense and avoid” capability
exists.  UAVs operating in the NAS must obtain Certificates of Authorization, a cumbersome process, and/or use either chase planes or ground-based observers.  The Operational Requirements Documents (ORDs) for both RQ-4 (Global Hawk) and MQ-1 (Predator) require operation in the NAS.  The UAV Battlelab is interested in any systems that would be able to perform the “sense and avoid” function while adhering to the size, weight and power constraints of a Predator-class aircraft.   The system must have at least an area of coverage 110 degrees right and left of centerline and plus or minus 15 degrees of flight line.

The UAV Battlelab invites concept papers with preliminary cost estimates to satisfy the requirements for the “sense and avoid” function described above.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369 “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.”  Concept papers in response to this announcement shall be submitted to 99 CONS/LGCC, marked for BAA-UAVB-05-002, 5865 Swaab Blvd., Bldg. 588, Nellis AFB NV 89191-7063.  Electronic submission of concept papers may be made to david.huber@nellis.af.mil by attaching the document to e-mail.  Responses should reference the above BAA number and provide contact information (name, phone number, e-mail address, etc.).  This announcement is effective and open until 9 JUNE 2006.  Concept papers in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during this period.  There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic and interested parties should be on the alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.


C.         OBJECTIVE

(1) Technical Description: 

The proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of a MATURE TECHNOLOGY.

All responses to this BAA will be evaluated for applicability to the aforementioned need.         


D.         ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Potential offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference number BAA-UAVB-05-002 with their submissions.  Potential offerors are required to register their company information at www.ccr.gov before any contracts can be awarded to that company.

<DESC>The Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) Acquisition Division is seeking potential sources capable of providing professional services in support of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) role in evaluating and managing critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and risk arising as a result of foreign ownership, control and influence.  The Government’s primary objective for the proposed acquisition is to obtain professional services to define, implement, manage and support DHS strategies, plans and operations to address risk posed by the foreign ownership, control and influence of U.S. critical infrastructure components.  A resultant contract would require at least the following key services: perform national critical infrastructure vulnerability and risk assessment; develop risk methodologies, theory and algorithms in support of a highly-classified, periodic report for high-level U.S. Government policy and decision makers; support policy and decision making in other related Government programs (e.g., FCC licensing and authorization of foreign telecommunications and information technology service providers operating in the U.S.); and provide long-term and trend assessments of the vulnerabilities and risks accruing from foreign operation, control and influence of U.S. critical infrastructure entities.  Activities will derive from the analysis and assessment of both open-source and highly-classified information sources covering the full spectrum of technological and other related activities in such fields as: aerospace engineering and production, biology, computers, defense systems, energy production, finance and investment, information technology, marine systems, microelectronics, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, etc.  The short timeframes (30 to 90 days) permitted by statute and regulation to complete these activities require that sources employ or have immediate access to critical infrastructure specialists with expertise in all critical infrastructure and key resource sectors and have current TS/SCI clearances.  Specific tasks include, but are not limited to, preparation of research and analysis summaries and reports; developing and implementing program strategic and tactical metrics and supporting documentation; coordinating program efforts with Government and private sectors, development and use of automation tools to optimize program effectiveness; and developing documentation in support of program related goals, objectives and performance measures.  The proposed acquisition will be for a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  This sources sought synopsis represents a market survey and is not a Request For Proposals or Invitation For Bids.  Interested sources are invited to submit a statement of capability to include company name, address, and point of contact, telephone number, e-mail address, facsimile number, and business size (indicating whether you are a large or small business for purposes of the assigned NAICS code).

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE - ARMED GUARD SERVICES, NAVAL STATION, GREAT LAKES, ILLINOIS.

The corresponding SBA size standard is $28.5 Million.  The estimated cost range for this solicitation is over $100,000,000.  This procurement will result in a firm fixed price contract.  

Only U.S. citizens may participate in this solicitation and resultant contract.

Part I of Solicitation N44255-04-R-9102 will be available on 27 June 2005.  NOTE:  Full plans and specifications will not be available until approximately November 2005.

This project will construct an 180,000-ft2 multi-level (approximately 270 ft by 360 ft), below-grade, earth covered, internal and external blast hardened, heavily reinforced concrete structure.  Special features of the facility include:  Two tunnels (approximately 400 ft long, 20 ft wide, and 16 ft tall) to provide heavy vehicle access to and from the below-grade levels; above ground mechanical and production support buildings; power-operated physical security and blast-resistant doors; (7) overhead bridge cranes (2 ton capacity), (3) elevators, lightning protection system, grounding system, emergency air purge system, and multiple independent HVAC systems (approximately 11).

The anticipated contract duration is approximately 1235 calendar days.  The exact duration will be stipulated in the solicitation.  

The Navy intends to issue the construction solicitation in two parts:

Part I will consist of Prequalifying of Sources in accordance with DFARS 236.272.  The purpose of Prequalifying firms is to develop a list of Qualified Firms who possess the proven competence to perform the construction of MCON P-973.  No pricing will be requested during prequalifications however firms must demonstrate the capability of bonding over $100,000,000.  The solicitation shall state the prequalification requirements but it is anticipated to include Prime and Major Subcontractor Experience.  Additionally, the Government will conduct a responsibility determination consistent with FAR Part 9.  Only firms who participate in the Prequalification of Sources and are determined to possess the necessary competencies will be able to participate in Part II, the Construction Request for Proposals (RFP).

Offerors will need to request by e-mail Part I of the solicitation, prequalification from the contracting officer (mark.snell@navy.mil).  

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all prequalification submissions at any time.  FIRMS ARE ADVISED THAT THE DETERMINATION OF PREQUALIFIED FIRMS MAY BE MADE WITHOUT COMMUNICATIONS OR CLARIFICATIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PREQUALIFICATION SUBMISSION RECEIVED.  Therefore, prequalification submissions should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Firms should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify or revise their qualifications.  FIRMS SUBMITTING PREQUALFICATIONS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED.  

Once the prequalification procedures are completed, qualified Prime Construction Contractors will be posted to the Navy’ s www.esol.navfac.navy.mil website to facilitate subcontracting opportunities.  All prime contractors/subcontractors/suppliers are advised to register and periodically review www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for any changes/additions.  There will be no site visits during prequalifications.  

A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for 9 August 2005 at the Assembly Hall at Jackson Park Community Center, Bremerton, WA.  Registration and a map are provided at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.  

Estimated closing date for receipt of prequalification submissions is 14:00 local time (PDT), 15 September 2005.

After the completion of Part I of the solicitation, Part II can commence.  Part II will consist of Source Selection (negotiated) best value procedures, as it has been determined in accordance with FAR 6.401 to be the most appropriate method of contracting for the subject project.  Only those firms found to possess the necessary competencies as stipulated in the Prequalification will participate in Part II, the Construction RFP.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be evaluated on the following factors:  1) Technical (Past Performance; Safety); 2) Management (Key Personnel; Management Organization; Small Business Utilization); and 3) Price.  Proposals will be evaluated to determine which offer provides the best value to the Government.    

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  OFFERORS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED.  

Anticipated construction contract award is January 2006.

Full plans and specifications will be issued only during Part II, Construction RFP.    Subcontractors/Suppliers shall be notified of plans and specifications availability via ESOL only.  It is each firm’s responsibility to periodically check www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for the specific date that plans and specifications shall be made available.  It is anticipated that offerors shall be charged for plans and specifications.  Additional information regarding plans and specifications distribution and charges will be included in the Part I Prequalification RFP.

<SUBJECT>20--Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)
<SOLNBR>RFQ-OH-05-00137
<RESPDATE>072205
<ARCHDATE>08222005
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 421490   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Amendment #1 Information:   Technical Question & Answers AUV Requirement,  The Original response date of 07/22/05 remains unchanged. Would there be a problem using a Russian built fuselage with a U.S. designed and built drive and  electronics?  Answer:  There is no prohibition against using a Russian built fuselage, as long as commonly replaced parts (such as O-rings) are readily available (i.e., if the fuselage comes with unusually sized O-rings that are difficult to purchase for replacement, that would be unacceptable). We use high mega-pixel Japanese built SLRs and specialized Japanese video cameras.  In our system we use a video camera and an SLR - we have the video camera coupled to the eyepiece of the SLR, so that both video and an SLR still use the same optical chain.  Would such a system implementation be  acceptable? Answer:   Yes. This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.   Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The current NAICS code is 423490 for this requirement. (the previous NAICS code from 1997 was 421490, which is also listed in the synopsis).  The specifications for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) are as follows:    Synopsis: An Autonomous  Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an advanced technology, multipurpose swimming robot that can effectively measure environmental parameters used to access ecological health and species-habitat interactions in aquatic environments.  AUVs  can be configured with a variety of sensor packages to measure  water quality, with video cameras to map habitats and biota (e.g. shellfish), and with side scan sonar to acoustically image seabed properties in both shallow and deep environments. This instrument will be a key component in a variety of research projects at AED in the Habitat Effects Branch, which  currently is conducting research in support of the Aquatic Stressors Framework's plan for Altered Habitat Research and focuses on coastal marshes, estuaries, and near shore habitats at the scale of habitat elements and habitat mosaics up to and including entire coastal ecosystems.   The Aquatic  Stressors Framework states that spatial habitat mapping will be a "vital tool" in application of the stressor-response models, and thus habitat mapping of shorelines, lakes, estuaries, and sub-estuaries should be a part of the quantitative research involved in creating the models.  AUVs are ideal  tools for assessing and mapping habitats and biota over large spatial scales and at speeds comparable to the rate processes of interest.  By outfitting the AUV with a video camera, side scan sonar unit, CTD and dissolved oxygen probe, real-time measurements of habitat quality and quantity (e.g.  bottom topography, presence of shellfish beds, dissolved oxygen levels, stratification, seagrass bed areal extent and level of patchiness) can be collected relatively rapidly.  The habitat and biota data collected by the AUV will be essential for ground truthing, over large spatial scales, the  habitat alteration (stressor)-species response models and habitat suitability indices currently under development by the Habitat Effects Branch.  This instrument will contribute to research that will (1) synthesize habitat quantity, quality, or arrangement (stressors), and (2) quantitatively relate  these habitat alteration stressors to fish, shellfish, or wildlife (responses), thus supporting the Altered Habitat Research Plan's APM 5 (Report characterizing relationships of between abundance, quality, and arrangement of various habitat types ad selected biotic assessment endpoints in coastal  systems) and APM 6 (Synthesized quantitative species-habitat relationships suitable for developing regional habitat-based bio-criteria for shorelines, lakes and estuaries).  As dissolved oxygen level is an assessment endpoint for the Watershed Diagnostics Branch, the AUV, equipped with the  fast-response dissolved oxygen sensor, will be a valuable research tool for this branch as well (APM- Report on the sensitivity of food web responses to nutrient loading coastal systems). In addition, the potential exists for the AUV to be used as a tool for large scale monitoring and assessment  efforts in a range of habitats in support of the Coastal Assessment (Goal 8) and Aquatic Stressors (Goal 2) research efforts. Furthermore, we can conceive potential uses of the AUV at Gulf Ecology Division (GED), Mid-Continent Ecology Division (MED), Western Ecology Division (WED) and by EPA  regions and partners.   General Specifications: o	The AUV must be easily lifted by two people, deployable from a small-craft or from shore, and therefore must be small and light (see specific specifications list). o	The AUV must be modular in design allowing simple assembly and disassembly and be  comprised mainly of commercial off-the-shelf components. o	All of the source code for the AUV's instrumentation control and navigation software, and detailed schematics of all electronic circuits must be provided to enable field troubleshooting.  A troubleshooting guide is also required. o	The  modular hull sections must be lightweight and constructed of materials immune or highly resistant to corrosion.  All pressure containers must be sealed with o-rings. o	The AUV must be fully operational in water temperatures ranging from -1.6?C to 35?C and remain unharmed for storage, and  operational for testing in air temperatures ranging from -10?C to 45?C.   o	A connection to the central processing computer must be externally available through an underwater connector. o	A graphical user interface (GUI) must be provided for planning of safe mission waypoints and to monitor the  mission progress.  The navigation planning and monitoring must be facilitated with electronic charting software that allows input and explicitly accounts for magnetic variation. o	The AUV must be capable of remotely accepting mission plans and updates from a computer.  The AUV must be capable of  telemetering positional information and scientific data, to the remote computer. o	The AUV should have a secondary transponder (i.e., pinger locator device) in case of loss of AUV.		 o	The AUV operations must be independent of acoustic positioning systems.	 o	When the AUV is transiting underwater  between waypoints, navigation is to be performed using dead-reckoning algorithms or preferably via an inertial navigation system.  Dead reckoning is to be performed using algorithms that compensate for currents and account for intermittent GPS updates. o	While the AUV is at the surface, a  geographic position is to be measurable using WAAS-enabled or differential GPS. o	The AUV package must include rugged shipping containers for all components. o	The AUV package must include a corrosion-resistant equipment stand that supports the AUV during setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting  activities, and for secure storage on the deck of a ship. o	The AUV package must include an expendable items spares kit for field repairs (connectors, o-rings, wiring harnesses, replacement fins or shrouds if easily damaged during deployment and recovery operations, etc.), and include a complete  parts list of all commercial off-the shelf and custom AUV components.  A list of part numbers and pricing must be included for all custom AUV components. o	AUV demonstrations by the Contractor must be organized and conducted by the Contractor in coordination with the government representatives.   For these demonstrations, only the costs associated with the government representatives' meals, incidental expenses, lodging, and the transportation will be incurred by the government.  All other costs of the demonstrations are to be incurred by the Contractor.   o	Post-award AUV on-site services  shall include training on all AUV hardware and software systems. o	The operational performance and specification compliance of the candidate AUV must be fully demonstrated to U.S. EPA's AED scientists prior to acceptance of the AUV and associated payment in-full. o	Software must meet the  requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Minimum Specifications: o	Length: 1.5-3 m o	Weight:   < 100 kg o	Depth rating:  > 100 m o	Sustained (mission) speed:  > 3 knots o	Endurance at mission speed: > 6 hours or 18 nautical miles o	Re-power: via externally rechargeable batteries  (through externally accessible connector) and/or easy (< 15 minute) battery swap procedure o	Navigation:  GPS and inertial navigation, without transponders o	Control Interface:  Vehicle is capable of total autonomy, and provides user-friendly ability to pre-determine vehicle path in 3D by lat/lons  as well as by depth and altitude, including a capability for oscillation patterns with depth/altitude.  Knowledge of specialized computer languages not required. o	Sensor suite and internally recorded parameters:  date, time, conductivity, temperature, depth, altitude, dissolved oxygen, latitude,  longitude, heading, speed, battery voltage, and scaled images (see camera requirements below)  o	Maximum equilibration time for all sensors, including dissolved oxygen:  0.3 seconds. o	Minimum data rate for internally recording the above parameters:  1.0 hertz (exception: camera, see  below). o	Camera requirements: 480 line video camera at video rate or (preferred) high-resolution (> 1.0 mega-pixel) still camera at 0.5 hertz or better.  Camera must include scaling system (parallel lasers, stereoscopy, etc).  All items shall be delivered to the U.S. EPA, 27 Tarzwell Drive,  Narragansett, RI 02882, no later than 90 days after award.  FOB point shall be destination.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS MODIFIED AS FOLLOWS:

DELETE SEE NUMBERED NOTE 22 IN ITS ENTIRETY.


THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY – The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the National Center for Rural Health Works (NCRHWks) at Oklahoma State University, Department of Agricultural Economics, 508 Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK  74078, to continue development of a national information center (Rural Health Works) that will provide analysis, technical assistance, and information to policymakers, researchers, State Offices of Rural Health, Cooperative Extension Service and rural communities on the importance of health care services to the local economy.  

The focus of this project has been to (1) train State-level officials in how to measure the economic impact of health care services (IMPLAN), (2) conduct analysis of the economic impact that selected health policies have on the local economy, (3) conduct a full community engagement/planning process and (4) help providers identify new service opportunities that was developed by the Oklahoma State University.  Most States have participated in these training workshops. The Government intends on using the lessons learned from this successful project on a national basis. 

The program originated through the Extension Program at Oklahoma State University (OSU) and has also been maintained and further developed through the Extension Program at OSU.  OSU has provided the NCRHWks activities and products to Oklahoma rural communities for the past 25-30 years and continues to provide them each year.  The OK program was the original basis of the NCRHWks program; it was modeled and the templates and sample technical reports were developed by OSU at their own expense and became the pilot of the NCRHWks original initiative in 1998.  OSU has continued to develop and provide additional products, as well as providing technical expertise, training, and advice to the other States in their statewide NCRHWks program development.  The OK program through OSU Extension has become the National Center for Rural Health Works.  OSU has the expertise and trained staff to provide the training and technical expertise to other States, and to continue their development of new health impact areas. 

The anticipated period of performance for this project is for one (1) year with 2 twelve month option periods.  The statutory authority is FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2) and 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements without substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Oklahoma State University developed the models and the database that RHW uses.   Any other organization would have to duplicate the database that has been developed by Oklahoma State University at their expense.  A Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared by the Government.  Any interested party may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by submitting a capability statement in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the services without incurring substantial cost duplication within 15 days from publication of this notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A draft Statement of Work is attached for informational purposes only.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The NAICS Code is 541990.

<DESC>The NWBC offers small business researchers the opportunity to have access to special tabulations from the US Census Bureau of women-owned employer establishments from 1997-2001.  The NWBC willfund one or two special analysis projects, looking for creative ideas from the research community focused on: changes over time, special populations, or innovative theories about business growth or challenges.

STATEMENT OF WORK – 
SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF 
CENSUS DATASET 


BACKGROUND

The National Women’s Business Council is a bi-partisan public policy advisory body created to serve as an independent source of advice to the President, Congress, and others on economic issues of importance to women business owners.  The Council is committed to:
•	Conducting research on issues of importance to women business owners and their organizations; 
•	Communicating these findings widely; 
•	Connecting the women’s business community to public policy makers; and 
•	Providing a platform for change to expand and improve opportunities for women business owners and their enterprises.

Through an ongoing agreement with the Census Bureau, the NWBC receives custom tabulations on the number and growth of women-owned employer firms on an annual basis. The tabulations received thus far look specifically at employer establishments in existence in 1997 (the most recent Census year) and how they have changed (in number and employment) in each year since. We have produced two Issues in Brief report looking at changes in survival and employment among all women-owned firms, from 1997 to 2000 and 1997 to 2001, as well as five Issues in Brief focused on 1997 to 2000 trends among firms owned by women of color. Please visit our web site (www.nwbc.gov)  to review these reports. 

This dataset offers a rich opportunity for researchers, and we would like to alert the academic and researcher community of the availability of this dataset – and to underwrite one or two small analysis projects utilizing the data.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The successful bidder will focus on a discrete trend or hypothesis and, utilizing the tables available from the Census Bureau, produce a concise and actionable analysis (see Attachment A for description of dataset and variables). Topics focused on regions, changes over time, or specific populations (industry or ethnicity) are especially encouraged. Creativity in proposed area of focus will play a large role in the contract award.

Task Number One:	Review available data and recommend specific areas for analysis
Task Number Two:	Data analysis.
Task Number Three:	Development of findings and preparation of draft and final report. 

PROGRESS REPORTS
The contractor shall be required to provide a report detailing the progress made on the project and identifying and addressing problems encountered. This progress report shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (“COTR”). At the end of one month, the contractor shall first provide a preliminary report to the COTR showing the recommended analysis and analysis plan, including method and design. The contractor shall also include in the report a timely response to any questions or clarification of any points raised by the COTR about the data, or analysis method and design. At monthly intervals from the date of contract award, the contractor shall provide interim reports on the progress and shall also provide a timely response to any questions or clarification on any points raised by the COTR about the interim reports. Monthly payments will be made to the contractor up to 80% of the contract value. At least one draft version of the report shall be supplied to the COTR in advance of the final deliverable. The final report must take into consideration comments received from government employees and the COTR. The final 20% of the contract value will be paid upon delivery of the final report, as noted below.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
Task	Time
Kick-off meeting	Day 1
Analysis recommendation report	Day 30
Interim report 	Day 60
Draft report 	Day 90
Approval of final report	Day 100
Delivery	Day 120
The period of performance of this contract is approximately 4 months from date of award. Timeline may vary based on nature of analysis proposed.

DELIVERABLES  
The contractor shall provide the NWBC with 50 hard copies of the final report, as well as electronic versions in PDF and Word formats to facilitate posting on the NWBC website. The contractor shall submit the copies directly to the National Women’s Business Council, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 210, Washington, DC  20024.

REQUEST FOR QUOTATION
The successful contractor will respond to this request by:
•	Providing five (5) copies of a succinct proposal of no more than 10 pages (including resumes and other addenda) and cost estimate for the aforementioned tasks. The cost estimate should be separate from the technical proposal and should include all costs associated with the project, including any travel, delivery or other miscellaneous costs.
•	Responding directly and clearly to each of the items in the statement of work.
•	Offering a creative analysis of one or more trends, populations or issues covered by the referenced dataset.
•	Demonstrating relevant past experience and competency related to the contract tasks, and ability to meet the technical requirements of the project.
•	The National Women’s Business Council is especially interested in receiving quotes from women-owned businesses.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is market research in support of a potential contract for Thunderbird Airshow Production Services (TAPS) for a turnkey audio, visual, and sound production presentation to augment and integrate with Thunderbird air demonstrations that will significantly improve their entertainment value and mission accomplishment.  The U.S. Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron, the Thunderbirds, performs precision aerial maneuvers demonstrating the capabilities of the Air Force high performance aircraft to people throughout the world.  The squadron exhibits the professional qualities the Air Force develops in the people who fly, maintain and support these aircraft.  The Thunderbirds were officially activated June 1, 1953 as the 3600 Air Demonstration Team at Luke Air Force Base.  Their first aircraft was the straight-winged F-84G Thunderjet, a combat fighter-bomber that had seen action in Korea.  Early in 1955, the team transitioned to the swept-winged F-84F Thunderstreak.  After flying several different aircraft, the Thunderbirds transitioned to the F-16A demonstrating the Air Force's front-line fighter capabilities.  The Thunderbirds air demonstration is a mix of formation flying and solo routines.  The four-aircraft diamond formation demonstrates the training and precision of Air Force pilots, while the solo aircraft highlight the maximum capabilities of the F-16.  The team is comprised of 130 Airmen who work together to represent the U.S. Air Force.  Additional information regarding the Thunderbirds can be found at: www.airforce.com/thunderbirds. 

The pilots perform approximately 30 maneuvers in a demonstration.  The entire show, including ground and air, runs about an hour and fifteen minutes.  The season lasts from March to November, with the winter months used to train new members.  The team performs no more the 88 air demonstrations each year and has never canceled a demonstration due to maintenance difficulty.  More than 310 million people in all 50 states and more than 66 foreign countries have seen the Thunderbird jets in more than 3,944 aerial demonstrations.  

The Thunderbirds perform up to 11 different types of shows (type of show depends on multiple variables, such as weather, airspace restrictions, etc).  The production show shall be presented at scheduled Thunderbird shows.  As an example, the current Thunderbird schedule can be found at the following website:  http://www.airforce.com/thunderbirds/scheduletext.htm.

The scope of this requirement is for the vendor to provide the full range of show production services.  This includes such activities as producing, programming, operating and presenting an audio, visual, and sound show that provides an exciting, energetic display that integrates the Thunderbird air show into a force multiplier to educate, entertain and inspire the spectators.  This includes assessment tools to measure the show quality, spectator satisfaction and recommended changes.  In addition, this includes providing all plant, labor, materials, operation, coordination, and transportation necessary to set-up, tear-down, and relocate all audiovisual equipment used in the production services, to allow the Thunderbird team to focus on the flying aspect of the air demonstration show.  The contractor shall be responsible for generation of a production show, which includes, but is not limited to: developing a project timeline, script from concept, storyline/scene design, and all technical systems (as well as designs) for lighting, audio, video display, and set.  Production services include the execution of plans and designs required to assemble and construct the physical components of the Thunderbird production, to include set pieces and props, image display programming, assembly of cast and crew (if any), and integration of all production elements through personnel and equipment rehearsals.  The contractor will have overall responsibility of all planning and execution of pre-production, production, and event production services, based upon guidance and direction from the Thunderbird Project Manager.

The multimedia presentation must deliver a professional “on air network look.”  The contractor must deliver clear video images that are capable of being viewed by spectators up to 500 feet away, and must provide concert quality sound coverage to spectators covering a crowd area of at least 6000 feet.


Interested parties having the resources and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements are invited to provide a company capability statement that clearly demonstrates their ability to fulfill such requirements.  The Government requests that interested parties submit commercial market and company information via e-mail to Captain David Huber, Contracting Officer, 99 CONS/LGCC.  The e-mail address is david.huber@nellis.af.mil.  Please attempt to limit responses to 15 pages in length and, at a minimum, address the following:

Also, please describe your ability to set-up, tear-down, and transport all equipment.  Please describe the ease of assembly of all equipment at airshows.  For example, if using video screens, how long do they take to assemble and tear-down?  Are they easily disassembled and reassembled so that they are not obstructive to spectators as they watch other airshow events?  If a typical airshow lasts from 9:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m., and the Thunderbird performance begins approximately 3:00 p.m., how would you set up/tear down your equipment to prevent it from being an obstruction to people viewing the airshow throughout the day?  Can your equipment be easily moved, disassembled, etc. to allow people freely view the rest of the airshow activities before the Thunderbird performance?

6.	The Government contemplates awarding a “phased” contract, where the contractor would compile and “fine-tune” the production over the life of the contract (i.e., in distinct phases, as identified by individual Contract Line Item Numbers [CLINs]).  For example, the base-year contract effort might contain the following CLINS:

0001  PHASE 1, Master Production Design and Schedule.  The contractor shall provide a TAPS master production design, to include theatrical design and support plan, and schedule for TAPS activities.  The Thunderbird Project Manager shall approve TAPS master production design, theatrical design, and support plan.  Submission of Phase 1 documents is due no later than 30-days after contract award .  Government approval of TAPS master production design, theatrical design, and support plan is due no later than 15-days after submission by the contractor.

0002  PHASE 2, Acceptance Flight Presentation.  The contractor shall demonstrate TAPS pre-production and production capabilities by presenting full TAPS services at an acceptance flight, currently envisioned for Nellis AFB NV in February/March 2006.  The Thunderbird Project Manager shall approve TAPS services demonstrated at the acceptance flight.  The contractor shall adjust any pre-production or production services as directed by the Thunderbird Project Manager prior to commencement of Phase 3 activities.

0003  PHASE 3, Full Production Services.  The contractor shall conduct TAPS services at scheduled Thunderbird airshows and other events as scheduled.  The Thunderbird Project Manager and contractor shall negotiate Thunderbird airshows the contractor shall support.  The contractor shall be given at least 30-days prior notice to perform at an airshow.

This phased contract shall be firm-fixed price.  It is envisioned that each contract year (Government is contemplating base-year plus four one-year options) shall have these three CLINs.  Please provide feedback on this envisioned contract structure.  Specifically, are “phases” appropriate for this effort?  Do you have suggestions for a better contract structure?  Is a firm-fixed price contract most appropriate for this effort?  Can PHASE 3 be priced “per airshow”?  That is, if Thunderbird airshow schedules from the past three years were presented to you, could you use that information to sufficiently compile a per-show price for future airshows?

7.	Please provide to us any questions/comments you have about the envisioned TAPS requirements.  For example, are there ambiguities, redundancies, or hard to understand statements?  

Responses should be submitted no later than 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Tuesday, July 19, 2005.

This is a request for information only, and no solicitation is issued at this time.  Submission of any information in response to this request for information is completely voluntary, and shall not constitute a fee to the Government.

Please direct any questions to Captain David Huber at (702) 652-3366 or david.huber@nellis.af.mil.

<DESC>Geodesic Dome Array Antenna with Digital Beam Forming For Distress Alerting Satellite Service General Information This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis.  The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify sources of commercial and manufactured items that meet Air Force requirements.<br> This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. There will be no reimbursement for the information provided.  AFRL is considering competing select service providers and carries special requirements as defined, but not limited to, selection criteria noted in this synopsis.  Please mail or e-mail qualification statements by ***DATE*** to either POC identified below. <br> Description<br> The Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate, Antenna Technology Branch (AFRL/SNHA), Hanscom Research Site (HRS), is seeking capable sources to perform detailed design, implementation and integration tasks, in support of a current design concept, for an outside agency. Anticipated deliverables include a ground-based antenna and all accompanying articles.  The technologies and/or technology applications will be considered for system development efforts beginning in Fiscal Year 2006, with an approximated 36 month delivery schedule. <br> Distress Alerting Satellite Service<br> The Distress Alerting Satellite Service (DASS) will be used to provide civilian search and rescue (SAR) personnel with the capability to quickly identify and accurately locate persons in need of rescue services.  Some noted aspects of the DASS architecture and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) include: <br> -	406 MHz distress beacon (user segment) <br> -	SAR "bent pipe" transponder (space segment) on BPS BLKs IIR/IIF/II constellations<br> -	Ground stations receive, process, and distribute distress, alert, and location data from GPS satellites to the SAR network <br><br> The SAR transponder on each of the GPS satellites is a "bent pipe" repeater that relays the 406 MHz beacon signals to the DASS ground stations via an L-band down link frequency (1544.9MHz).  The ground station antenna for DASS must meet following basic specs: <br> -	Down link frequency: 1544.8-1545.0 MHz (Center frequency: 1544.9 MHz) <br> -	G/T=8 dB/K<br> -	Data rate: 15 kbps per beam, 8 beams per site<br> -	Satellite payload transmitter: EIRP > 15 dBW over the entire earth<br> -	Polarization will be left-hand or right-hand circular (CP) <br> -	Antenna will be receive-only. No transmit capability required. <br> Geodesic Dome Array Antenna<br> AFRL/SNHA performed a preliminary ground station antenna architecture study and concluded that a Geodesic Dome Array Antenna (GDAA), with digital beam forming (DBF), is optimal for the DASS.  Studies have shown that a single GDAA could accommodate 8 simultaneous beams, in a hemispherical coverage. The GDAA is essentially a spherical array, with curved surfaces approximated by flat facets, or subarrays.  Each subarray, in the proposed concept, consists of a multi-layer panel and digital receiver at each element.  A typical panel structure is envisioned to have layers for radiating elements, RF calibration, 90 degree hybrids for circular polarization (CP), local oscillator (LO) signals, and power distribution.  The digital receivers will primarily consist of a front-end low noise amplifier (LNA) and an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. Digital data from each receiver may be processed in one of two ways: (1) Partial processing at the subarray level, to form eight subarray beams, for subsequent combination in a central processor to form the eight GD beams.  (2) Complete processing done in a single central processor to form the eight GD beams.  In either case each of the eight GD beams will be assigned to a visible GPS satellite by an antenna resource management computer.  Detailed DBF parameters will be specifically addressed after potential integrators have been identified. <br> Capabilities & Efforts<br> AFRL seeks integrators that will utilize GPS commercial off the shelf (COTS) components as material solutions where available, while maintaining the ability to manufacture specialized elements (i.e. multi-layer array panels).  Due to the short suspense, AFRL will entertain only those providers with previous experience in related (as deemed appropriate by AFRL) antenna fabrication and DBF projects.  Responses are highly encouraged by those service providers with mature planar phased array antenna manufacturing technologies and DBF network implementation. The potential effort will include: participating in, planning, and conducting system design, prototype fabrication, testing, and delivery. The efforts may also include, but are not limited to, technology demonstrations, evaluation programs and field exercises; develop test plan documentation; analysis, evaluation, and documentation of  technical data. The selected contractor will be expected to provide technical project planning and coordination; prepare and present formal and informal briefings; attend technical meetings for the purpose of providing technical expertise.  In addition, the contractor will be expected to develop, maintain, and document an appropriate GDAA cost model. <br> Responses<br> Where applicable and appropriate, white papers should directly compare and contrast capabilities with current COTS items or known developmental efforts with respect to improvements, limitations, weight, size, cost, power density, capacity, duration, dynamic range of performance, ease of production and use.  Specific performance data and materials compatibility information should be provided.  Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement.  Offerors having the technical skills and capabilities to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought.  Interested offerors should address in their written response whether they can fulfill this requirement.  Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status such as disadvantaged, 8(a), HUB Zone, Woman Owned, Minority Owned, and/or Veteran Owned, teaming partners and/or major subcontractors or prime.  Responses should address how the Offeror can meet any part or all of the above requirements and should not exceed three (3) pages in total. AFRL will review all submittals to this posting, respond appropriately, and make recommendations regarding ability to serve and perform in the government's recommended capacity.  Recommendations will also be made for future capabilities briefings, between government personnel and potential service providers.  Such correspondence may include site visits, in order to gain first-hand knowledge of competence.  While all responses to a future Request for Proposal will be accepted and reviewed, ARFL does not wish to dissipate resources, both government and contractor. <br> References<br> B. Tomasic et al.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Marketing and Regulatory Programs Business Services (MRPBS) National Invasive Species Council, has a requirement for a contractor to help the National Invasive Species Council develop a three year invasive species action plan.  This action plan will identify the most strategic and effective priorities for implementation by USDA agencies in the context of the Revised National Invasive Species Management Plan.  The contractor will work with the USDA Senior Invasive Species Coordinator, representatives of seven USDA agencies, representatives of the National Invasive Species Council staff and members of the Invasive Species Council Advisory Committee.  

The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain the services of a consultant that can facilitate the workshops and attend meetings to help develop the invasive species action plan.  The work to develop the plan will take part in three phases. All the meetings and workshops that complete the three phases will be held in Washington DC and are estimated to begin in October 2005 and be completed by May 2006.

The first phase of the action plan will entail attending meetings and interviewing participants.  The contractor will meet with the core planning team to review and assess the relevancy of other programs at the federal government level and perform structural analyses of the interview findings.  Phase one will require approximately ten (10) days on site. Phase two will consist of a series of three (3) workshops, each two days long. The final outcome of the workshops will be the collective design by the participants of a collobrative national invasive species 3 year action plan. Phase three will include one (1)  – two (2) day meeting to establish a steering committee.

The contractor will be responsible for designing the agendas of the workshops and engaging participants in a focused and open dialogue with computer support.  The contractor will be required to deliver real time the products of the deliberations of the participants such as tables of ideas, clarification of the meanings of those ideas, prioritization of idea statements, and relational maps displaying graphically the influences among the priority ideas.

For prior acquisitions of a similar nature the Department of Agriculture has worked with the company CWA, LTD incorporating the Cogniscope method and Delphi study.  The Cogniscope method is a scientific method designed and used to manage complex issues.  The Cogniscope process defines and resolves complex issues by engaging stakeholders systematically and collaboratively in discovering relationships among the factors relevant to the issue.  The Delphi study is an interactive survey of stakeholders with diverse perspectives, for the purpose of converging on a consensus perspective on a complex issue. 

Contractors are asked to submit information regarding their company’s technical capabilities, credentials, and experience to perform this type of consulting service.  The contractor can provide the information about their company’s technical capabilities, credentials, and experience using either the Cogniscope method and Delphi study or a similar approach.

In accordance with the socioeconomic goals of the USDA, we are specifically interested in doing a set aside for a service disabled veteran company, however, this does not preclude any company from submitting a response as we will take all information into consideration when determining how to proceed with this acquisition. 

Responses to this Sources Sought are due by Wednesday, July 27, 2005. You may send your response to the attention of Corinne Nygren by mail, fax, or email.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for an upcoming requirement of DMSP Support for the DOC/NOAA/ NESDIS/NPOESS project.  All responses must have substantial documentation that addresses the requirements in this announcement in order for the Government to determine if your company is able to do the work required.  This is an on-going effort and no down time will be acceptable for any of the segments.  All information must be sent to Ms. Marlene S. Quade, Contracting Officer, 8455 Colesville Road, Ste 1450, Silver Spring, MD  20910.  
The Department of Defense requires an enduring and survivable capability to provide the United States military with accurate worldwide weather information. This capability is provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), which collects and disseminates global visible and infrared cloud data in support of worldwide operations and high priority programs.  The global data must be provided in a timely manner to users at the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and Fleet Numerical Meteorological Operations Center (FNMOC).  The DoD also needs a capability to collect and disseminate other specialized meteorological, terrestrial, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical data to users.  Users require these services through all levels of conflict in which they are capable of surviving.  DMSP consists of a space segment, link segment, ground segment, and user segment.  
Each DMSP satellite has a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar orbit at an altitude of 830km above the surface of the earth. The visible and infrared sensors (OLS) collect images across a 3000km swath, providing global coverage twice per day. The combination of day/night and dawn/dusk satellites allows monitoring of global information such as clouds every 6 hours. The microwave imager (MI) and sounders (T1, T2) cover one half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the equatorial region once per day. The space environment sensors (J4, M, IES) record along-track plasma densities, velocities, composition and drifts. There are currently 6 operational DMSP satellites on orbit: two are designated primary, two are secondary, one is partially operational, and one is reserved for testing only.  The DMSP mission is expected to continue until 2019.  
The DMSP ground system network is an earth based command, telemetry, and data processing system providing all functions for the state of health maintenance, communications, sensor payload data retrieval and dissemination, and launch and early orbit support for the DMSP constellation. The ground segment consists of the Suitland Operations Control Center (SOCC), Suitland, MD; Environmental Satellite Operations Center (ESOC), Schriever AFB, CO; the Payload Integration Test Facility (PITF), Vandenberg AFB, CA; AFSCN tracking stations at Hawaii, Thule Greenland, New Boston, NH; NOAA tracking stations in Fairbanks, AK, and Wallops, VA; user sites at AFWA, Omaha, NE, and FNMOC, at Monterey, CA.  Other operational support nodes include Onizuka AFB, CA and the DMSP SPO at Los Angeles AFB, CA.  Future operational nodes may include McMurdo Ground Station, Antarctica, and the Svalsat Ground Station in Svalbard, Norway.


GROUND SEGMENT REQUIREMENTS
Support for the ground system will include hardware and software component supply, repair, test, maintenance, upgrade, and technical support.  System upgrades, which include new technologies, software releases, and commercial off the shelf (COTS) components, shall be integrated into existing legacy systems in such a manner as to ensure requirements for timely and enduring data delivery are met.   Current software/OS consist of:  Open VMS, Windows NT/2000, Unix, Oracle, MS SQL, PVWAVE, EPOCH, and What’s Up Gold.  Programming languages consist of Fortran, C++, Ada, and PERL.  Network protocols consist of TCP/IP and DECNET.  

The Command Control and Communication (C3) system uses COTS and custom built hardware and software to provide satellite S-Band (2207.5—2252.5 MHz) command up-link and data down-link capability.  This includes equipment such as the Telemetry and Command System (TCS), Dual Decommutator and Command processor (DDCP), System Communications Unit (SCU), ARTS Interface Unit (AIU), Aiken Switch, and Data Quality Monitor (DQM).  The TCS is a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) platform running custom code that maintains satellite telemetry and command databases, generates satellite loads and commands, archives data and logs for engineering analysis, provides information for display on operations consoles and controls overall ground system function.    The DDCP is a custom designed device that provides decommutation and time-tagging of DMSP real-time and stored payload telemetry and outputs data via TCP/IP to the TCS via custom developed code.  It performs DMSP satellite command and load formatting, authentication, and echo check verification as well as provides KG control. Command and control, telemetry, and mission data up-link and down-link flows through cryptographic processors including KG-61 and KG-144.  The SCU is a custom designed device that provides point-to-point and broadcast inter-site communications via a TDM scheme and specialized formatting to ensure the reliable delivery of DMSP mission, telemetry, and commanding data between DMSP ground locations. The AIU is a modified, commercially available command processor that provides a direct interface with AFSCN tracking sites.  The Aiken Switch is a 20+ year old legacy component that provides switching and routing of DMSP DOMSAT links, SCUs, and TCS strings.  The input and output of all DMSP commanding and telemetry routes through and is controlled by the Aiken Switch.  DQM is a Windows XP based custom coded tool that allows users and operators to monitor data quality as it is down-linked.  DQM will provide the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) with a robust switching capability for multiple DOMSAT streams for its ingest processors.  The DMSP ground system network provides interconnectivity between all sites, users, and operations centers with TCP/IP based communications systems, DOMSAT links (3.2256 Mbps), and T1 connections.  The network is presently divided into three subsystems:  Communications, Switching, and Processing.  Many network components are integrated into more then one subsystem.  DMSP C3 support shall include in-depth comprehension of the DMSP C3 system, from operator interface to satellite command, control, and data recovery through to data receipt, quality monitoring, and ingest at AFWA and FNMOC.  DMSP C3 support will also include sustainment engineering for mission unique software, independent test analyses and problem isolation.  

The Government requires Level 1, 2, and 3 for depot level support on all operational and spare hardware.  The Government requires a ground segment mission reliability of 99.8%.  The ground segment operational availability rate will be 99.7% with a mean time between critical failures of the ground segment greater than 328 hours.  The mean time to repair the ground segment shall be less than 1 hour and the maximum corrective maintenance time of all repair actions shall not exceed 3 hours.  AFWA and FNMOC shall receive 100% of global smooth data within 10 minutes of downlink, and 100% of find data within 4 hours of downlink.  


SERVICES INFORMATION

Required services will include technical support to all DMSP equipment at any site.  Technical support includes development, integration, and preventive and corrective maintenance. DMSP will need supply storage at a Contractor depot location for all depot items.  The Contractor shall furnish all facilities, parts, materials, data, equipment and services.  In order to meet the timely data delivery requirements, the Program will require on-call emergency technical support to any DMSP ground segment site, system engineering and analysis of ground segment equipment, configuration management, and feasibility studies for system enhancements and modifications.   The Program also requires sustaining engineering, system performance analysis, and test support.  Because of the use of legacy equipment, component and operational system modifications will be needed.  Modifications will include design, develop, fabricate, test, produce, manufacture, install modification kits and update all required technical documentation.  Support for the DMSP ground segment will include interaction and in-depth knowledge of the AFSCN, access to AFSCN sites, and support at AFSCN technical meetings.  DMSP support includes launch and early orbit support for DMSP spacecraft, providing ground system expertise and on-site support to the operations command center in Suitland MD.  Interaction with government and other contractors, as well as independent work, for launch and early orbit anomaly resolution related to the DMSP ground system will be required.  In addition, the contractor shall be able to send and receive equipment to CONUS and international locations, work with foreign governments and contractors to track, inventory, and/or transfer custody of equipment.  A SECRET clearance is necessary for this effort.  Services will include part-time availability of a knowledgeable engineer with access to Schriever AFB, CO, and a full-time engineer in Suitland, MD.  Engineering labor categories include software, system, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, and quality assurance.  Other labor categories may include scientist, program management, administrative, and logistics.  DMSP requires investigating new technologies, software releases, and commercial off the shelf (COTS) technologies, and then testing and integrating these new acquisitions into the current system.  The Contractor will be expected to develop a long term system engineering and sustainment plan for DMSP C3 and provide the government with recommendations and milestones to sustain the ground network.  All hardware and software upgrades will meet the Department of Commerce’s Information Technology security requirements.   

Steps are near completion to begin replacement of the System Communications Units (SCUs) within the DMSP ground system.  These steps included tasks needed to identify, test, and demonstrate potential commercial equipment that can enable NOAA to potentially transform its data handling of DMSP bit stream data to an IP switched packet network.  It also included the associated design work to integrate the selected replacement device into the ground system with the least possible impact.  Work to procure, install, integrate and test the SCU replacement devices within the ground system will need to be started during this effort.

<SUBJECT>J -- Maintenance & Repair of Schindler Elevators
<DESC>Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) on behalf of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, Mississippi (AFRH-G) intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with the Schindler Elevator Corporation for the acquisition of maintenance and repairs for Schindler Elevators (1,2,5 & 6) providing vertical transportation for Building 1 at the AFRH-G.  This contract will be a base plus five option periods.

Schindler Elevator Corporation shall provide for maintenance, repairs, expeditious removal of entrapped passengers and a comprehensive preventative maintenance scheme insuring emergency operation of cars 5 and 6.  Cars 5 and 6 are critical as their larger size allows for Fire Evacuation and Code 7 emergency responses of residents restricted to a litter, gurney of large motorized chairs.

This company is the only provider of the warranty repairs, maintenance, and proprietary diagnostic services required within a reasonable area able to react to normal and emergency calls efficiently.  Schindler Elevator Corporation possesses proprietary tools of the trade that are not available to other elevator companies.

Therefore, a sole source to Schindler Elevator Corporation is intended for this task, as no other sources have access to the proprietary tools that are necessary to service the elevators and ensure the safety of the residents of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, Mississippi

No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 15 days after publication of this notice.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement or functional equivalent, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Schindler Elevator Corporation.

Interested parties are requested to submit responses electronically to Gina Huffman at ntprocurement@bpd.treas.gov   Or, responses may be addressed to Gina Huffman, Bureau of the Public Debt, Division of Procurement, 200 Third Street, UNB 4th Floor, Parkersburg, WV  26101.

LOGCAP is a program of the U.S. Army to use civilian contractors to provide the U.S. troops with an additional means to adequately support the current and programmed force by performing selected services in wartime and other operations, i.e. Humanitarian A ssistance, Disaster Relief, Peace Keeping, Peace Enforcement, and Major/Minor Conflict. The principal objective of LOGCAP is to provide Combat Support and Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) augmentation to Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) and Army Service Compon ent Commanders (ASCCs) (COCOM/ASCC), primarily during COCOM contingency operations, throughout the full range of military operations to include reconstitution and replenishment, within reasonable cost.   Planned changes in the Armys force structure could have an impact on future LOGCAP requirements.  LOGCAP services have been authorized by the Department of the Army for use in supporting other military services, coalition and/or multinational forces, and other governmental/non-governmental agencies. Because of the potential need for additional contingency capability and the benefits of changing some elements of the current contract based on lessons learned, the Government proposes to solicit for additional contractors for future LOGCAP requirements. The Government will present some different approaches for industry comment.  These preliminary approaches include soliciting for additional contractors to augment the current contract, competing for all new contracts, competing for the functional requireme nts worldwide, competing for global contractors who will get work anywhere, and/or competing for regional contractors.  We will also look at whether worldwide and regional planning involving multiple LOGCAP contractors should be done separately by an indep endent contractor, or accomplished by one or more LOGCAP contractors.  Any new contracts that might result will be for new LOGCAP requirements after contract award.   Any potential solicitation and contracts that may result will require the contractor or contractors to be capable of providing LOGCAP support services.  Any resulting contract(s) would be for up to 10 years, with work distributed possibly among no more tha n three contractors.  Because of the requirement to work with classified information, contractors must be able to obtain a U.S Facility Clearance to the SECRET level in accordance with (IAW) Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5220.22 of the National In dustrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM).  This SECRET level clearance also applies to affiliates, team members, and subcontractors if they have access to classified information.   A contractor would be required to execute support in all types of environments on multiple task orders, simultaneously, in support of several dozen to tens of thousands troops per task order in the following areas:  	Supply Operations.  Class I (Rations and Water), Class II (Organizational Clothing and Equipment and Administrative Supplies), Class III (Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants - both Bulk and Package), Class IV (Construction Materials), Class V (Ammunition - to i nclude Ammunition Supply Point Operations), Class VI (Personal Demand Items), Class VII (Major Items), Class VIII (Medical Supplies), and Class IX (Repair Parts- to include Requisition, Receipt, Stora ge, Issue, Accountability, and Materiel Management). 	Field Services.  Clothing Exchange and Bath (CEB), Laundry, Clothing Repair, Food Service, Mortuary Affairs, Sanitation to include Hazardous Waste, Billeting, Facilities Management, Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR), Information Management, Postal Opera tions, and Administration such as Personnel Support and Banking Support.        Other Operations/Services.  Maintenance Table of Distribution and Allowances (TDA) Equipment to include Automatic Data Processing Equipment (ADPE)/Office Equipment, and Tactical Equipment or components thereof - Unit through General Support (GS) Lev el; Transportation (Movement Control, Cargo Transfer, Motor Pool, Port/Ocean Terminal Operations, Line/Local Haul, Arrival/Departure Air Control Group (A/DACG)), to include all aspects of aviation; Medical Services (Supply, Maintenance, Transportation, Adm inistration, and Vector Control Services); Engineering/Construction (Bed Down and Facilities Construction/Renovation and Repair, Site Preparation, Facilities Engineering, Road/Bridge/Rail/Runway/Port/Pipeline/ Walkway Construction and/or Repair, Temporary Real Property Leasing, and Utilities of Fixed Facilities Repair/Upgrade);  Signal (Telephone Cable Repair, Cable, Wire, and Antenna Installation, and Access to Communication Networks);  Retrograde (Equipment and Materiel); and Power Generation and Distribu tion.  Current Government voucher processing time is 21 calendar days plus contractor time prior to submitting to the Government.  Contractors may incur significant expense prior to Government reimbursement.  Contractors must have the capability to track costs do wn to the subcontract level, and be able to work with foreign suppliers whose systems are not in compliance with U.S. accounting standards.  All contractor invoices are subject to audit by appropriate audit agencies of the US Government. Contractors must have the capability to hire foreign national workers and comply with host country labor laws.  They must also be able to rapidly establish logistics routes to move material to troops. The Government requests your input on these proposed approaches and other information to be presented at an Industry Day on July 26, 2005 at the Baylor Conference Room on Rock Island Arsenal.  It is located on the 3rd floor of building 103.  You must notif y the POC below in advance of your plans to attend the Industry Day on RIA to speed your security processing on the day of the conference.  Fill out an advance registration at this link http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/industryday/registration.doc for submission to our Security Office.

Background:  This integrated software application will help Federal Highway Administration, Western Federal Lands (WFL) meet their strategic goals through improved communication, collaboration and process management of project planning, organizing, executing, and monitoring/controlling activities.  WFL Project Delivery is staffed by nearly 150 managers, engineers, and technicians and currently has more than 120 projects identified in the Project Resource Management System (PRMS) which are currently funded and underway.  Various executive leaders and administrative staff are also occupied by these projects with varying degrees of involvement and interest.  

Description of requirement:  The application needs to be a fully integrated management tool that can help project team members visualize and proactively manage, in real-time, the distinct work tasks across all projects.  Project work tasks need to flow automatically and correctly to all project team members and all interested parties need controlled access to project information.  High-level visibility to project information with drill down capability to review lower level details is needed. Access need be through a real time web-based environment where project team members, partners, and stakeholders can collaborate and accomplish project work activities from anywhere that has access to the web. The application needs to allow users to build detailed project schedules that are made up of a multitude of project activities and can be monitored and controlled to a successful project completion.  It needs to present a simple to use, real–time, Gantt chart interface where users create the schedule and activity inter-relationships.  Once the schedule is initiated, the project team member could “drill down” into the appropriate activity task application.  Activity tasks would be viewed as distinct workspaces complete with instructions, deliverables, scope, schedules, expenditures, as well as relevant documents and files.  Within each activity workspace, the project team member would collaborate through discussion threads on general thoughts or issue tracking. The application must be intuitive and easy to use. WFL is seeking a software solution that can be integrated effectively into its current information technology system (ITS) and will continue to do so as this environment evolves.  Applicable laws and regulations concerning ITS purchases need be fulfilled, such as Section 508 (Subpart 39.2).  Current WFL ITS applications include, but are not limited to: Windows Operating System, Microsoft Office Products, Microsoft Outlook, Open Plan Project Scheduling System and Oracle.  The application needs to flexibly deliver upon the following GENERAL AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS, in a way that is end-user customizable to fit any project management process or organization:  PROJECT PLANNING - Simplify and automate, to the greatest extent possible, the planning of projects including the collection, validation and distribution of project plans and status information, including the capability to track and manage tasks, milestones, timeliness, issues, dependencies, and resources; TASK ACTIVITY SCHEDULING-The software must provide graphic display of project scheduling and progress status.  This display should allow for the use of GANTT, Critical Path, Critical Chain and/or other best-practice scheduling methodologies.  Detail should be developed on at least a task and milestone basis; PROJECT PROFILE- Project profile including at a minimum: a concise description of the project being addressed, the project approach, the benefits to be derived, the project and stakeholder constituency, estimated project costs and resources, estimated timeline, and project approval status; PROJECT COSTING-Detailed projection of project costs including human resources, supplies, A&E consultant and Reimbursable Agreement (RA) agency expenses, and other costs.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for preliminary design and analyses efforts for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Propulsion Subsystem (LPS) propellant tank and nutation analysis efforts for the entire tank set. The tanks will have a Propellant Management Device (PMD) or diaphragm to ensure gas free propellant delivery during mission. The basic objective of this effort is to produce a timely and mature LRO PMD design which will result in only a single nutation drop tower test cycle. The detailed objectives of this effort are twofold:  1. Design an LRO mission specific PMD for the main tank. Since the main tank has not yet been defined, a nominal tank volume of 45,200 cubic inches with a cylinder ID=35.26” will be assumed for the tank. The maximum fill fraction is 98.5% of this volume. A different tank geometry may be selected for analysis with approval of the GSFC COTR. 2. Incorporate the conceptual PMD + tank into a model of the stack (preferably an analytical model) and calculate the nutation time constant for both pre- 3rd stage ignition and post- 3rd stage ignition. 3. Incorporate conceptual nutation control devices into the tank model as required until acceptable nutation performance results. The nutation control device concepts are not allowed to violate the tank shell qualification.  The design may require iteration between 1. - 3. above until the nutation time constant requirements are met. Only drop tower test results of nutation data are currently accepted by the launch vehicle vendor. For a configuration to be considered acceptable based on analytical results there must also be a high degree of confidence that drop tower testing will verify the acceptability of a configuration. This effort must produce detailed data with analyses consistent with both hardware lead times and drop tower test scheduling. The current best estimate need time for producing an initial analysis (not including completed analyses and final report) is 60 calendar days ARO. The PMD design shall be considered property of the Contractor (as is customary) and may not be used by other contractors to produce flight PMD tanks unless a written agreement allowing an information transfer is executed.  The PMD design shall be available for use in NASA programs. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-99. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 541710 and 1,000 respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is required within 3 months ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9  Offers for the items(s) described above are due by July 28, 2005 by 4:30pm E.S.T to Cassandra Atkinson, Bldg. 26/Rm. 235, Greenbelt, MD 20771 or email at Cassandra.K.Atkinson@nasa.gov and must include, solicitation number, FOB destination to this Center, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.
