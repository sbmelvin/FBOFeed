For Critical Safety Items (CSI), DFARS clause 252.209-7010, Identification of Critical Safety Items, is incorporated by reference. For items for which Government inspection and acceptance will be conducted at the source, DLAD clause 52.246-9004, Product Verification Testing, is incorporated by reference. DLAD clauses can be viewed at http://www.dla.mil/Acquisition/Pages/DLAD.aspx. As applicable, DFARS clause 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, is incorporated by reference. All potential offers shall provide newly manufactured spares only. Refurbished, remanufactured, or repaired material will not be acceptable; Offers for such are ineligible for award. GOVERNMENT PCO POC IS JOHN FINLEY; CORRECT EMAIL IS JOHN.FINLEY@DLA.MIL (PLEASE NOTE THAT "JOHN.P.FINLEY@DLA.MIL" IS INCORRECT.) The Navy has mandated that near-term procurement of parts, consumable and repairable, for the P-8A Aircraft Program must be from either the Prime Contractor or from the OEM, or from an "Authorized Distributor" of either. An "Authorized Distributor" shall provide an official letter from either the Prime Contractor/OEM indicating that they are indeed an "Authorized Distributor" for the specific part number being procured. Without this letter, they shall not be considered eligible for this contract award. "Traceability" alone, of the part being proposed, to the Prime Contractor/OEM will be considered insufficient. This contract will only be awarded to the Prime Contractor, OEM, or to "Authorized Distributors" thereof. The Government physically does not have in its possession sufficient, accurate, or legible data to purchase this part from other than the current source(s). The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx". Interested parties may obtain copies of Military and Federal Specifications and Standards, Qualified Products Lists (QPLs), Qualified Product Databases(QPDs), Military Handbooks, and other standardized documents from the DoDSingle Stock Point (DODSSP) at Document Automation and Production Service(DAPS) in Philadelphia, PA.
