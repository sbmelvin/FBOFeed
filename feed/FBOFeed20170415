<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> In formulating the Qualifications submission, potential respondents should consider that FAR 52.219-14, which will be incorporated into any resultant contract, requires the Prime Contractor to perform services under the contract equivalent to 50% or more of the contract value in personnel costs throughout the life of the contract. This is a positive requirement rather than one where an indication of capacity, capability or willingness to meet these requirements would be acceptable. Respondent(s) should demonstrate in their Qualifications submission how they will meet this requirement. Although the specific project effort awarded under any resultant contract is not known at this time, it is believed to be unlikely a Respondent could reasonably expect to meet this FAR requirement where they propose a Prime Contractor role limited to a single discipline, or possibly even multiple disciplines, where the discipline mix proposed leans towards disciplines typically not heavily utilized in A-E Services for Health Facilities Engineering projects.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer and Important Notes All respondents must register on the SAM located At http://www.sam.gov/.</strong></p>

<p>The work will be performed on behalf of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA), and includes full design by highly qualified Washington State registered architects, engineers, and other appropriately credentialed professionals for disciplines including architecture, structural, electrical, mechanical, fire/life/safety, security, acoustics, audio/visual, and interior design.

For security portions of the work (FIPS 201, FICAM, HSPD12, Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) and Intrusion Detection Systems), specialized subcontractors that are on listed of qualified vendors at www.idmanagement.gov will be required to be utilized.</p>
<p>The work will be required to be phased as spaces become available at different dates and times. As such, close coordination will be required with building tenants. Also, there is high probability that there will be no onsite laydown areas other than in the spaces that the work is being performed. The same applies for onsite<br />waste/debris containers as the containers will not be allowed in or around the building due to security reasons.&nbsp;Disposal will need to occur on an as needed basis.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations:</strong> All on site contractor team working onsite will need to be cleared through GSA and OPM. As such, it is requested that you carefully consider the security processing capabilities of your firm and associated subcontractors. The current process is taking approximately 30 to 45 days or more after a fully completed and accurate package is received. Contractor personnel must be prepared to complete online security questionnaires and obtain fingerprinting at one of the local facilities within the greater Seattle region,&nbsp;The Contractor will need to closely plan and coordinate with the Government to meet GSA, HHS OMHA, requirements for design reviews, material deliveries, and access to high security areas (U.S Marshall's Service).</p>
<p><strong>A Project Development Study (PDS)</strong> was produced for this procurement by the consulting firm of ECH Architecture PS, in conjunction with sub-consultants including Notkin Mechanical Engineers, Veltre Engineering, Inc., Reid Middleton, Inc., Stantec, and HMS Inc. A copy of that PDS will be provided as part of the Design-Build Construction Solicitation, minus any information that is considered procurement sensitive. An organizational conflict of interest may exist for these firms which may prevent their involvement with potential Offerors for the design-build construction procurement for which this pre-solicitation notice is being provided (specific details will be provided regarding whether said firms may be utilized during the competitive procurement).</p>
<p>It is noted that the project will include requirements for brand-name equipment, systems, and services for which an approved Justification will be provided. Brand-name products and services to be included in the approved justification will include PACs as well as existing systems installed within the building (building automation system, HVAC, Fire/Life/Safety, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>MAGNITUDE:</strong> The anticipated magnitude of the project is $5,000,000 and $10,000,000, including all design and construction and related work.</p>
<p><strong>COMPETITION:</strong> Full and Open. This procurement&nbsp;is open to all qualified business firms. Any&nbsp;qualified responsible firm, including large businesses, small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, economically disadvantaged women-owned small businesses, 8(a) certified small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, Alaska Native Corporations, Native American owned small businesses, and other businesses.

Any firm proposing as a joint venture will be required to provide additional documentation regarding its joint venture agreement during the solicitation phase. Businesses of all sizes and socioeconomic status are recommended to add their contact information in the Interested Vendors list for this pre-solicitation notice.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DURATION:</strong>&nbsp;Anticipated award of June 7&nbsp;through September 30, 2018 for all design, demolition, construction and acceptance testing/commissioning and moves.</p>
<p><strong>WARRANTIES:</strong> Both one year full warranties, as well as standard manufacturer's warranties will be required from project substantial completion and acceptance. Specific details will be provided in the Solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>PROCUREMENT STRATGY:</strong> The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 following issuance of a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) on www.fbo.gov. For this contract award process, GSA will issue one Solicitation. The Government will identify the evaluation factors developed in accordance with FAR 15.304 that will serve as the basis for the determination of the Offer which provides the best value to the Government. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses (including both technical and price proposals) to the RFP by the due date established in the RFP. The Government will evaluate all responses to the RFP in accordance with the criteria in the RFP.
