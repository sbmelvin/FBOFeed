<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) for Fabrication of C/SiC Flaperon Test Component.	NASA, Boeing, and AFRL entered into a cooperative agreement to develop the X-37, an experimental reentry vehicle that can be used as a test bed to validate advanced technologies applicable to reusable launch vehicles.  The X-37 can be carried into orbit in the bay of the Space Shuttle or launched as a final stage from an expendable launch vehicle.  NASA LaRC led an integrated product development team composed of LaRC, Boeing, B.F. Goodrich, Albany International Techniweave (AIT), Materials Research and Design, and the Air Force Research Laboratory to develop ceramic matrix composite (CMC) control surfaces for the X-37.  The team worked closely together to develop C/SiC designs for both the flaperons and ruddervators for the X-37 vehicle.  The designs were optimized to minimize the risk for fabrication of the components based on the capabilities of AIT to fabricate the preforms and B.F. Goodrich to densify the preforms with silicon carbide.  Detail designs and finite element thermal/stress analysis models were developed for each of the components.  However, before full-scale C/SiC test articles could be fabricated, the X-37 program was put on hold for at least one year and work on the C/SiC components terminated.  LaRC is proposing to continue the C/SiC development by fabrication of a full-scale C/SiC flaperon using the team design.  The component will be used as a test article to verify the design, fabrication and analysis procedure used by the team.  Adherence to the team design is necessary so that the large amount of test and analysis work that has been completed can be used in evaluating the structural component.  LaRC is seeking contractors that are interested in and capable of fabricating a full-scale C/SiC flaperon test component using the NASA LaRC supplied design.  The test component has a maximum span of approximately 60 inches, a maximum chord of approximately 18.5 inches and a maximum thickness of approximately 5 inches.  The outer mold lines for the component surfaces have double curvature and will be supplied electronically to the contractor for use in fabricating the component.  Data supplied by LaRC and/or generated by the contractor will be restricted in accordance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) procedures.  To receive the drawings necessary to respond to the RFO, you must provide evidence that you are registered with the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls.  You must provide a copy of your registration letter received from the Department of State or provide your PM/DTC Code.

<DESC>This procurement is for mission operations and data analysis for the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO).  The contract will provide the Chandra X-ray Center (CXC) functions comprised of the CXO Operations Control Center and the Science Center.  The functions include science system engineering, ground system development and maintenance, mission operations, science and operations planning, science research, science dissemination, general observation program and outreach support for the CXO Program.  The contract that will result from this action is a follow-on contract to the existing contract with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) in Cambridge MA.  The period of performance for the proposed contract is from September 1, 2003 through August 31, 2009.  MSFC intends to award the follow-on contract to SAO.  SAO has performed the functions described above since launch of the CXO in July 1999.  With its elite collection of astrophysicists and experience attained on x-ray missions, SAO has a unique and demonstrated capability in x-ray astronomy.  SAO's technical expertise and knowledge has been utilized extensively in developing the Chandra operations concepts, toools, processes, software, and ground systems that have been successfully implemented on the CXO Program.	SAO and its team have demonstrated their capabilities and utilization of their skills in keeping the CXO successful in accomplishing its mission, satisfying the global x-ray astronomy community, and staying in the vanguard of the x-ray science frontier.  As a result of SAO's expertise and capabilities in fulfilling the requirements for the CXC contract, the CXO has achieved unparalleled success in x-ray astronomy since its launch in July 1999.	The government believes that competing this requirement will result in significant added risk, substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. NASA/MSFC intends to execute the resulting contract with SAO under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 16, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this effort on a competitive basis based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.	All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  See note 22.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See note 26.  An Ombudsman has been appointed, see NASA Specific note B.  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:   http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html  .

However, the government shall have no obligation to order services to be performed under this contract within the Secondary Area, and its failure to order any such services shall not breach or otherwise violate this contract. In addition, the Secondary Area of this contract may also be Secondary Contract Areas under other contracts. The contractor shall have no obligation to perform services within the Secondary Area, and its failure to do so shall not breach or otherwise violate the contract.  The A/E firm selected shall primarily provide: Design, construction management and inspection, and estimating services for repair and alteration projects but may also be required to provide scope development, planning, interior design, environmental studies, feasibility studies, problem analysis, design review, consulting/design/construction management for elevator work, geotechnical testing, quality control testing, asbestos sampling/hazard assessment/abatement design/air quality monitoring, boundary and topographical surveying, historic structure reports, building evaluation reports and other architectural, engineering and technical services.

A firm-fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating firm-fixed price delivery orders.  A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing delivery orders for projects with an estimate construction cost of less than $2 million will be included in the contract.  The Government will use the fixed price amount in the lookup table which will be a function of project size, type, and complexity.  The lookup table will be provided to the A/E during initial contract negotiations and shall be a mandatory payment provision.  Firms, when responding to this announcement, should address their capability with regard to each of the evaluation factors listed above, as the top rated firms recommended for interview will be recommended solely on their written response to this announcement.

 Part 1 - Project Overview
1. Overview.
This RFP is issued by the Public Buildings Service of the United States General Services Administration (GSA), Greater Southwest Region, Fort Worth, TX, hereinafter referred to as the "Government", to obtain the services of a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMC) (also referred to as Offeror or Contractor) who shall be singularly responsible to satisfy the terms of the resulting contract. The contract is for CMC services in design and construction of the proposed new U.S. Courthouse in El Paso, TX.
1.1. Stage I Process.
The contract will be a Firm, Fixed-Price contract.  The CMC for this contract will be competitively chosen using  Source Selection where all technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  
In this Stage I, GSA is inviting potential offerors to submit qualification information that will allow GSA to advise each respondent in writing whether they are or are not a viable competitor.  For this stage, GSA will evaluate all responses using the criteria stated herein.  Firms that do not submit written responses to this notice for Stage I will not be eligible to compete in subsequent stages of this procurement.
1.2. Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor.
A Construction Manager as Constructor, or CMC, is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services.  The CMC shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer and GSA's selected A-E firm, BPLW Architects and Engineers, Inc., Albuquerque, NM.
1.3. Services to be Provided.
The CMC will provide professional, technical, administrative and clerical personnel as needed to perform all required services including, but not limited to, those described in this RFP.  The scope of CMC services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and optional Construction Phase Services. The services requested of the CMC shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). The CMC must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly design development and construction of the proposed project.  The CMC shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, fire protection and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines.  

Pre-construction Phase Services shall include, but will not be limited to, review and evaluation of the concept, design development and construction document submissions for constructibility, value engineering suggestions, identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documentation, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, cost estimates, and development of subcontractor and supplier interest.

Optional Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, construction of the building, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, maintaining of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, weekly report for special issues 
(if required) monitoring of construction costs, "commissioning" and turnover to designated facility management 
staff and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. 

The CMC shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMC shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  Most importantly, the CMC shall have complete responsibility for construction of the facility.

The base contract shall consist of the pre-construction phase CM services.  The CMC's price for construction phase CM-type services shall be priced as an option exercisable by the Government when the design is complete and funding is available.  Upon the Government's exercise of the option (for construction and construction phase 
CM-type services), the CMC shall then seek competitive proposals for subcontractor pricing of the construction work.  Thereafter, the CMC shall guarantee a maximum project price (GMP) based on the facility described in the Government's construction documents and the RFP package, and the contract will be modified to reflect the agreed upon GMP.  In the alternative, subsequent to the CMC obtaining competitive subcontractor pricing for the construction work, the Government and CMC may agree to a firm fixed-price contract for the construction and construction phase CM-type services. 

The services described or specified shall not be deemed to constitute a comprehensive specification having the effect of excluding services not specifically mentioned.
1.4.  Summary Of Acquisition Strategy.
The contract will be Firm Fixed-Price and Source Selection procedures under FAR 15 will be employed as the method of selection of the successful Offeror.
Proposals will be evaluated using a Two-Stage process.  Under Stage I, offerors must submit information regarding qualifications, past performance, personnel, and resources.  The submittals will be reviewed, evaluated based on the factors stated in this RFP and a determination made of firms that are viable competitors. 
Firms determined to be viable competitors, along with the other non-viable firms submitting Stage I proposals who may request it, will be provided a copy of the Stage II Request for Proposals (RFP) package, including detailed scope of services, the preliminary housing plan, and other information needed to submit an offer. Firms who respond to the RFP will be required in Stage II to submit pricing in accordance with FAR 15.403 and the RFP.  
Firms shall be required to use Oral Presentations to assist the evaluators with their evaluation.  The technical proposals will be reviewed prior to the Contracting Officer's review of price proposals.  The contract may be awarded on the basis of the Stage II submission or the SSEB may request Final Revised Proposal.  If discussions are conducted, offerors will be advised in accordance with FAR 15.306(d)(3) of technical deficiencies and significant weaknesses noted by the technical advisors and the SSEB prior to notification of the standing of the price proposals.
The method for the proposal evaluation will be the "best value" with the technical proposal including all factors being significantly more important than price.
If discussions are necessary, the Government will establish a competitive range.  The Government reserves the right to make an award based on Stage II proposals without holding discussions or conducting negotiations.  
After technical and price evaluations, discussions and/or negotiations, and Final Revised Proposals, if required, 
the SSA will select the Offeror whose offer is most advantageous to the Government. 
1.4.1. Source Selection Evaluation Criteria.
 The following criteria represent the factors that will be used by GSA's Source Selection Evaluation Board 
in evaluating offerors potential as viable competitors. The evaluation factors for Stage I are as follows: 
(1) Past Performance in Providing General Construction Services and Pre-construction Services on Similar Projects; (2) Experience in Providing General Construction Services and Pre-construction Services on Similar Projects; (3) Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel; (4) CMC's Resources, Facilities, and Technology. See Part 3 - Evaluation and Award for information on the relative importance of the factors. 
Additional and/or supplemental information will be required of the offerors in Stage II. Price will also be evaluated in the second stage.
The additional factor to be evaluated only during Stage II is (5) Project Management Plan.  The Project Management Plan will include such information as: project staffing, coordination, communication, quality control plan, safety plan, scheduling, monitoring/controlling costs, problem resolution and utilization of "sustainable" methods and materials in construction, etc.  ***Added on 8/1/02 for testing.***
1.5. Project Scope.
The proposed U.S. Courthouse will be constructed on a government owned site in El Paso, TX.  The Contractor shall provide a new courthouse of approximately 147,859 gross square feet (13,736 square meters) with approximately 93,538 occupiable square feet (8,690 square meters). The U.S. Courts, U.S. District and Bankruptcy Court Clerks, U.S. Probation, U. S. Pretrial Services, Federal Public Defender, U.S. Marshals Service, and the U.S. Attorney will occupy the facility.  The space will include three (3) District Courtrooms and their associated supporting spaces, such as judge's chambers, jury deliberation facilities, jury assembly and grand jury suites, holding cells, etc.  Office space will be provided for the other aforementioned tenants. The project will include approximately 22 interior secure parking spaces and 120 exterior parking spaces.   It is anticipated that multiple bid packages will be developed, ie, base building and tenant improvement work. 
1.6. Price Range.
The estimated range of construction cost is $40,000,000 to $50,000,000 which does not include the fees for Pre-construction and Construction Phase Services of construction management services as defined in the Stage II RFP. Congress is expected to furnish construction funds for this project by FY 2005.
1.7. Project Schedule.
1.7.1. Anticipated Award Period.
The Government anticipates award of this contract by November 15, 2002.  Construction is tentatively scheduled to begin within 14 months of award.  The Government does not guarantee award within this period nor shall the Government be liable for any costs should award occur before or after this period.
1.7.2. Completion or Occupancy Date.
The entire facility must be substantially complete within 586 calendar days from the notice to proceed of the Construction Phase Option.  The Contractor shall identify a guaranteed delivery date within this time frame. 
The guaranteed delivery date must include a 30-day period for complete inspection and testing of all systems and improvements which are to be paid for and conducted by the CMC, including the correction of documented punch list items, and schedule contingencies.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate a sole source delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-02-G-3041 with McDonnell Douglas Corporation, St. Louis, MO for the product improvement of the Advanced Signal Data Computer (ASDC) for the T-45 TS aircraft. McDonnell Douglas Corporation is the sole developer and manufacturer of the T45 TS aircraft. The ASDC effort consists of improvements over the Legacy ADR/SDC. These improvements include the installation of a new processor and memory cards, and incorporation of necessary software changes.  These improvements primarily allow for the collection and retention of a substantially increased amount of flight data.  The modifications also address obsolescence issues with the current ADR and SDC.  The ASDC will have the ability to determine engine life usage via Thermal Transient Algorithms (TTA)?s and to continuously record the associated engine operation and flight data.  Recorded data will be selectively downloadable. The ASDV will be a Form, Fit, and Functional replacement for the existing Airborne Data Recorder (ADR) (vpn 1400000-0010) in the T-45A and the SDC (vpn 1400000-0100) in the T45C. The ASDC will have a single software load capable of determining which model aircraft it is in. No retrofit required. Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

Offerors who do not have same or similar past performance information reasonably available to the Contracting Officer will not be rated either favorable or unfavorable.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, intends to award a sole-source firm fixed price purchase order to Sperry Marine, of Charlottesville, Virginia for the production and delivery of two Bridge Master Radar Kits, each kit includes the following part numbers:  (Antenna 65604/A/X, 65825/LAR/X) (Processor Unit Part Number 65800RARR), (Interface part Number 65847A) and (Operators manual part Number 65800010A). This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: This will replace existing equipment currently in fleet use. This standardization avoids incompatibility issues from vessel to vessel and minimizes maintenance cost. The Bridge Master Radar Kit is the only part that will work with the existing equipment. To change to a new/ different system would be expensive and time consuming  to reconfigure the current vessels and is not advantageous to the government. The existing system configuration hardware and software technology is proprietary to Sperry Marine; NAICS 334511.

Maternal study data will be linked to data on risk factors such as age at menarche and adult height and obesity, which have been collected in the ongoing Nurses' Health Studies.  The results of the analysis will contribute to NCI's understanding of the potential role of birth weight and length and of infant feeding, i.e. early life exposures, on age at menarche and adult height in order to determine whether early life exposures are related to adult risk factors for cancer and potentially link critical periods of exposures for cancer in a woman's life cycle.

<DESC>NASA/Stennis Space Center (SSC) plans to issue a noncompetitive Request for Proposal (RFP) to Lockheed-Martin Space Operations, Stennis Programs, at Stennis Space Center (SSC), MS for a one-year extension of a significant portion of the existing Test and Technical Services Contract (TTSC) NAS13-650 covering the period from September 1, 2003 through August 31, 2004. The existing contract is being descoped by the removal of propulsion test operations support services. These services are being competitively procured under a separate Test Operations Contract (TOC). The descoped TTSC will now be referred to as the Technical Services Contract (TSC). This extension allows for the continuation of the following support services: information technology (IT) management and support services; analytical laboratory services, including environmental services, measurement standards and calibration services, and gas and material analysis; and technical services for research and development, administrative, and institutional program activities in a broad range of science, engineering and technology requirements. These services support the SSC missions and test article contractors in the testing of liquid, hybrid, solid and other propulsion systems, subsystems, and components. Most of the analytical services directly support NASA's rocket propulsion testing programs. The IT services and other technical services support NASA, SSC resident agencies, and commercial customers.The statutory authority for this action is 10 U.S. C. 2304 (d)(1)(B). NASA/SSC intends to acquire these services on a noncompetitive basis from Lockheed-Martin Space Operations, Stennis Programs, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii). Award to any other prime contractor would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling NASA requirements. The one-year extension to the existing TTSC is justified because: (1) a new contract structured is necessary in order to properly accommodate the changing environment at SSC; however, SSC needs another year to let the requirements resulting from the rapidly evolving environment emerge, mature, and be assessed; (2) a simultaneous change to two separate contracts will be disruptive to the SSC at critical stages of several ongoing propulsion programs and the on-going Earth Science Applications (ESA) redirection; and (3) a change to two contracts would be disruptive to customer services at this critical time of solidifying an expanding resident agency and commercial customer base. The RFP will be released during the first quarter of calendar year 2003. The Government does not intend to acquire commercial items using FAR Part 12. See Note 26. See Note 22. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". All responsible sources may identify their interest or capability or submit a proposal; however, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   TITLE: Policy Research for Measuring Success for Superfund NOTIFICATION: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under FAR Part 13, intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to "RESOURCES FOR THE FUTURE" for the services and deliverables stated in this  synopsis:  The Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) is seeking contract support to conduct an independent study to assess what measures of success would be most meaningful to citizens living near Superfund sites, to representatives of environmental groups, to potentially responsible  parties (PRPs), and to Congress and their staff.  The results of the independent study can be addressed as the agency continues to refine and improve it's internal performance measures in the coming years.   SCOPE OF WORK The contractor shall hold discussions with representatives of the full range  of Superfund stakeholders, including representatives of local citizens' groups, congressional staffs, and representatives of environmental and business organizations, to find out what kind of measures they believe would be useful in measuring the success of the Superfund cleanup program.  The  contractor shall identify the list of individuals to be involved in these discussions for this study in keeping with the independent nature of this project, although they will consult with the EPA project officer and technical experts familiar with citizen's groups at Superfund sites. The  contractor shall develop a draft set of measures of success for Superfund, based not only on the results of the discussions, earch about the Superfund program.  The goal is to develop measures that not only track EPA's progress implementing cleanups, but address concerns of citizens living near  sites about the safety of their own site, as well as congressional and other stakeholders concerns about progress in the Superfund program generally.  The contractor shall produce a draft report summarizing the project and laying out the proposed measures of success that will be distributed to all  participants involved in these discussions, as well as to selected EPA Headquarters and Regional staff, for review and comment.  In addition, the contractor shall brief the National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT), as appropriate, on its draft findings.  The  contractor shall consider these comments and respond to them at their discretion, and shall produce a final report that shall be posted on their web page and distributed to the full range of Superfund stakeholders.  The report will be an independent product and will not necessarily reflect the  views of the EPA.  Key project tasks: Research current measures, key pipeline and five-year review milestones; meet with EPA Headquarters staff; discussions with selected congressional, state and environmental citizens' group, and industry representatives; draft independent report recommending  measures of success that would be meaningful to external (non-EPA) stakeholders; circulate draft independent report for external comment; brief NACEPT on draft findings,  prepare final independent report describing project approach, suggesting proposed measures of success and implementation  challenges; and distribute report to representatives of the full range of stakeholders. Estimated Time line: Task 1 - months 1 and 2 Task 2 - months 2 thru 4 Task 3 - months 5 and 6 Task 4 - month 7 Task 5 - month 8 Task 6 - months 9 thru 11 Task 7 - month 12 Period of Performance: 12 months   Deliverables:   The contractor shall complete an independent report, to be published and distributed by the contractor, that outlines proposed measures of success that would provide meaningful indicators of progress and success for Superfund cleanups to key external stakeholders, especially those  directly affected by Superfund sites. Draft report (estimated completion at end of month 6 of project) Final Report (estimated completion at end of month 11 of project)

Termoelectrica is the largest energy company in Romania and the proposed study and subsequent implementation should provide it with a much needed mechanism for cost control and efficiency improvements.

The major goal of this project is to evaluate the need and requirements for the replacement of obsolete analog control systems at 9 Termoelectrica plants with modern process control and optimization systems. The project would identify Termoelectrica needs and look at the currently available solution packages that are considered acceptable by the industry. The proposed project is aimed at the following general targets: 

?	Monitoring unit efficiency (including fuel consumption, losses, produced energy, use of water and chemicals, planned and forced maintenance, station auxiliary loads, etc.);
?	Evaluating total production costs (real time);
?	Evaluating unit dispatch;
?	Evaluating unit commitment procedures;
?	Optimization of maintenance periods.

The survey would lay the groundwork for upgrading the controls and instrumentation of up to 9 power plants and their control rooms with modern, digital, computerized equipment.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $531,750 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to Raytheon Company for algorithm development and analysis for ballistic missile defense critical functions including tracking, discrimination, kill assessment and sensor fusion in support of the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) System.  The required support consists of providing engineering expertise for algorithm development in the areas of threat discrimination and tracking using surface-based radar; threat discrimination and tracking using space-based IR and missile IR/EO seekers and fusion of IR, radar, and EO sensor data for robust threat discrimination.  Raytheon will develop techniques to improve the capability of using the Block Upgrade structure to perform in real-world scenarios and off-nominal conditions.  This includes the developing of improved algorithms and providing engineering expertise and insight into the radar component of relevant missile defense programs.  As the designer/developer of the radars that are major components of the MDA systems, Raytheon has access to the proprietary data, resident expertise and insight into these systems needed to fulfill this requirement.  No other source has this expertise or can attain this expertise within the three-year period of performance, and the duplication of costs associated with awarding to a new contractor cannot be justified.  The estimated cost of the contract is $8 - $20M during the three-year period.  See Note 22.******Note 22 The proposed contract action is for engineering expertise for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement in writing to the Contracting Officer at the address stated below.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) seeks a contractor to provide job analyses and suggested training courses for Disability Examiners (DEs), Medical Consultants (MCs), and Federal Quality Reviewers using the Developing a Curriculum Method (DACUM).  SSA is revising its training program for DEs, MCs in the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) and Federal Quality Reviewers.  The goal is to promote greater consistency among disability adjudicators and reviewers and increase customer satisfaction through more accurate disability determinations.  As a first step in developing the new training program, SSA needs to identify the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) for each of these positions.  A curriculum with specific training courses to address each of these KSAs can then be developed.  The DACUM is a process used to create descriptions of new and emerging jobs, identify specific relevant tasks necessary for a particular job, assess appropriateness of training, and design training programs.  The DACUM process involves: 1) Holding a 2-day focused discussion with 8 to 10 highly skilled participants, including 1 manager, with a facilitator trained in using DACUM and a recorder; and 2) Obtaining a printed document with the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for a particular job and suggested courses to acquire these KSAs.  Within fifteen (15) days after award of a contract, the contractor shall meet with SSA representatives to receive background material and discuss the project.  After this meeting, the contractor shall perform a DACUM beginning with the Medical Consultant position.  Not later than 120 days after the initial meeting with SSA, the contractor shall complete DACUMs for the MC, DE and Federal Quality Reviewer positions and provide reports for each to the SSA project officer.  SSA will select participants for the DACUMs from across the country and will provide participant names to the contractor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541612.  The size standard for this NAICS code is $6.0 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 regarding the acquisition of commercial items.  Solicitation number SSA-RFQ-02-0201, is scheduled for release on or about May 24, 2002, with quotes due no-later-than 14 calendar days thereafter.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES OF THE RFQ WILL NOT BE MAILED.  Telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders list will be maintained.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the FedBizOpps website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments that may be issued.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  Offers received from other than small business sources will be deemed unacceptable and will not be considered.   All questions must be submitted via email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov.  See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Sherryann Douglas-Ballard, 703 607-1217
<DESC>NA Solicitation DAHA90-02-R-0019 is amended to include questions and answers regarding  the procurement of this requirement. 1)  Question: Are all three CLINs to be shipped, in equal quantities, to all the addresses on the list?  (i.e. 500 here; 200 there, etc.) Answer: Please see the attached zip code list, which includes the required quantities to be shipped to the corresponding zip codes.  2)  Question: We are assuming that each CLIN could be shipped, by itself given the fact that their manufacturers' warehouses are in separate locations and consolidation would add additional costs. Correct? Answer:       Items for each CLIN can be shipped independently from each other as long as it meets the delivery date of 15 October 2002. 3)  Question: It appears as if there isn't a minimum stepping surface dimension? Correct?   Answer:       Minimum requirement of size of step---large enough to allow two feet to be planted on top without safety issues and could hold up to 300 lbs. 4)  Question: It may also appear as if the height of the  Stackable Steps don't matter, so one may offer them in 4 inches, 6 inches, 12 inches, or adjustable. Correct?  They would all add-up to the 12 inches desired height.  Answer:       The Government needs a step that measures a total of 12 inches. 5)  Question: Given the above specs, the stackable step unit may be of any height size, as long as they can stack up to 12 inches. Correct?  We were concerned that the unit height of 12 inches might require, one of the following: 5,124 units of 12 inches, or 10,248 unit s of 6 inches, or 15,372 units of 4 inches? Answer: If you must double or triple the quantity in order to meet the requirement, that is acceptable.  i.e. 5,124 units of 12 inches or 10,248 units of 6 inches, etc.   6)  Question: As far as the yoga mats: You have specified Sticky Mats, which is a style name - used by a particular manufacturer. There are, however, other manufacturers, which market identical yoga mats, using other names. A few also use a newer and better foam density  (with a very slight thickness difference) to provide more comfort to the user. We would assume that these comparable styles and thickness (1/4 inch vs 3/8 inch) would be also acceptable.  Correct? Some of these, by the way, offer a more comparable priced and thus are a better value to the government! Answer:       The yoga mat does not have to be Sticky Mat but a comparable mat that would not slide.  Thickness may vary slightly but not to exceed 1/8 of an inch.  7)  Question: Do you desire any particular color on the mats?  They are available in Teal, purple or green or any color would do?        Answer:        The requirement is for no particular color but all must be the same color.        8)  Question:        Two of the items, the yoga mats and the pulse monitors are made in Taiwan.  I know of no yoga mats or pulse monitors made in the U.S.  Could you please advise me of the implications for these two items and any impact on the all or none basis provisi on of the solicitation?         Answer:         The buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10) provides that the Government give preference to domestic end products.  Domestic end product is defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation as (1) an unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United S tates, or (2) an end product manufactured in the United States, if the cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components.  Components of foreign origin of the same class or kin d as the products referred to in subparagraphs (b)(2) or (3) of this clause shall be treated as domestic.  Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is consider domestic.        Components, as used in this clause, means those articles, materials, and supplies incorpo rated directly into the end products.          End products, as used in this clause, means those articles, materials, and supplies to be acquired for public use under this contract.   	         9)  Question:         Are there any particular brands you want to receive your quotes on?         Answer:          No.  As long as the product meets the requirement of the dimensions being requested, there is no brand preference.  	 	 **All or none refers to proposing an offer for all the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) being procured or none at all.  If you are unable to submit an offer for all CLINs, do not submit a proposal because it will be considered nonresponsive.

<DESC>NPS Traffic Monitoring Program, Coverage Count and Data Reporting Project   -   This will be a professional services contract to conduct extensive traffic data coverage counting, and traffic data processing along with traffic data generated from a system of continuous traffic counters, for the production of a system-wide Traffic Data Report for the National Park Service (NPS). The current program entails 33 park units across the country.  Latest coverage counts were produced for the NPS 1994 Traffic Data Report.  In total, the coverage counts will consist of approximately 400 48-hour volume count locations, and approximately 60 vehicle classification locations and 50 vehicle occupancy counts locations.  The collected data will be processed and adjusted by approximately 100 continuous traffic counters that are currently in place for the Traffic Monitoring Program, operated and maintained by the Field Operations Technical Support Center of the NPS in Denver, Colorado.  The traffic data is to be presented graphically in the form of maps, charts and tables and be packaged as the updated (2003) Traffic Data Report. The processed traffic data and characteristics captured by this survey will be electronically implemented into a Geographical Information System/Database (GIS) intended to link and be compatible with the NPS' existing Road Inventory Program and Bridge Inventory Program, and with the various (Safety, Pavement, Congestion) Management Systems currently being developed by the NPS in partnership with the FHWA.  The needs and priorities for this Traffic Monitoring Program are specific to NPS' planning and programming activities, and are not necessarily for the national Highway Performance Monitoring System.  Nonetheless the NPS Program could supplement the special needs of State agencies.  In this regard, the FHWA Traffic Monitoring Guide shall be invoked where applicable for guidelines in performing this work, where such work would not explicitly be described in the Scope of Work.  The work is intended to commence in Fall 2002, with a target completion of the coverage counts in Summer 2003.  The subsequent Report and GIS implementation is to be completed and ready for use and distribution by January 2004.  The value of this contract is estimated at $540,000.  Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer. Technical evaluatons factors will include, at a minimum (1) Recent experience of the firm in providing expansive traffic data collection and processing services, including the firm's capability to effectively mobilize and control a data collection team; (2) Professional qualifications of key individuals to be assigned; (3) Formal quality control/quality assurance procedures of the firm in effect and related to the nature of work; (4) Past performance on other contracts, including any awards received or references that may be contacted; (5) Percentage of minorities and women, by general work classification.  Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to prime conractors responding to this notice.  Tentative date for issuance of RFP is August 19, 2002.  Tentative award is September 30, 2002.  Anticipated contract duration is from date of award until January 31, 2004.  The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), has a program to assist minority, women-owned, and disadvantaged business enterprises to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.  Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $500,000.  For further information and applicable forms concerning the STLP, please call the OSDBU at (800) 532-1169.

<DESC>Ques:  What is the color of the chassis? Black vs. Gray
Ans:  No color preference

Ques:   Will you accept the 45U cabinet from Tripp Lite?
Ans:  If it holds everything in a single rack, yes. 

Ques:  Do you need the first cooling fan and tray to be installed with the cabinet and the other two as spare parts? 
Ans:  We only need enough fans to fill the rack in whatever configuration it comes in.  Our requirement, however, is that whatever rack is chosen, it has the ability for highly efficient cooling. 
Ques:  Will you accept Samsung 753DF because we cannot locate any 753DP?
Ans:  As long as it is a 17" (or larger) monitor with similar specifications, it should suffice. 
 Ques:   Do you need keyboard and mouse for each of the 16 slave computer?

Ans:  No.  A keyboard and mouse is only required for the master node and for the separate terminal system. 
 
Ques:  Do you have a preference for how many pieces of memory to be installed into Master and Slave Nodes? 
Ans:  4 by 512
Ques:  Do you have a requirement for a specific Hard Drive manufacturer (2-80 GB, 7200 RPM IDE Hard Drive IDE)?  
Ans:  no preference

Ques:  CD Read/Write compact disk drive on Master Node, do you have a requirement for a specific speed?  
Ans:  24X
Ques:   Do you have a requirement for a specific manufacturer?  
Ans:  No preference.
Ques:  For the Workstation, FSB for Intel Pentium 4 2.0 GHz CPU is 400MHz, the next step up is 533MHz.  Is your requirement 400MHz or 533MHz FSB.
Ans:  400MHz is minimum requirement, if cost difference isn?t significant, will consider 533MHz FSB.
Ques:  Which version of Linux do you require on the workstation?  
Ans:  Professional 
Ques:  Tape Drive, which OverLand DLT 8000 Drive do you require? 
Ans:  The requirement is that we have a tape backup system that can store approximately 800GB of (compressed) data and can be set up to be automated.  Ideally, it would be nice to rackmount the drive, but only if the entire system can stay within a single rack.  Otherwise, a table-top model is fine.  There is no particular preference on tape-drive manufacturer.

<CONTACT>Michele Cameron, Contracting Officer, Phone 661-277-9566, Fax 661-275-7808, Email michele.cameron@edwards.af.mil
<DESC>The following questions were submitted and responses are as follows:

1.  What is the quantity of master and slave nodes in the cluster? I see that they are looking for cables for 18 systems but there is no mention of how many nodes of each type. I would expect it is 1 master, 16 slaves and 1 management terminal but wanted to be sure.   

Ans:  We require that the system have 1 master and 16 slave dual processor nodes.  As for the management terminal, the 17? monitor, a keyboard, and mouse will be connected directly to the cluster and reside next to it.  A second terminal system is required and will not be configured as part of the cluster system.  This second terminal will be used as a workstation and will access the cluster via the lab network.


2.  The memory module specified in the description is PC800 and that is RAMBUS, however the Tyan S2720GN uses DDR memory instead. 

Ans:  That was a typo.  PC800 ECC DDR should be replaced with PC2100 ECC DDR.


3.  1) How many slave nodes are required?  2) Is the equipment to reside in 1 Rack?  

Ans:  The cluster will have 1 master node and 16 slave dual processor nodes.  Yes, the cluster should reside on a single rack.

<DESC>THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO THIS SOLICITATION.  THIS MODIFICATION IS BEING RE-SUBMITTED FOR OBTAINING ADDITIONAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

This notice announces the General Services Administration?s; Federal Supply Service intent to solicit offers under the Standing Solicitation Number FCGS-W8-98-0316-N, covering Worldwide Multiple Award Federal Supply Schedule 66, Part II, Section J for Test and Measurement Equipment, Avionics Equipment, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Related Services.  This solicitation covers a wide range of products and services, as they relate to Test and Measurement Equipment and Services, Avionics Equipment and Services, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.   Product Support Options (PSOs) are services that relate to the Test and Measurement product lines and support the individual products themselves.  These services are in addition to the standard commercial offered options.  PSOs are covered by the following SINs: 627-2000 ? Equipment Maintenance and Repair; 627-2001 ? Pre-Purchase Calibration or Calibration Traceability Certificate; 627-2002 ? Post-Purchase Calibration or Calibration Certificate; 627-2003 ? Extended Warranty; 627-2004 ? Service Agreement; 627-2005 ? Technical Training and Support (TTS); 627-2006 ? Technical/Application Development Support (TADS).  In order to provide product support options under these SINs, the offeror must be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or OEM certified and approved.  For all product support options, the offeror shall comply with regulatory requirements, guidelines, and/or standards, which govern the particular equipment and are of commercial practice.    Offers for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Services are hereby solicited.  The applicable SINs are as follows:  627-4000 ? UAV Operations Support (Government Owned/Leased Equipment); and 627-4001 ? UAV Operations Support (Contractor Furnished Equipment).  These solicitation allows for offers for new services and/or products under the Introduction to New Services/Products (INSP) SIN 627-1007; see Clause L-FSS-400.  This SIN is intended for the temporary placement of new services and products until the service/item can be formally placed on an existing or newly created SIN on this schedule.  This solicitation has been prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, which implements Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 (Public Law 103-355), the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106), and the final rule, published as General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAM) Change 76, regarding commercial item acquisitions under the Multiple Award Schedule Program.  The contract format and data requirements in this solicitation differ from previous solicitations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to carefully review the entire solicitation package before submission to ensure compliance with commercial item provisions.  This solicitation is a ?standing? solicitation, which allows vendors to submit offers at anytime; therefore, there is no closing date for the receipt of offers under this solicitation.  This solicitation will be periodically refreshed to include new and updated provisions and instructions as they relate to the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) Program.  The solicitation can be downloaded from the Internet at http://www.eps.gov.   Resultant contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), Firm-Fixed priced, with an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA).   The new provision entitled, ?GSA Advantage!?, has now been incorporated into this solicitation.  This new provision requires all schedule contractors to submit their electronic files to GSA Advantage! by July 1, 2001, or 6 months after contract award, whichever is later.   A new term called ?Evergreen Contracting? option periods has been added to this Solicitation.  The Evergreen clause provides new policies and procedures to expand the multiyear contracts for all MAS Federal Supply Schedules to a one 5-year basic contract period, with three separate 5-year option periods.  The Government Contracting Officer may exercise the option to extend the contract for an additional five (5) year period, by providing a written notice to the contractor at least 150 days prior to the expiration date of the contract period.  When the Government exercises its option to extend the term of this contract, option prices must be determined fair and reasonable at the time the option is exercised.  The Contracting Officer will obtain a contractor statement that the basis of award customer/Most Favorite Customer (MFC) has remained the same and that pricing information provided to negotiate the contract, as well as any other pertinent information in order for the Government to determine that at the current prices are fair and reasonable.  All vendors and current contractors should be aware that the Evergreen Contracting option period extension can not be exercised if your electronic catalog has not been approved and posted on GSA Advantage!.  Contractors are now required to accept the Government purchase card for payments equal to or less than the micro-purchase threshold for oral and written delivery orders and you are encouraged to accept the Government purchase card for payment for orders above the threshold.  See GSAM Clause 552.232-77 entitled, ?Payment By Government Commercial Purchase Card?.  This solicitation contains the clause ?Contractor?s Report of Sales? (552.238-74), which requires the submission of sales on electronic GSA Form 72A via the Internet and the ?Industrial Funding Fee (IFF)? (552.238-76), which requires a 1% fee due every quarter, for sales under any resultant contract.  The IFF must be included in the offered prices to GSA under this solicitation.  There is a contract sales criterion for all MAS contracts.  Clause I-FSS-639 entitled, ?Contract Sales Criteria?, states that a contract will not be awarded if the anticipated sales are not expected to exceed $25,000.  Resultant contracts will be canceled unless reported sales for each 12-month period from the date of award are not $25,000 or above.  This schedule period will be continuance, and will contain contracts with contract periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five (5) years (exclusion of any options) from the DOA.

Sources researching and developing NBC detectors with the following characteristic s are sought:  Solid state nuclear detectors optimized for gamma ray detection up to at least the 600 kev range; Solid state materials used in detection with large active volume to increase detector geometric efficiency and reduce sampling time; High charg e carrier mobilities and long charge carrier lifetimes to promote efficient charge collection; High atomic weight  to promote photoelectric absorption during gamma-ray interactions; Relatively small band gap to reduce the average ionization energy required  to produce an electron-hole pair, to increase the number of charge carriers excited per unit of deposited energy, and to decrease statistical fluctuations; Room temperature operation without cooling apparatus to reduce logistical requirements for operatio nal suitability reasons; Advanced design of portable, ruggidized, self-contained instrumentation used to screen aqueous samples for the presence of chemical & biological warfare agents and associated precursor/degradation compounds. The goal of this effort  is to combine multiple technologies into a single comprehensive nuclear, biological and chemical detector.  The ultimate goal of the DTRA/Technology Development R & D activities is to improve detection and characterization of nuclear biological and chemic al threats; Improve sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity of NBC measurements conducted in a field environment; Develop innovative means to identify WMD agents; Advance technologies for verification and compliance monitoring; Develop portable hand held  instruments with minimal battery power needs for use by non-technical personnel to support arms control inspections in the nuclear/chemical/biological arena.  Respondents should submit the following information regarding their capabilities:  1)  Resumes o f key personnel.  2)  Description of laboratory complexes - to include analytical chemistry laboratories, radiological laboratories, materials and processes laboratories, metallurgical laboratories, metrological laboratories, and biological laboratories. 3)  Description of fabrication/production capability to build prototypes and limited instrumentation production.  4)  Description of on-going work in NBC arena described above.  5)  Description of Security Clearances - personnel and facilities.  6)  Descri ption of all research facilities available for use.  7)  Description of any relationship(s) with academic research institutions.  8)  Hazardous material acceptance, storage and handling capability.

<DESC>This posting is for informational purposes only.  The government currently does not have a requirement for Air Traffic Control Services at Soto Cano Air Base.  The government is seeking potential interested sources to submit information on their company, GSA schedule information, if applicable, NAICS code, and business size standard.  The following paragraphs details specific tasks and qualifications needed:  

Air Traffic Control (ATC) Services.  Perform ATC Tower services during US and Honduran flight operations.  Personnel shall be capable of performing tower operations 7-days a week, 24-hours a day.  

Specific Tasks.  Provide air traffic control tower services for U.S. aircraft utilizing Soto Cano Air Base.  This includes local and ground control, flight data, and clearance delivery positions.  Sequence and separate air traffic through the application of U.S. Air Force, U.S Army, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization, host nation, and local rules and directives.  Coordinate air traffic and airport movement area activity with appropriate agencies.  Ensure the safe and efficient flow of U.S air traffic while concurrently coordinating efforts with Honduran controllers utilizing the same airspace and runway.  Initiate, when directed or situations dictate, crash-rescue response during aircraft in-flight/ground emergencies.  Conduct and document initial, qualification, and annual training/position certification IAW U.S. Air Force and FAA requirements.  Provide operational checks on all ATC equipment required for U.S. operations at the beginning of each shift.  Maintain administrative logs and records as required by U.S. Air Force instructions.  Advise the Chief Controller or Quality Assurance Evaluator immediately of any operational, administrative, or equipment deficiencies.  While on duty during non-peak hours assist educating Honduran Air Force (HAF) controllers in US ATC terminology.  

Note:  The on-duty contractor controller shall strive to improve the on-duty HAF?s controller?s grasp of technical language skills while in the tower.  Historically, host-nation controllers have limited English reading, writing, and speaking skills.  Their increased knowledge in technical language skills will help improve critical tower management capabilities during air/ground emergencies.

Qualifications.  Read, write, and speak fluently in both English and Spanish.  ATC personnel shall have a current FAA Air Traffic Control Medical Certification and shall possess a FAA Air Control Tower Operator Certificate from an ATC facility where a previous rating was held.  Prospective ATC personnel shall have performed ATC duties within the last 2 years and must have 4 years experience as a Tower Watch Supervisor or equivalent.  The FAA certificate shall be current and IAW FAA Order (FAAO) 7220.1.

Again, this posting is for informational purposes only and the government does not currently have a requirement for this service.  All information submitted will become property of the U.S. government and will not be returned.  All interested sources are to submit pertinent information to 355th Contracting Squadron, 3180 S. Craycroft Rd., Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ  85707 no later than 30 August 2002.  Point of contact is SSgt Cesar Suarez, (520)228-3873 or alternate SSgt Steven Barry, (520)228-2114.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to allow the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Central Administrative Support Center to determine the availability of commercial sources to fill three positions at the Commerce BankCard Center (CBC).  This is not a request for proposal, but a market survey/analysis.
Contactors capable of providing the services below should respond in writing to the address above with a notice of capability and estimated pricing for these positions.  The agency will use this information to determine whether it is in the best interest of the Government to use commercial sources or existing Federal resources to fill these positions.
These positions are assigned to the Central Administrative Support Center (CASC), BankCard Center, at 1500 East Bannister Rd in Kansas City, Missouri, under the direction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC).  Under the present plan, it would be the Government's intent to select one firm to fill all of the positions. There are three positions: one management analyst, one computer specialist and one bankcard assistant.
Work is to be performed in a typical office setting within the Bannister facility. The contractor staff selected for these positions will be required to undergo a security investigation at the contractor's expense.  Normal operating hours are from Monday through Friday, except for official U.S. Government holidays. Employees shall work a complete shift between the hours of 7:30 am and 4:30 pm. 
The management analyst and bankcard assistant are equivalent to full-time positions.  The computer specialist hours may fluctuate between 20 to 40 hours of work per week depending on the demand of specialized reporting.  This work may diminish to 15-hours- a-week as systems become more automated.
The Government will provide forty hours of initial training to each contractor employee.  The Contractor will be responsible for reimbursing the Government for the training of replacement employees should the employee leave the position within one year.  Training costs will vary depending on the position.  The management analyst and computer specialist positions are highly technical and require higher-level training; therefore, retraining costs for these positions will be significantly higher than that of the bankcard assistant.  The contractor is responsible for all costs to keep their employees trained at the level necessary to perform the work, particularly in the area of IT systems.
The positions serve as assistants to the BankCard Liaison Officer for the DOC Purchase Card Program and directly assist with the coordination and oversight of approximately 7,000 purchase cards issued to DOC and non-DOC employees.  These position are responsible for providing assistance to client agencies, in such areas as the establishment of purchase card and check accounts and the maintenance of those accounts, and with private sector vendors in such areas as resolving problems with purchase card purchases.
The work performed has a direct impact on the agencies participating in the Purchase Card Program.  The nature of the advice and training provided through these positions influences the agency's effectiveness in doing business.
Immediate and accurate information must be provided to cardholders, merchants, and agency representatives in order to prevent delays and interruptions in accomplishment of missions worldwide and, in some cases, a complete shutdown of agency operations. Incorrect advice provided to a cardholder could jeopardize the effectiveness of the program and the cardholder's ability to remain compliant and hinder future program expansion.  Incorrect answers could cause cardholders to act inappropriately, bringing reprimand upon them and, in severe cases, ultimately cause cancellation of purchase cards.
These positions require contact with the general public, merchants, merchant banks, other
Government Agencies, client agency personnel in finance and procurement, purchase cardholders, approving officials and Office of the Inspector General investigators throughout the DOC and non-DOC agencies serviced by the CBC.
These positions require the use of discretion with release of confidential and secured information and training in customer service techniques. They require a general knowledge of the credit card industry practices, Visa-International/MasterCard regulations and the ability to make judgments in developing work procedures, resolving problems and making open-handed, independent decisions.
Management Analyst-Management and Program Analysts serve as analysts and advisors to management on the evaluation of the effectiveness of government programs and operations or the productivity and efficiency of the management of Federal agencies or both.  This position requires knowledge of the substantive nature of the agency bankcard programs and activities, agency missions, policies, and objectives.  The analyst must apply management principles and processes along with analytical and evaluative methods and techniques for assessing program development, expansion or execution and improving organization effectiveness and efficiency.  This position requires an understanding of basic budgetary and financial management principles and techniques as they relate to long range planning of programs and objectives.  The work requires skills in application of fact-finding and investigative techniques, oral and written communications, and development of presentations and reports.                 
The incumbent of this position is responsible for the review and analysis of policy and procedural issues, funding, and work management processes and provides related program support and assistance on management initiatives, information collection, printing and publications of documents and workforce analysis. The analyst may work on internal control management and coordination or research and investigate new or improved business and management practices for application to the BankCard Center.  The analyst may serve as a project leader or as a team leader within the organization.
The analyst also serves as coordinator for the Director of the BankCard Center in matters of competitive sourcing.  In the areas of competitive sourcing, process re-engineering, and shifting to commercial practices, the analyst coordinates the development and implementation of necessary policies and procedures with the Director and contractors.    
The position requires the ability to identify commercial practices that support re-engineering of products and services including the area of information management and identifies techniques for successfully anticipating changes in the customer base to improve support and reduce cost. The analyst also performs business case analyses to identify likely candidates for re-engineering or outsourcing and attends conferences or facilitates studies to gather information from government and commercial sources.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis in support of the FISC Puget Sound, A-76 Commercial Activities Study, involving Physical Distribution Support. The effort involves the performance of physical warehouse work, such as receiving, inspecting, stocking, conducting physical inventories, issuing materials, accepting material returns, kitting, traffic management, and special events support. The work generally does not include related work of managing files, processing requisitions, and providing inventory management. Also it generally does not include heavy packing, shipping, and transporting materials. Commodities handled can vary widely. Commodities can range in size and weight to include extremely large, heavy, or bulky items. Examples include plates and shapes (I-beams, angles), barstock, electrical cable, lumber, timbers, pipes, and tubing. Some commodities, such as electrical cable, barstock, pipe and tubing, must be cut by the service provider to lengths specified by the customer's issue request. Commodities include specialized material, such as explosive, hazardous material, level 1, small arms, ammunition, and classified. The work will require the use of multiple Government databases and software programs to provide logistical and financial controls for each record established in the databases and software programs. The list of databases and software programs are as follows: Logistics Data System (LDS); Uniform Automated Data Processing System-Stock Points (UADPS-SP); Material Access Technology (MAT); Distribution Standard System (DSS); Classified Arms, Ammunition and Explosives Tracking (CAT) Database; Navy Supply Discrepancy Reporting System; MAXIMO; Electronic Quality Deficiency Report System; Shelf-Life Item Management System (SLIM); Trident Resource Management System (TRMS), Credit Card Receive Module; Federal Logistic Data on Compact Disk (FED LOG); Haystack; Receipt Problem Database (RPD); Product Data Reporting and Evaluation Program (PDREP); and Product Quality Deficiency Report/Supply Discrepancy Report (PQDR/SDR) Program. The primary work locations will be at the Bangor and Bremerton, WA sites. Service will be required at multiple areas within each site. Limited off-site physical distribution support may be necessary at the San Diego, CA sites in North Island and Pt. Loma; Kings Bay, GA; Pearl Harbor, HI; and Mayport, FL. The acquisition will be solicited on a Firm Fixed Price basis, for a base year and 4 option years. FISC Puget Sound intends to issue the acquisition as a 100% small business set-aside, under the NAICS code of 493110, General Warehousing and Storage, size standard $21.5M.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard intends to award a follow on small purchase contract to Geo-Engineers Inc. for updates to PSSDA characterization services for Pier 36, Berth Alpha located at Integrated Support Command, Seattle, WA.  Geo-Engineers Inc. has previously completed these characterization services for Pier 36 Berth Alpha through the 35 percent design phase. The results of this characterization updates previous work performed on Pier 36 which would result in duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through soliciting competitive proposals again.  Estimated contract amount is not expected to exceed $60,000 for these services.

<SUBJECT>A -- Multi-User Laser Communication Concepts and Technology
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Sensors Directorate and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Advanced Technology Office are seeking information about technology and work that supports the development of Multi-User Laser Communication capability. Information about ideas, concepts and technology programs that support the development of an optical system capable of simultaneous multiple access/multi-user free space laser communication is being solicited.  To date, the development of free space laser communication hardware has concentrated on single user point-to-point systems that do not accommodate multiple users. A multi-user capability will greatly enhance the utility of laser communications in both the airborne and space environments.  Concepts for multi-user access to a laser communication network should have a sufficiently large field of regard in order to receive signals from multiple disperse users at the same time.  In addition, the optical system must be able to determine the location of the user, such as from the angle of arrival of the signal, and then allow for the beam steering necessary to establish the communication link.  Multiplexing technologies that support the use of ?channels? to establish network identity and connectivity among the diverse users is one area of interest.  Ideally the system will be able to transmit and receive simultaneously, to different users within the field of regard of a given network architecture. There are two areas of interest were multi-user access will be required in the future, air-to-satellite and air-to-air networks. Information about concepts and technologies that support either or both of these areas are being solicited. Ideas and technologies for a space based terminal should address the current and projected state of space qualification, lifetime and environmental support for those concepts.  Ideas and technologies for airborne terminals should address the larger fields of regard (essentially 4 Pi steradian) that a multi-access system must contend with to successfully implement an air-to-air network.  In all cases the intent of this RFI is to identify concepts and technologies that will lead to the development of multi-access terminals with a small form factor that will lend itself to tactical usefulness. This announcement is a request for information, and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued. However, DARPA, AFRL and the Air Force will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning, especially near-to-mid term investment planning. It is recognized that any cost information provided by the contractor is a preliminary estimate for planning purposes; the contractor will not be bound to these estimates. Subsequent acquisitions may follow in the ways that best meet technology needs. The government invites comments related to possible purchase or acquisition strategies. SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: This announcement is UNCLASSIFIED. AFRL anticipates that information received in response to this RFI will be UNCLASSIFIED. The Air Force will not reimburse providers for the cost of submitting information in response to this RFI.

The following 1052.204-72 (Treasury Dept.) clause applies to this solicitation:  REQUIRED CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (JAN 2002) The United States Department of the Treasury has adopted the Department of Defense?s Central Contractor Registration database as its database for contractor information.  (This clause does not apply to the Treasury Bureau known as the Comptroller of the Currency.)  Accordingly, the following requirements apply to this contract. (a) Definitions.  As used in this clause -- (1) ?Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database? means the primary Department of Defense (DoD) repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DoD. (2) ?Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number? means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) ?Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number? means the DUNS number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern.  This 4-digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying sub-units or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) ?Registered in the CCR database? means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4, if applicable, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number has been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that it must be registered in the CCR database prior to contract award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. (2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS+4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (3) Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award of a Treasury contract. (4) DoD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet.  However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days.  Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c)The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data.  To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete. (d) Following the Contractor?s initial registration in CCR and receipt of any Treasury Department (excluding the Comptroller of the Currency) award of a contract, purchase order, delivery order, task order, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement, the Contractor must directly notify the Contracting Officer of any of its changed mandatory business data in CCR within three business days of the change.  (See the CCR Handbook at www.ccr.gov for the current mandatory registration data fields, or contact the CCR Assistance Center at 888-227-2423 or 616-961-4725.)Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov, from the Defense Electronic Business Program Office (Defense e-Business) at contact.ccr@us.pwcglobal.com, from the CCR Assistance Center at 888-227-2423 or 616-961-4725, from the Defense Logistic Information Service at dlis_support@dlis.dla.mil. Contractors such as some consultants and sole proprietorships that are small firms that would otherwise have no use for a Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) number, may use an alternative D&B registration method.  If needing a D&B number principally for CCR registration, such a Contractor should call D&B toll-free at 800-333-0505, and clearly state that it is a very small business and simply needs a DUNS number for the purpose of CCR registration.  At a minimum, responsible sources should provide this office: a price proposal on letterhead that should show the requested items; with their unit prices, extended prices, total price, prompt payment terms, warranty, shipping prices, remittance address, Tax I.D. #, Duns #, and Cage Code.  Responses to this solicitation are due by AUGUST 30, 2002 at 1600 (4:00 p.m.).  Quotes can be faxed to (415) 848-4711 Attn: Christine Matschkowsky, e-mailed to Christine.Matschkowsky@irs.gov, or mailed to: Internal Revenue Service, Procurement Operations Branch, Western Area, 333 Market Street, Suite 1400, Attn: Christine Matschkowsky, San Francisco, CA 94105.
