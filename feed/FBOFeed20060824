<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for 2 each, Delta/GDP Space Systems model MD266-8, 8 Channel Bit Synchronizers.  The PCM Bit Synchronizer (bitsync) must be able to process at least 8 PCM streams. Each bitsync input channel must be individually programmable with the follow specifications:  • Channel Bit Rates: 40bps to 10 Mbps  • PCM Codes: NRZ-L/M/S, RNRZ, BiØ-L/M/S, DM-M/S  • Viterbi Decoding  • Each channel card must be individually swappable without interupting any other channel. Redundant Power Supply:  • The bitsync unit must have a redundant power supply.  • The bitsync redundant power supply must be swappable without disabling the operation of the unit.  Remote Control:  • Unit operation must be remotely controlled using a RS-232 port.  The GDP Space Systems Model MD266-08 8 Channel Bit Synchronizer is the only known product that meets this government requirement.  This unit allows for hot swapping of the individual Bit Synchronizer channels.  In addition it allows for hot swapping of the redundant power supply.  If a failure on a Bit Synchronizer channel occurs during an operation a new channel card can be installed without interrupting the operation of the other channels.  Also the how swappable redundant power supply can be replaced without interfering with the operation of the unit as a whole.	This hot swappable feature improves the operational reliability of our telemetry system. NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from GDP Space Systems of Horsham PA. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 28, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

DESCRIPTION:

The Development Outreach Communications Specialist (DOCS) supports USAID Regional Development Mission/Asia (RDMA), Bangkok, Thailand, in the achievement of its objectives by producing and disseminating public information about the Mission’s activities in the region in order to educate and promote better understanding of USAID programs for both regional and American audiences.  The DOCS is responsible for collecting, investigating, managing and distributing information associated with the USAID foreign assistance program in the region.  The DOCS serves as the Mission’s primary point of contact and liaison for information requests. 

The DOCS’ recommendations on development outreach will assist Mission management in making policy decisions.  The DOCS also collaborates closely with the technical offices and implementing partners in developing and implementing the Mission’s overall Communication Strategy.  S/he maintains regular contact with and collaborates with the U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Officer (PAO) to ensure that Embassy personnel are properly apprised of USAID public activities and projects.  S/he also serves as principal liaison with the Agency’s Legislative and Public Affairs Bureau in Washington (USAID/W).  

BACKGROUND:

USAID/RDMA, which opened in Bangkok, Thailand in June 2003, manages regional and country-specific programs in mainland Southeast Asia (Burma, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam) as well as HIV/AIDS and environmental programs that extend east into the Pacific and west into South Asia.  RDM/A also serves as the regional hub for services including contracting, administration and disaster response.  A strategy was approved for RDM/A in FY 2005, which re-focuses the program into four strategic objectives (plus a separate strategic objective for tsunami assistance) in fiscal year 2006.   The Mission portfolio includes a broad range of economic growth, democracy, health and social program activities.  The mission also plays a key role in the USG tsunami response and leads the USG’s participation in development of a tsunami early warning system.

NOTE: The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires that contractors be registered in the Central Contractors Registration Database and the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database, prior to being awarded a contract. The first step to register is to obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, which is a unique nine-character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun and Bradstreet (D&B).   To request a DUNS number call D&B at the toll free number 1-866-705-5711 or register on-line at http://www.dnb.com/ccr/register.html. Obtaining a DUNS number through this process is free of charge.  After obtaining your DUNS number register in CCR and OCRA by visiting the two following websites:  http://www.ccr.gov and http://orca.bpn.gov.  The CCR Customer Assistance Center can be contacted toll free at:  1-888-227-2423. It behooves anyone who is submitting a bid to begin this process as soon as possible since it can take several days to complete.  If the low apparently successful bidder does not become registered in both the CCR and the ORCA database within three business days of being notified of its successful bid, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered bidder. Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering.  Bidders who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.  If you are not interested in submitting a bid, no response is necessary.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration, Central Federal Lands Highway Division is proposing to purchase approximately 2500 units of a work zone intrusion alarm on a sole source basis from Paedia LLC, 327 Lake Street, San Francisco, CA.  The intrusion alarm is the SonoBlaster II Work Zone Intrusion Alarm.  This is a  device designed to alert highway workers and errant motorists when a vehicle has entered a construction workspace.   The devices will be used in demonstration activities by state highway agencies, federal agencies and local agencies with the purpose being to evaluate the safety operational characteristics of the devices and to educate highway workers of potential hazards.  

This device should be simple to use when attached to existing traffic control devices and has a high potential for saving lives of workers and errant motorists.  The alarm device must provide an audible alarm to provide immediate feedback from the location of the impacted alarm to the workers on site.   In addition, the immediate audible alarm should also alert the driver of the errant vehicle and allow them to take corrective action to avoid the workers by stopping or redirecting the vehicle.

The intrusion alarm must be a stand-alone unit or in a series of units without electronic or physical connectivity.  The alarm must be capable of operating without electronic remote activation or requiring physical connectivity.   

Approximately 2500 units will be required for distribution in 100 sets of 25 units to state DOTs and various other agencies (Federal & local) for field trial use in actual conditions on projects.  The units will become the property of the recipients upon delivery for the demonstration.

This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The government believes only one responsible source can provide the service that will satisfy the agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested organizations may submit their products and qualifications specifically to meet the salient characteristics noted in this synopsis in writing to the point of contact not later than 3:00pm local time on September 4, 2006  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.   Order DTFH68-06-P-00176 will be issued to Paedia, LLC. on or about September 8, 2006.  The NAICS Code is 335999.     

Submittals should be sent to John Hunt, Federal Highway Administration, Central Federal Lands Highway Division, 12300 West Dakota Avenue, Lakewood, CO 80228.   Questions concerning this matter shall be in writing and may be sent via fax to (720) 963-3360 or to john.hunt@fhwa.dot.gov

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, A7K, 150 Vandenberg St., Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, FAX  719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil..

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. 
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>Structural Mechanics Branch, Code 652, of the Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCCD) is in the process of planning experiments that can significantly improve the submerged jet net thrust and overall propulsion efficiency using bubble injection in a divergent-convergent section of a waterjet. In support of this effort, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to DynaFlow, Inc. In previous awards, Dynaflow, Inc has worked with NSWC on similar projects; therefore changing vendors would increase the cost above the value of this procurement. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward t!  heir capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 09/05/2006.

This is a sole-source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The Government believes only one responsible source can provide the product that will satisfy the center's requirements.  This PCOS was based on specifications written in 1980s by KSC to meet the video and data requirements.  The system continues to be supported by (VPG) which has migrated to digital transmission technology in keeping up with current technology standards. The DVTS interfaces with the legacy data system which must have a one for one wideband transmission replacement to control KSC’s overall upgrade transmission cost.  VPG also offers new technology transport in addition to legacy replacement.  VPG infrastructure is currently installed on KSC as the DVTS which integrates with our optical patching and repeating system.  Employing hardware from another manufacturer would be incompatible with the existing wideband transmission infrastructure and capabilities would be greatly reduces.  This system is based on Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) study performed in 1998 by KSC as a feasibility study to reduce the fiber plant resource utilization resulting in cost savings to the Government.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial items using FAR Part 12.  Interested firms other than the sole source cited shall submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their qualifications/capabilities, providing a description in sufficient detail to show that the product offered meets the Government's requirement to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 01, 2006 at NASA/Kennedy Space Center, Attn: Marco Pochy, OP-OS, Kennedy Space Center FL 32899, fax to (321) 867-1188, or e-mail to marco.l.pochy@nasa.gov.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for SDS-100 Computer Servo-Controlled Direct/Residual Shear Testing System for Soils, 1 ea. NASA/KSC intends to purchase the item from Geotechnical Consulting & Testing Systems, P. O. Box 23686, Tempe, AZ  85285,The ISRU Excavation Analytical Tools & Concepts project is developing soil mechanics models for lunar soil.  The standard geotechnical measurements of cohesion that are used for terrestrial soil are too crude and not sufficient to identify the fundamental source and characteristics of lunar cohesion.	There are three types of direct/residual shear testers:  (1) Dead Weight, (2) Pneumatic, and (3) Hydralic.  The Dead Weight testers are not capable of performing the full range of research measurements that are needed, including specification of normal strain and various stress paths.  Pneumatic shear testers can be programmed, but tey are not sufficiently stiff to product the needed level of acccuracy at low confirement (normal load) conditions.  The only type of tester that will meet the requirement is a hydraulic system, because it is programmable for the complex stress/strain paths and yet it is sufficiently stiff to handl very weak confirement.  The hydraulic sheer testing system from Geotechnical Consulting & Testing Systems (GCTS) is the only known hydraulic/programmable shear tester with hydraulic normal load servo control. No other companies can manufacture or sell this type of system.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to barbara.y.powell@nasa.gov not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 30, 2006.

For this Technical Assistance, The Contractor will provide:

?	A high level integration plan/strategy to help inter-link the numerous databases and information systems; and
?	A detailed implementation plan and supporting requests for proposals, Terms of Reference (TOR), and budget estimates for all the major elements of the strategy

?	Integration Strategic Study
?	Implementation Plan
?	Preparation of All Procurement Related Documents and Specifications
?	Report on the Potential Development Impact of the Project

Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the Information Resource Center (IRC), USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.  Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source purchase order to Allentown Caging Equipment Co. Allentown, NJ  08501.    FDA will purchase 3 each of  Model no. MDJ7140MVSPCD3-3X 140 Cage Micro-Vent Environmental Unit, 7 each of Model no. PC75JMVCD Change cage, 5 each of Model no. PC75JMVSH Change cage, 3 each of Model no. MS10196U36MFPSH-1X Micro-Flo Environmental system, 2 each of Model no. GS292110UP8P Guinea Pig Rack and 2 each of 140 Cage Ventilated Racks. This equipment will be added to existing equipment manufactured by the contractor and will increase the holding capacity at the animal facilities at FDA.  Purchasing similar types of equipment will pose several problems for the consistency, efficiency, economy and operation of the animal facility.   This equipment also maximizes storage options, uniformity of the cage types and reduces the risk of animal caging being interchanged between the various types of automatic watering apparatus.  This is not a formal request for quotes.  However, evaluation of other offers and any award decision will be made on a best value basis. A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice solely within the discretion of the Government.  The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.  The non-competitive award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

The DTCI Pre-Proposal Conference is being conducted to provide interested parties the opportunity to identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition strategy, to ensure offerors have a firm understanding of the solicitation requirements, and to address any other industry concerns or questions.  The following is a brief synopsis of the DTCI requirement.  Specific DTCI requirements will be identified in performance work statement to be included in the upcoming solicitation.

DTCI is a CONUS transportation management initiative focused on increasing operational effectiveness while simultaneously obtaining efficiencies by reducing cycle times and using best practices, such as increased consolidations/load optimization and mode conversions.  The premise is for DoD to competitively award a long-term contract with a world-class transportation coordinator that will employ best commercial practices to achieve the goals stated above. The coordinator's scope goes beyond traditional freight forwarding and brokerage transactions.  The coordinator will leverage current commercial capabilities and proven best transportation practices of commercial shippers to manage, consolidate, and optimize specified CONUS freight movements using contractor-chosen modes among DOD shippers.  An implementation approach is envisioned with multiple phases based on location and possibly functionality.  It is anticipated Phase I will begin with 18 Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) CONUS Defense Distribution Centers.  Phase II will include co-located service shippers within a specified radius to achieve maximum volume participation and corollary cost savings through consolidation and optimization of freight requirements.  Phase III will include additional service shippers throughout CONUS. The DTCI coordinator must have visibility of targeted freight movement requirements across the CONUS and have immediate access to a nationwide network of transportation providers to schedule and fulfil those requirements.

<DESC>The Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS) is currently in production and being installed on board CH-46E helicopters flown by the U.S. Marine Corps.  The AIMS software performs the minimum requirements for Post Maintenance Check Flights, Periodic Maintenance Checks, identifying system(s) fault(s) and advising of CH-46E aircraft condition.  As a result of fielding these systems, the Government has identified a need for seven enhancements as follows: (1) Rotor Trim data accumulation and corrective action display, (2) Support Equipment reduction, (3) Engine Performance calculations and display, (4) Rotor Blade Tracker Enhancement,  (5) Dynamic Component Health Indicators, (6) Rotor Track and Balance Automated Troubleshooting, and (7) Engine Torque System improvements.  The intent of these enhancements is to build upon the successes of the AIMS program to date and will include upgrading the current AIMS proprietary software, making the current aircraft AIMS interface compatible with the new enhancements and possibly some hardware changes to the existing AIMS acquisition unit. This proposed effort shall be completed no later than 14 months after award and will be accomplished via a sole source modification to the existing AIMS production contract with Chadwick-Helmuth, a business unit of Honeywell, located in El Monte, CA.  As the original manufacturer of the AIMS hardware and software, Chadwick-Helmuth maintains the proprietary technical data and drawings which are required to perform this effort and other COTS products sold by this company.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Illumina Infinium HumanHap 300v1.1 Whole-Genome Genotyping Kit

Purpose/Brief History:

The GB is engaged in the study cancer genetics. Analysis of genetic alteration is an integral technique to the function of the GB. By using genotyping beadchip arrays to analyze copy number alteration, the GB is able to investigate the role that specific genes or groups of genes play to influence carcinogenesis and cancer progression in tumor and cancer cell line samples.

The required Single Nucleotide Polymorphism genotyping beadchip arrays consist of 50-mer oligos immobilized on microbeads embedded in an array format.  They are manufactured on custom slides and contain >317,000 target loci.

The proposed microarrays will be analyzed and scanned on our existing Illumina beadchip scanner.

 

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

Illumina is the only company that offers a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Genotyping Beadchip arrays, which consist of 50-mer oligos immobilized on microbeads embedded in an array format that are scannable on the GB?s Government owned Illumina BeadArray Scanner.  The beadchip arrays are manufactured on custom slides and contain >317,000 target loci.  Each oligo on the beadchip is present at a 30-fold redundancy for a statistically powerful result unavailable from any other manufacturer.  The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Genotyping Beadchip arrays allow analysis of both whole genomic copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity in the same analysis.  Illumina?s beadchip arrays are the only arrays, which are quality controlled at the manufacturer through a process of iterative hybridization that pre-qualifies all the elements on the array as being 100% functional.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Upgrade Maestro Spectroscopic Camera to Permit Calibrated Photon Counts for 	Quantitative Optical Imaging.

Purpose/Brief History:

The mission of the MIP is to develop targeted imaging agents for cancer detection.  They have developed a number of optical probes that specifically target cancers of the ovary and lung and are developing additional optical probes for other cancers.   The optical probes are fluorescent and require specialized instrumentation for detection called an In Vivo Fluorescence System which is able to detect tiny amounts of fluorescent signal.   
The MIP currently has an uncalibrated Maestro unit manufactured by Cambridge Research & Instrumentation, Inc. on which all experiments are performed.  The MIP designs probes using animal models of cancer imaged with the Maestro unit.  The purpose of this upgrade is to provide calibrated optical measurements.  It is necessary to provide quantitative comparisons of different optical probes to make comparisons among probes more objective.  The calibrated version upgrade of the Maestro unit is back-compatible with all our existing data yet is able to provide quantitative analysis in future experiments. 

The unit will be capable of performing spectroscopic optical imaging from approximately 450nm to 800nm in increments as small as 1nm.  The emission filter must be based on liquid crystal technology and be completely adjustable.  The light source and camera must be calibrated to yield photons/unit area.  The camera must be contained in a light-tight box that has built in excitation light that is adjustable by filtration.   The unit must come with its own customized software capable of acquiring spectroscopic ?cubes? and unmixing background fluorescence from target fluorescence.  The resulting images must be compatible with existing Maestro software formats.   

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

I.	All of the MIP?s existing data over the past two years is based on the Maestro unit.  To consider any other imaging device would mean that future comparisons would be made on a different device rendering scientific comparisons difficult.  Additionally, we are seeking a calibrated version of this in vivo imaging device which, to our knowledge, is not made by any other company.  The calibration will enable quantitative comparison of different probes.   It is necessary to provide more scientifically valid comparison of different tumor targeting probes.  Cambridge Research and Instrumentation is the only company that provides this kind of device that is fully back compatible with our current device allowing an upgrade to be performed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award to Livermore Software Technology Corp, Livermore, CA, on a sole source basis, for the purchase of proprietary LS-DYNA Software License (10 users) for one year. This is for the contin uation of already owned LSTC software that is currently in use.  Competing this requirement and awarding to any other source would result in substantial delays and disruption of license agreement and would also increase the overall cost to the Government.  This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for a competitive quote.  Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is:  lottie.morris@amedd.army.mil.

<CONTACT>ERIC VOKT, 435-831-2107
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Agency Dugway Proving Ground is soliciting for companies to provide a Real-time sensor or sampling system for detection of Methyl Salicylate (MeS) during a stimulant test protocol.  U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) has been awarded a project to investigate and develop the technology and sampler for real time sampling during the current system testing process, the Man-in-Simulant Test (MIST).  A follow-on phase II effort would be to extend this technology as a sampler for  both the swatch and agent/system testing processes.  From initiation of the contract to delivery of the prototype samplers will occur from inception of the contract until 31 December at the offerors site (or their subcontractor site).  Evaluation period o f the prototype samplers will occur at DPG from January through March 2007.  Offerors will provide 25 reusable or 75 non-reusable samplers and at least two set of sampler system data collection hardware and software, if the proposed system includes the dat a collection and transmission as part of the overall package.  Those systems that do not currently include this package will provide the specifications for output from the sampler to allow for the ability to integrate the sampler with existing data collect ion systems.  Samplers provided should be specific for MeS and meet the following technical spedifications: (a) Sampler technology must respond to exposure to the stimulant Methyl Salicylate (MeS) in challenge concentrations of 25±2.5 ng/m³; (b) Sampler te chnology must respond and clear down in less than 0.5 sec to an exposure; (c) Sampler must demonstrate capability to measure concentration of MeS present to within 10% of the measured value; (d) Sampler must provide a measurement with 95% Reliability and 9 5% Confidence over a range of detection from 25 ng/m³ to 1 mg/ m³ (T) 25 ng/m³ to 100 mg/m³.  Samplers must be able to make accurate, reliable measurements under conditions of 20  100% RH and 92-100 °C.; (e) Samplers are not required to be reused, unless reuse is required to meet Cost requirements.  If reusability is required to mitigate cost, samplers must demonstrate that they can be cleaned, recalibrated and meet sensitivity requirements for each successive use; (f)  Cost must not exceed current operati onal costs $60 per sample (T) at an individual location.  The goal is to reduce testing costs to at least $5 per sample (O) at an individual location.  Sampler may attain this requirement by a low-cost, single use sampler or a more expensive multiple use s ampler;  (g) Samplers must present no short term or long term health effects to the test participant.  Vendor must provide any MSDS information available; (h) Sampler must not allow a protrusion height of more than 0.15 inches (Threshold), 0.06 inches (obj ective).  Length and width of the sampler must not create interfere with  movement at critical locations (wrist, ankle, etc.); (i) Sampler technology must not affect the operational wear characteristics of the suit, i.e.  must not be so bulky as to cause b ulging in the suit, creating larger air gap than is normal, require increased airflow, induce heat or other energy under the suit or restrict movement of the wearer; (j) The sampler will be used under conditions of use and must continue to operate under th ese conditions.  Sampler and its associated equipment must not be effected by the movement (stretching, compression, rubbing and bouncing) inherent in the test;  (k) The samplers must maintain calibration for the duration of the entire testing process.  Sa mpler calibration requirements must be defined by the vendor and must not require calibration for at least 3 hours; (l) Excessive maintenance requirements for the system will limit its utility.  Sampler start up and  maintenance requirements must be define d by the vendor; (m) Format of the data outputs from the sampler is required so that the data collected may be integrated into the overall data collection schem a.  Data output format provided by the sampler must be identified by the vendor; (n)  The test protocol is designed to be conducted untethered, therefore telemetry of data at some point is required.  The information will be required to be collected remotel y from the measurement, so the vendor should identify any current telemetry capability, along with the specifications of the system used for collection.  If the system is not currently telemetered, signal output format and mechanism (i.e. wiring) must be s pecified so the sensor can be integrated with current data collection telemetry systems; (o) The system must demonstrate the capability to integrate with the current testing process and data collection process.  The offerer must provide information on the current use techniques for the sampler, including sample location techniques.  If the system does not provide a data output stream through an integral signal collection, reduction and data output process or system, the signal output from the system should be provided to allow for a determination of the compatability with the current electronic data collection systems and the potential for integration of the specific sensor into existing electronic data collection systems; (p) Sampler technology must require  a minimum amount of power to operate and must integrate with the current data collection systems being used for the MIST test (data should output from the sensor in analog or digital (preferred) format that can be collected on a data system); (r)  Include d in the offorer proposal should be a plan for the production of the samplers if accepted and validated for use.  Offorer should describe process used for production of current samplers and changes from this process required to meet production of these spe cific samplers.  If the samplers are not currently produced in any form a plan must be developed for ultimate production of samplers in larger quantities or as multiple systems.  These plans should include subcontractors that are or will be used to support  the effort and a description of their capabilities.  Up to three (3) offorer proposals will be considered for potential award. The requirement will be available on or about September 5, 2006 at the Army's Single Face to Industry web site (https://acquisit ion.army.mil).  Responses must be submitted not later than 5:00 PM MDT, September 26, 2006.

T he Corps will be involved in setting up these collection sites and will be awarding task orders from a contractor to provide temporary personnel that, once trained, can run these sites as well as open and close these sites throughout the mission with or wi thout Corps personnel.  Each collection site will typically have 2 or more individuals at each site.  There also may be a need to canvass designated locations throughout the declared areas which will include knocking on doors and explaining the temporary r oofing mission to those in need.  The contractor shall provide up to 100 individuals (those hired by the contractor) to assist in the ROE mission for the Corps Blue Roof Program in the areas affected by a hurricane which makes landfall in Florida, Puerto Rico, and/or the Virgin Islands.  In addition, the COR may request one administration support person to assist with spreadsheets, power point presentations, and word processing as requested.  Work could begin as soon as 24 hours after a storm makes landfal l but not later than 72 hours after landfall.  Work hours will be scheduled by the on-site COR, but are anticipated to be from 7:00 a.m. until 7:30 p.m. (up to 12 hours per day).  It is important to note that these individuals must be very flexible and w illing to work hard to accomplish the mission.  It is possible that one or more of the individuals will be requested to work at one collection site one day and then asked to move to another collection site the following day.  Collection sites will be openi ng and closing on nearly a daily basis, so the need for individuals to support this effort may decrease and increase within a 24 hour notice.  If it is determined by the Corps that an individual or individuals are incompetent and/or ineffective, then the C orps will request the contractor to remove this person within 8 hours of notice.  Each individual shall have their own transportation and are responsible for their own food and lodging.  One cell phone will be required by each individual.  On a case by cas e basis, Government cell phones may be issued to individuals for use during this mission.  Personal phone calls to friends and/or family will not be reimbursed.  Depending on the location/county in which the emergency temporary roofing is declared, the ind ividuals hired by the contractor may be required to be bilingual (one of which includes English).  Numbers of needed bilingual individuals will be determined by COR once the ROE mission begins.  For example, if Puerto Rico is in the strike of the hurricane  and the Corps is given a roofing mission, the Corps will be requesting that 100 percent speak both Spanish and English.  If the strike is located along the Panhandle, there may not be a need for anyone to be bilingual.  Individuals are required to read, w rite, and have the stamina to stand outside in extremely hot conditions.  These individuals must have high school diploma or equivalent.  The contractor shall be capable of increasing the workforce by 25% within a 24 hour notice.  The contractor should mak e their best effort in hiring local labor within impacted areas.  ROE forms shall be provided by the Government.  The reporting location(s) will be determined by the COR.  The Corps may request individuals to travel an excess of 100 miles when needed to drop off ROE forms or supplies and may include travel outside of the county in which the individual resides. Data Entry for ROEs.  In addition to the previous 100 individuals requested from the contractor, up to an additional 25 individuals will be needed for data entry to work during the night from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am.  These individuals must be able to type 40 or more words per minute and have basic understanding of computer skills such as database entry.  This will include entering ROE data into the database as well as organizing and filing ROE forms.  Work hours must be flexible.  The majority of this work wil l be input during the night; however, a fewer number of individuals will be needed to support Data Entry during the day with a 24 hour notice throughout the mission. Phone Bank for ROEs.  Up to 20 individuals will be needed to support phone calls from the public related to the ROE mission.  Corps will have designated phone bank locations setup to be used with a toll free number to answer all questions related to this mission.  Typical hours of operation will be 7:00 am until 7:30 pm (up to 12 hours per day).  Training.  On-site training will be provided by Corps employees before initiation of work. Period of Performance.  Estimated period of performance is 30 days. The government intends to award a fixed price indefinite quantity contract for these services for one year with four one-year options. The total ceiling price of the contract, with options, will be $5,000,000.00.  This acquisition is 100% set-aside for sma ll business under NAICS 561320, the size standard of which is $12.5 Million.

The Government intends to procure a seven-element antenna of approximately 14 inches in diameter.  The antenna must meet classified requirements.  The projected procurement quantity for the targeted platforms is approximately 234 production units, plus 10% spares, over the life of the contract (base year plus a maximum of four option years).  The initial quantity being required for delivery in Fiscal Year 06 (FY06) is approximately eight (8) R&D units.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334220.   The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation that will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) For Army Training and Doctrine Development Configuration/Training and Doctrine Development Tool (TDDC/TDDT) 11 August 2006 Version 0.6
Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is soliciting information on ways to provide the Army with a Training Development Tool utilizing an existing database consisting of tasks and training support plans developed by individual Army service schools.  The Army requires the ability to conduct analysis, design, and development of Army training products that are deposited into a centralized database. The centralized database of training products is available for discovery and delivery to users anywhere in the world. The training products developed support all levels of Army training and the three domains of Army training (Unit, Institutional and Self-development).
PEO STRI would also like information on how this provided capability would be maintained and fit within the Armys overall Training Information Architecture.

HISTORY:  The US Army develops, maintains and delivers training and Army doctrine to soldiers, teams and units deployed world-wide.  Training information includes courses, lessons, individual Soldier Training Plans, Combined Arms Training Strategies, and more.  Development of these products is based on tasks, which allow for the sharing of information between different products as appropriate and required.

The US Army Training Support Center (ATSC) developed a contract which was awarded to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in April 1999, to produce an integrated solution for Army training and doctrine development, storage and delivery based  on the Army Training Information Architecture Operational Architecture.  This contract delivered a list of Army training and doctrine requirements, an Army Training Information Architecture (ATIA), and integrated information systems (Army Training Information Architecture, Migrated, ATIA-M).  The ATIA-M is largely a series of web-based Java applications using an Oracle database.  The Training Doctrine Development Tool (TDDT), was developed in the NET framework to provide training and doctrine developers a standalone product development and maintenance capability.  The TDDT interacts with the server-based ATIA-M Training and Doctrine Development Configuration (TDDC) for information storage, discovery and sharing/reuse.

An  Oracle database, known as the Digital Library Data Repository (DLDR), was established to host the combination of about 26 individual Army service school training products.  The DLDR provides the ATIA-M common information source.  ATIA-M applications use the combined database for content development (TDDC/TDDT), storage (Digital Library Data Repository), discovery and delivery (Individual Training Configuration, ITC).  Training and doctrine developers currently use a combination of the Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT) that is connected with an individual Army service school database (Sybase) and MS Word which is used to periodically populate the DLDR.

TDDT and TDDC fail to meet requirements.  Functional testing of the TDDT application conducted in the spring of 2006 identified significant areas of needed functional improvement.  Subsequent performance testing of the TDDC also identified areas of needed performance improvement.  A copy of the functional testing after action report is provided at enclosure 6, copies of enhancement and change requests submitted as a result of functional testing are provided at enclosure 5.  A copy of the 14 July 2006 TDDC performance evaluation report is provided as enclosure 1.

As a point of reference, the Training and Doctrine Development Configuration Assessment for TRADOC, dated 14 July 2006, asserts that the underlying Enterprise Java Bean (EJB)-centric design is overly complex for the system requirements.  Generally, there are four conditions where use of EJB may be appropriate, and the requirements allocated to the Training and Doctrine Development Configuration fit none of these conditions.  Accordingly, it is prudent to consider other solutions, which may apply a more efficient design in terms of system performance, interoperability requirements notwithstanding.  The report also indicates potential issues with database design in terms of tables and indexes and usability in terms of work flow.

TDDT and TDDC have had limited collective task training development supporting Future Combat System (FCS) training in the past two (2) years.  Interfaces with other Army training information systems for retrieval of essential information are being developed with the ATIA-M data repository, to include: the Digital Training Management System (DTMS) for unit training management; and the Army Learning Management System (ALMS) for individual training management.  A copy of the ATIA-M/ALMS interface requirements specification is provided for reference at enclosure 7.  Future interfaces with the Training and Doctrine Development Management System (TD2) and Course Level Training Model (CLTM) are envisioned to support Department of the Army costing and resourcing requirements.  Other interfaces with doctrine repositories, the Army Training Requirements Reservation System (ATRRS), and more, are anticipated to be required.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this RFI is: to obtain information; assess industry capabilities; solicit industry comments/recommendations in order to provide a functionally and technically satisfactory Army training design and development capability; and to make a recommendation to the Army for an appropriate solution that considers suitability of the current solution, considers emerging technologies, information system interfaces and existing data repositories.  We anticipate three broad potential courses of action: fix current implementation; develop a hybrid solution of current implementation and new technology; and a new/replacement solution.  The proposed solution should address the following as a minimum:

·	Describe how the proposed solution is consistent with the current ATIA-M, and how it differs from the current ATIA-M TDDT/TDDC implementation; provide advantages and disadvantages of your solution.
·	Evaluate the ability of the proposed solution to integrate with the ATIA-M, based upon a minimum of level 1 interoperability as described in paragraph 5.1 of enclosure 2
·	Achieve business processes and provide capability to allow users to develop and render individual and collective training products as data objects, as outlined in the ATIA Use Case documentation provided at enclosure 3.
·	Training development requirements, and system performance requirements, provided at enclosure 4.
·	An agile software development methodology that accommodates changing requirements; providing iterative development and testing in advance of final testing, that should include performance load testing.
·	Implement a high-performing framework that is user friendly and functionally acceptable, and interacts with the established database of electronic Army training and doctrine products comprised of finished/published publications and task-based data objects that may be shared.
·	Single sign on capabilities using the Army Knowledge Online (AKO) for user authentication.
·	The capability for continuity of training developer workflow, regardless of network connectivity, without reliance on branch specific, or multiple standalone databases.
·	Migration of Service school data into the ATIA-M centralized database in a way that avoids unwanted data duplication.
·	Performance and functional testing of the proposed solution to ensure the optimal solution is available to the Government, and the proposed solution satisfies functional and performance requirements.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  Interested parties are requested to review the ATIA interoperability documentation, TDDC performance analysis, Change Request documentation and ATIA requirements.  Written responses are limited to 12 pages and should include a rough order of magnitude and projected schedule for work to be performed.  Specific review/input is requested in the following areas:

Administrative:

a.	Provide company name, points of contact with phone number.
b.	Every page should have the company name, header, page numbers, date and if applicable version number.

Technical:

a.  Current capabilities.  Describe the current capabilities of your company and how it could fulfill the requirements described above.  Provide examples of relevant, implemented applications to demonstrate capabilities as appropriate.

b.  Unique capabilities.  Describe any unique capabilities beyond that described above which could be applied to support the  development, sharing and maintenance of Army training products.

c.  Past performance.  Years of experience in requirements analysis; and developing and/or deploying information systems that support development, storage, discovery, sharing, maintenance, and delivery of training and/or doctrine products in such a way that the resultant products were not over-engineered, nor under-engineered.

Written response to this RFI should be provided by 1400 EST, Monday, 2 October 2006,  via electronic mail to Contract Specialist, Gloria Bailey at:  gloria.bailey1@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to issue a sole source procurement to  B & B Microscopes, Ltd., 535 Rochester Rd, Pittsburgh, PA under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This procurement is to obtain a FluoView FV1000 Confocal Microscope System.  This system has the ability to be attached to a current Olympus IX81 without any additional adaptations.  The optics has a high near infrared (IR) transmission allowing for less destruction to cells and better fluorescent signal return.  This automated system allows the user to choose the dye with the system making all necessary changes for a quicker gathering of data.  The system is very optically light efficient facilitating the use of low power on the laser which keeps cells alive longer and the bleaching rate on non-live cells to a minimum.  The Z resolution of the system is 10 nm.  It is the belief of the Government that there is currently only one responsible source capable of providing this equipment to satisfy the agency requirement.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This is not a request for competitive quotes; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the contracting officer within ten (10) days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  All responses must be in writing via e-mail to Cheryl.Weidner@med.va.gov or faxed to 412-365-5451.  If no responses are received, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System will proceed with the sole source procurement from Olympus America, Inc.

Description This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal but a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep-Space Surveillance System (GEODSS). The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation will be  issued on or about 10 Nov 2006, will include a draft  Performance Work Statement (PWS) and is posted for industry comment.  A best value source selection will be considered as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible for the Ground-Based Electro-Opticle Deep Space Surveillance System (GEODSS) optical sites located at Socorro New Mexico, Diego Garcia British India Ocean Territory, and Maui Hawaii.  The mission for GEODSS is to detect, track, and identify all tasked space objects within its area of coverage.  GEODSS provides metric data to the Space Control Center operated by the 1st Space Control Squadron at Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center, Colo.  Additionally, GEODDSS provides Space Object Identification to the USSTRATCOM Joint Intelligence Center at Offutt AFB, Neb.  The subsequent contract will include a projected sixty-day phase-in period (30 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008).  The Government  anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years.  Contract type has not yet been determined;  however, the current contract type is Fixed Price w/Performance Incentives.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is currently 517910.  Based on historical data, the solicitation is anticipated to be  a full and open competition.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman.  As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

<DESC>Due to the recent Congressional direction to move pets with evacuees, Air Mobility Command is preparing for the possibility that it may be called upon to assist with moving these pets via aircraft, in large quantities.

The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is exploring the availability of collapsible and disposable pet containers that can be flown on military cargo aircraft.  The intent is to palletize these kennels and pre-position them at key locations throughout the country.  If the need arises, the pallets can be loaded on the aircraft, built as required and then disposed of once the evacuation is complete.  This eliminates the need for the crew to clean, breakdown and store the kennels as they would with conventional products.  Kennels must be able to be secured using existing tie-down equipment, meet the basic standards for ventilation and accommodate a variety of sized animals typically kept as pets. 

This RFI may be followed by a request for proposal to conduct a Battlelab Concept Demonstration or purchase of products that respondents indicate will meet the requirements of this request.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request. 
NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product information may be submitted until close of business Friday, 22 September 2006.  White papers should not exceed five pages and should include cost estimates.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in Microsoft Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to the Air Mobility Warfare Center Battlelab at battlelab@mcguire.af.mil.  THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT CONCERNING THIS RFI IS CAPT JESSICA WILLIAMS.     Capt Williams can be contacted at (609) 754-7938 or jessica.williams2@mcguire.af.mil.
Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.     GENERAL AMB INFORMATION: The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.     We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.     The AMB strongly encourages partnering with companies to complete demonstrations through cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs), cooperative agreements, or bailment agreements, but does have a small budget to purchase COTS/GOTS-derived hardware.

GENERAL RFI INFORMATION:  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 15.201(e).  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.

<DESC>The Army Field Support Command is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources interested in the manufacture of M3A1 40 lb Shaped Demolition Charges (NSN: 1375-00-088-6691). The M3A1 40 lb Shaped Demolition Charge primary use is for borin g holes in earth, metal, masonry, concrete, and paved and unpaved roads.  When the charge is detonated, the explosive is converted to a compressed gas.  The gas exerts pressure in the form of a shockwave.  The main charge converts the shaped liner into a h igh speed jet charge, which penetrates the target.  It penetrates reinforced concrete to a depth of about 5 feet, with the diameter of the hole tapering from 5 inches at the mouth to 2.5 inches at the bottom. This charge consists of approximately 28.3 poun ds of Composition B, which is loaded using a melt-pour process. It also contains a 50 gram Composition A-3 booster charge. Both the Comp B and Comp A-3 will be provided as Government furnished material.  The manufacture of this shape charge requires specia l skills and facilities. Melt pour loading of high explosives is a critical technology.  Critical skills include laboratory personnel, explosive operators, quality assurance, environmental, and research and development. Critical facilities include temperat ure controlled cooling bays, melt pour systems, real time x-rays/x-ray technicians. X-rays are important to determine whether the melt-pour casting is free of cracks, voids, porosity, or separation.  Defects can cause malfunctioning of the charge and can b e life-threatening.  The explosive charge is enclosed in a sheet steel container with a steel cavity liner and a tin plated steel closing cap. The shaped charge assembly also has a carrying strap made of cotton webbing and a detachable three-legged steel p edestal. Finished charges are covered in a barrier material and packed in wooden boxes per drawing 7549165. Interested companies should respond by providing the government the following information: a brief summary of the company's capabilities, a description of facilities, business size information as it applies to NAICS code 325920 (size standard 750 employees ), personnel, past manufacturing experience (in similar items) as it relates to the above criteria, and availability (estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities and if resources to produce this item are shared with other productions lines) . 	A respondent to this survey should be able to show adequate technical and manufacturing capability and satisfactory past performance in the explosives industry. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc) av ailable, the respondent must be able to demonstrate his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of subtier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractor must also meet the criteria. Interested persons may notify the contracting officer their interest and capability within 30 days of this publication by providing your company's name, Address, Cage Code, Point of Contact, phone number and your E-mail address to US Army Field Support Com mand, ATTN: AMSFS-CCA-M, Ms. S Migawa, Bldg. 350 6th Flr. 1 Rock Island, Rock Island, IL 61299-6000, or request information by email:  stephanie.migawa@us.army.mil . This Market Survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request f or Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Command is seeking interested sources that have the capability to support Continuous Technology Refreshment (CTR) (previously known as Modernization Through Spares) as an effective method to reduce total ownership and support costs and resolve obsolescence issues through modernization of spare parts for AMCOM managed weapon systems.  CTR is an initiative intended to reduce operation and support costs and seeks to improve end item spares.  It is centered on performan ce- based requirements and must be accomplished within the operating budget available for procurement of spares.  The Army does not provide funds for initial investigation or qualification of new designs under this program.  The concept for this program wo uld require companies to enter into non-contractual agreements with the Command to exchange technical and requirements information in order to identify candidates appropriate for CTR.  No funds are available to support a contractual vehicle for this progra m.  Companies would have the opportunity to recommend candidates for the program based on the information provided.  Companies must be willing to develop business case analysis for the item and fund up-front investments required to develop/validate new des igns with an understanding that AMCOM cannot guarantee selection of a candidate or procurement of the new item in the future, however, should the candidate be procured, the company will have the opportunity to recover their investment as long as the costs do not exceed the current spares budget for that item.  The Business Case Analysis for an item will include the following: Total System Impact, Reliability Impact, Availability of the New Design, Obsolescence Avoidance, Repair/Maintenance Philosophy, Ov erall Cost Savings, and Logistic Footprint. Companies interested in this program must submit capability statements to include sustainment-engineering expertise directed in the areas of rotary wing aircraft and missile weapon systems and ground support equi pment for those systems.  The statement should include:  Technical approach, Key personnel with resumes, Facilities, equipment, tooling available, and Past performance history for similar work.  Teaming arrangements are encouraged to support this concept.  Capability statements will be evaluated based upon the following criteria: "	Degree of understanding of the technical aspects of spares and repairables and related issues  "	Demonstrated credibility of the proposed technical approach  "	Soundness of technical approach and proposed plan to optimize spares cost, schedule and performance "	Relevance and history of performing similar work  "	Availability of resources to successfully conduct the proposed work "	Key personnel qualifications "	Capability in performance based specification development  "	Analytical and manufacturing capabilities associated with applicable spares development (including qualification and test)  "	Suitability to perform as a future spares developer and integrator.   Responses should be directed to U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, ATTN:  AMSAM-AC-AL-L/Ms. D. Watson, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898.  Questions may be directed to Ms. Watson at 256-876-4250.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Pressure Transducers
<DESC>USDA/Natural Resources Conservation Service Oregon State Office is in the process of purchasing 60 Ea GE/Druck Precision Pressure Transducers (part number PMP 317-8693).  Half of these transducers will be a Pressure Range of 1 to 100 inch H2O and the other half will be 0 to 200 inch H2O.  These Transducers are built to USDA/NRCS SnoTel Drawings E-A3-8693 Rev D.  It is estimated that the cost of the procurement will be $38,100.00 FOB Origin.  USDA/NRCS Oregon is processing this procurement as a Sole Source under FAR 6.392-1(b).  USDA/NRCS Oregon needs to purchase these items from Druck in order to maintain consistency within the network (this is a follow-on procurement from previous years).  This type of transducer have been tested and certified by the Electronics Maintenance Facility of the USDA/Water and Climate Center (WCC).  We have been using these transducers as the replacement for existing transducers at all sites within the program, (not just the Oregon Staff), and for all new installations for the past 4 years.  By purchasing the transducers of the same part number the program is able to keep the consistency needed to collect quality data.  It is imperative that the same part be used at all sites.  The way the computer system is configure at the USDA/WCC, the data collected by the above mentioned transducer, is already programmed into the “Sensor Labels” program.  New transducers would require that new labels be developed after a period of testing.  This is a time consuming process, that isn’t needed when using already established transducers.

STANDARD COMPETITION INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT

NELLIS AFB 57th MAINTENANCE GROUP (MXG)

The 57th Wing Commander, Brigadier General William J. Rue, of USAFWC has announced a standard competition of 57th MXG, aircraft and maintenance repair.  It affects a total of 792 DoD personnel (11 officers, 709 enlisted, 72 civilians).  The standard was announced on 22 August 2006 and is projected for completion by February 08.  The Component Competitive Sourcing Official is Lieutenant General Roger A. Brady, the Contracting Officer is Captain Daniel Boeh, and the Agency Tender Official is Colonel Charles Q. Brown.  

This standard competition will be conducted in compliance with the Air Force policies in AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program that implements the Office of Management and Budget (OMBC) A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities.  This Circular reaffirms the government’s policy to rely on the private sector for needed commercial services.  To ensure that the American people receive a maximum value for their tax dollars, commercial activities should be subject to the forces of competition.

When a competition between in-house and contract performance determines contracting is more cost effective, OMBC A-76 and Federal acquisition Regulation require the contractor to offer adversely affected civilian and NAF employees the Right of First Refusal for employment openings to positions (under the contract) for which they qualify.  Since DoD is sensitive to the personal impact this action may have on civilian employees, the DoD Program for Stability of Civilian Employment ensures every effort is made to help adversely affected civilian employees who desire placement assistance.  These employees may be registered in the Defense-wide computerized Priority Placement Program.  Registrants under this program receive placement rights to vacancies within DoD (other Federal agencies are also solicit4d).  When adversely affected civilian employees must relocate to continue Federal employment, the government pays transportation and moving expenses.  If you have any questions, please contact either Captain Daniel Boeh at (702) 652-9119 or Captain Micah O’Neal at (702) 652-5401.

BIOBRIEFCASE – A PORTABLE INSTRUMENT FOR AUTONOMOUS DETECTION OF BIOAGENTS
Contracting Office Addresses

AND

Department of Energy, Sandia Corp. (DOE M&O Contractor), Sandia National Laboratories, 7011 East Avenue, P.O. Box 969, Livermore, CA 94551

Opportunity

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), operated by Sandia Corporation under contract with DOE, are seeking industrial partners to commercialize LLNL/SNL's portable autonomous bioagent detection system – BioBriefcase and to cooperate with LLNL/SNL team on the final design, manufacture and commercialization of  the BioBriefcase.  This announcement is a modification of previously published 
FBO 126-06.

Background

Lawrence Livermore and Sandia National Laboratories are partnered to produce a compact, multiplexed, autonomous, broad-spectrum bioagent detector for the U.S. Goverment.  The BioBriefcase is being designed to monitor the environment and provide “detect-to- treat” capability for civilian applications, and could be deployed to upgrade the current system of  bioaerosol monitors that were deployed under the BioWatch program.  The BioBriefcase features rapid response, multiplexing capability, small reagent consumption, and relatively low cost, with high sensitivity in a short response time.  This technology is being evaluated by the Government under the consideration of further funding opportunities for the next stage of research and development.  The success of this technology may result in significant federal procurement to manufacture BioBriefcase for the government.  


 
Description
Currently, LLNL/SNL are seeking one or more industrial partners with proven experience in Homeland Security technology to work with us on the continued development and testing of the BioBriefcase, and to provide a clear path to commercialization through product development and manufacturing.  The partners will fund collaborative R&D under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to work on design improvements, optimization for manufacturing, technology maturation, Quality Assurance and related commercialization issues. To compete successfully for this opportunity, companies must demonstrate expertise in biochemical assays (including DNA analysis); must have a demonstrated capability or credible plan to manufacture >1000 instruments per year; must ensure substantial US manufacturing;
must have experience in manufacturing, marketing and distributing of relevant devices in the homeland security or defense market; must have demonstrated capability to produce analytical instrumentation with a list price of  >$10,000 for chemical/biochemical analysis that includes wetted fluid paths; must have demonstrated capability or credible plans to supply consumables for the support of thousands of fielded instrumentation biochemical analysis; must have demonstrated ability to provide training, service and support of analytical instrumentation for chemical/biochemical analysis in the US market.   We expect partners to invest in joint development and exploit commercial markets for sales of the BioBriefcase in addition to sales to the government that may result from federal procurements.  We therefore expect partners to license intellectual property, including the payment of licensing fees and royalties based on commercial sales.  

Please provide your written statement within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL/SNL's BioBriefcase technology. 

Companies interested in partnering with LLNL/SNL on the further development and commercialization of the BioBriefcase technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following: 

1. Company Name and Address 
2. The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact 
3. A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology, in response to the description provided above.

Please visit the IPAC website at: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.

<SUBJECT>61 -- FPI Sales in FSC Code 6160
<DESC>This notice announces a decision by the Board of Directors for Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) to waive FPI?s status as a mandatory source of supply for items within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 6160 - Miscellaneous Battery Retaining Fixtures/Liners.  FPI will continue to produce items within FSC code 6160, however, all sales FPI obtained for those items will be through non-mandatory means.  This decision is effective immediately.  This decision is the result of an earlier resolution by FPI?s Board to limit the application of mandatory source to products for which FPI?s share of the Federal market is less than 20 percent.
					
Mandatory source is prescribed by law.  In the past, the Board has exercised its authority to administratively determine how the statute should be applied.  It is within the Board?s authority to determine the conditions under which waivers of FPI?s mandatory source are to be applied.
The following guidance is being provided to facilitate the customer implementation of this action.

C  For products where FPI has waived the application of mandatory source, the market share acquired by FPI without the benefit of the mandatory source is considered a reasonable share. 

C     For those FSCs where FPI?s mandatory source is waived, FPI must be given full visibility of the requirement and afforded a fair and equitable opportunity to submit an offer to meet the customer?s requirement, to include being provided by Federal agencies the same information and specifications (as are afforded to any private sector offeror).

C  Such waiver is contingent upon FPI?s ability to submit an offer for these procurements.  Thus, consistent with the provisions of the Final Rule Implementing Sections 811/819 of the Defense Authorization Act of 2003(Federal Register, November 14, 2003), such procurements must not be set aside for other programs, e.g., small business set-aside, nor may FPI be otherwise precluded from being able to submit an offer.

C  Notwithstanding the fact that customers are no longer required to purchase products from FPI as a result of the Board resolution limiting the application of mandatory source to products for which FPI?s share of the Federal market is less than 20 percent, there is absolutely no restriction or prohibition against the customers continuing to purchase from FPI, should they choose to do so of their own volition.  Thus, customers that currently rely on FPI to meet their product needs may continue to utilize FPI under the Board?s resolution.

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI?s Board of Directors.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureaus of European Affairs and International Organizations Executive Office (EUR-IO/EX).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Hewlett-Packard Proliant DL380 G4 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State Automated Data Processing requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. EUR-IO/EX requires equipment to replace its aging file-print and application server inventory and has identified the Hewlett-Packard Proliant DL380 G4 Server.  EUR-IO/EX used older HP Proliant equipment and must have HP equipment to be able to use previously procured hard drives and spare equipment.  A HP Proliant DL380 was quoted to IRM/ITI/PMA in the Department of State at $7,200 each.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Hewlett-Packard Proliant DL380 Server has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for GITM deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.  EUR-IO/EX would like to maintain the equipment standards set by the Information Resource Management Global Modernization IT infrastructures recommendations. A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. FOB DESTINATION CONUS

FOB DESTINATION CONUS This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Cisco Catalyst Switches.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the Cisco Catalyst Switch as a key component of the Department’s Firewall Infrastructure.  The above listed equipment is required to interface with recently upgraded secure proxy devices that were purchased to replace obsolete models that were unable to handle the increased circuit bandwidth from T3 to OC3 levels.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s firewall networking infrastructure.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The use of brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure requirements, and continuity of current operations, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. 2.   A description of the supplies or services required meeting the agency’s needs. RM/GFS/GS has identified the HP Hardware listed below as key components of the Department’s Financial Management System.   •	HP 10642 42 U Standard Rack Pallet (P/N 245161-B21) is required because of its size. The 10642 G2 rack is a 42U rack which is 42 U high, 600mm / 23.62 in (wide), and 1000mm / 39.37 in (deep).  It is essential that we purchase a rack with these measurements to maintain the continuity of the Operations Center; these dimensions are required for the racks to function properly with the Liebert XDV rack mounted air conditioning units installed in the data center. •	HP KVM CAT5-PS/2 console (P/N 262587-B21) is required it maintains continuity of existing hardware and can be easily exchanged within the operations and saves the department significant costs due to replacement of spare parts and extended warranties. •	HP 0x2x16 IP console switch (P/N 336045-B21) is required because it provides all of the following benefits: 1.	0U mounting (zero U - i.e. takes no space away from servers) 2.	Remote management via iLO (HP's proprietary Integrated Lights Out) 3.	Simplified cable management - CAT5 cables much smaller than typical KVM cables 4.	Supports tiering or cascading up to 256 servers 5.	Supports 2 simultaneous users 6.	Integration with HP IP Console switch - minimum reconfiguration needed if/when we switch to remote IP consoles 7.	All of the existing console switches are HP which helps simplify the repair process. This is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s Financial Management System.

Nature and/or description of the action being approved:   This justification is for the purchase of an Enterprise License Agreement upgrade for our current Search Engine (Autonomy). This enterprise license for Autonomy products will give the Department of State unlimited usage and additional functional capabilities, as required.  Such capabilities include the use of desktop search tools, support for rich media (voice and video), and multiple languages. This upgrade is for a perpetual license with annual support for four years from the date of acquisition. Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs: As the lead federal agency responsible for the conduct of U.S. foreign affairs, the Department of State helps to shape a freer, more secure, and more prosperous world through formulating, representing and implementing American foreign policy. The enterprise license upgrade of the Department existing Autonomy enterprise license will allow the Office of eDiplomacy, Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM/BPC/EDIP) to accomplish the following objectives in support of the Department’s mission: •	implement additional search features to improve the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval for foreign service officers, •	provide integrated services on the desktop and primary tools for knowledge management to make it easier to locate information assets, and •	complement key programs such as State Messaging Archival and Retrieval System (SMART). The expanded license privileges will assist eDiplomacy in meeting the above objectives. Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  IAW FAR 8.405-6, this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. Demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:  This justification is directed towards the expansion of the existing Autonomy license, to include additional functional capabilities of the Autonomy IDOL Server, access to currently Autonomy major upgrades, unlimited usage rights, and 4 years of Autonomy annual maintenance.  The only offering available to satisfy these requirements, given that the Autonomy product is already licensed and deployed in production use at the Department, is the proposed Autonomy license enhancements and maintenance. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: This acquisition is being conducted under a GSA schedule.  Synopsis is not required in accordance with FAR 8.404.  .  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the      Government will be fair and reasonable: The Contracting Officer anticipates that the price to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  A complete analysis of the contractor’s prices will be performed in accordance with applicable FAR provisions.  Commercial price lists, procurement history and other available pricing information will be reviewed.  A determination of fair and reasonable pricing as required by statute and regulation will be made by the Contracting Officer. 7.	Description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted: Analysis of available technologies was originally conducted in 2002, prior to the original acquisition of Autonomy by the Dept. of State in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).   The existence of the Autonomy software as the foundation for Dept. of State search technology requires that the desired license expansion and support be Autonomy based as well. Since Autonomy has already been purchased and implemented within the Department of State, there is no need to do further market survey for the Autonomy upgrade and maintenance purchase. However, recent research review of independent analysis of search technologies, conducted by research firms including Gartner, Inc., consistently rank Autonomy as a leading vendor in this space.    Autonomy has the largest installed based of any such intranet search product and has consistently achieved Gartner’s ‘leader’s quadrant’ honors. According to Gartner, vendors listed in the leader's quadrant are performing well today, have a clear vision of market direction and are actively building competencies to sustain their leadership position in the market. 8.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. eDiplomacy has successfully implemented Autonomy as the intranet search tool for the Dept. of State and, as such, has invested significant resources in achieving that result.  Utilization of any alternate technology would require additional license expenditures, additional services costs, and significant implementation delays.  Such costs and delays would adversely impact Dept. of State operations. Sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: 	No written expressions of interests have been received. 10. Actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to      competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services         required. As this justification relates to the upgrade of an existence license, for a specific software brand, no actions are required to remove or overcome barriers to competition. 11. Background Information: In 2002, the U.S. State Department created a new initiative for knowledge-sharing placed with Foreign Affairs Information Integration (FASI) office called the “Interagency Collaboration Zone” of which ‘search’ was an integrated component.  This project used the Autonomy search engine as a principle tool for finding and retrieving information. In 2004 upon conclusion of the FASI pilot the IRM Business Center assumed ownership for the Autonomy search engine enterprise license for use with the Enterprise Information Portal (EIP) project.  Responsibility for the EIP initiative was eventually transferred to the Office of eDiplomacy since it was a core component of the organization’s knowledge management objective.  In the beginning of this project, IRM had a critical business need to improve the search capabilities of their Intranet (“iNet”) page; therefore ‘search’ became the initial project undertaken as part of the EIP project. The original acquisition by the State Department of the Autonomy license was part of a larger acquisition done by the newly formed Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2002. Autonomy was awarded the newly Enterprise Homeland Security Contract to provide 21 agencies within the newly formed Department of Homeland Security with the core infrastructure technology for information collection, analysis, routing and retrieval. Now since the Department has an Enterprise License Agreement for Autonomy, eDiplomacy’s first and foremost charge was to upgrade the existing search tool housed within the Intranet (iNet) web page with a faster and more powerful engine that would greatly improved intranet searching. The search engine project has concluded Phase 2 which included the replacement of the Alta Vista search engine, and the CA and FAM pilot, and has moved into the third phase of the initiative. The new Autonomy search engine went live January, 2005. Based on our positive experiences working with Autonomy it is appropriate that we continue to utilize Autonomy and expand the current maintenance agreement to include all unlimited usage rights/capabilities/upgrades of the enterprise license for Autonomy products. The Department of Homeland Security and Department of State Enterprise License Agreement contract expired at the end of September 2005. As mentioned earlier, Autonomy is the Department of State Intranet enterprise search engine.  Each of the 21 agencies who originally participated in the 2002 agreement are now individually responsible for securing and maintaining Autonomy license and annual support, as DHS has not renewed such license support at the Department level.  Even though the original license agreement has expired, we can continue to use the product, however, our initiative (continued pursuit for improvements) will be in jeopardy due to the inability to take advantage of any new patches and upgrades for the Autonomy Search Engine, as well as discontinued support for the version of the software that is currently in use at the Department. All questions must be received by Sep 5, 2006.  The RFQ number and contractor’s business name must be typed in the subject line.  Questions received after that date may not be answered.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued separately.  The solicitation number is FA5000-06-T-0067. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated FAR provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12 and Class Deviation 2005-o0001. The DFARS provisions and clauses are those in effect to DCN 200600814.  Purchase SIB broom cassette (part# SIB/MB-18/28-05) for MB Broom with 28 row Svenska cores.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS FOR BRAND NAME ONLY.  THERE IS CURRENTLY NO FUNDING FOR THIS ACQUISITION AND NO GUARANTEE FUNDING WILL BECOME AVAILABLE.  The intended source of this requirement is Myslik, Inc., as this is the only authorized dealer of SIB Broom Cassette in North America.  The SIB core comes with nylon inserts designed to absorb all the wear that the extrusions have incurred with replacement cost being a fraction of that expense.  Nylon insert replacement is now required and is available on the new SIB core which has a five year warranty.  In order to maintain the 5-year warranty for these cores, SIB cassettes must be used with these cores.  Use of other brands would void the warranty and cause excessive wear to the core.  Prior to 2005, broom cassettes were solicitated as ?brand name or equal? but because of the damage sustained to the runway sweepers, it has been determined that brand name is in the best interest of the government.

                                   EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held - 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:
__ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

FEDERAL RECORDS CENTER PLATFORM LADDER SPECIFICATION
PURCHASE DESCRIPTION
LADDER, ALUMINUM, ROLLING, PLATFORM/PULPIT TYPE

  General.  This purchase description covers: (1) a special aluminum rolling platform ladder, with pulpit, designed for manual movement on concrete floors within 36-inch nominal width service aisles in shelving installations with 15-box-high records storage at Federal Records Centers (FRCs), and (2) a special aluminum rolling platform ladder, with pulpit, designed for manual movement on concrete floors within 28-inch nominal width service aisles in shelving installations with 15-box-high records storage at Federal Records Centers (FRCs).

  Model.  The ladder shall be a 9-step model conforming in all respects to this purchase description and the attached ladder drawings.

  Design.  A manufacturer's tolerance of plus or minus1/8th inch shall be permitted for all ladder measurements identified herein as critical to records center operations.

  Steps.  With the exception of the top platform step, the ladder steps shall not be less than 9 inches or more than 10 inches deep by not more than 1 inch thick (including the tread).  The distance between the steps, measured from top surface to top surface, shall be 12 inches.  This uniform spacing provides 11 inches of clear vertical space between the steps, and allows each step to serve as a ?shelf? to access files housed in standard size FRC boxes 10 inches high.  The top platform step shall be 14 inches deep by 1 inch thick.  The width of the steps shall conform to the taper of the sides of the ladder (drawings available upon request).  The thickness, depth, and spacing measurements for the steps are specified as critical to records center operations.

  Pulpit Filing Shelf.  The filing shelf shall be fabricated from aluminum sheet, 1/8th inch nominal thickness, and shall have a flat, smooth top surface.  Its size shall be 12 inches deep by 21 inches wide by 1 inch thick for 36-inch ladders and 12 inches deep by 15 inches wide by 1 inch thick for 28 inch Ladders.  It shall be mounted permanently on the upper guardrail and shall overlap the top step by not more than 3 inches.

  Swivel Casters.  Each ladder requires four spring-loaded swivel casters with 3-inch diameter wheels.  The casters shall conform to Bassick model number WL13698MX282RP or equal.  Casters shall have a bolt, rivet, or bushing axle.   They shall be in suitable housing welded to the ladder frame, fully operational, in a manner that permits caster replacements using simple hand tools.  The stem of each caster shall be mounted so that when a user's weight is applied to any step, the springs on all four casters shall compress  allowing all legs of the ladder to rest on the floor.

  Housing for Caster Shaft and Spring.  The cited Bassik (or equal) caster is without shaft housing and spring.  Housing for the caster shaft and spring may be fabricated from aluminum pipe of ? inch nominal diameter.  The housing shall be welded to the ladder frame.  The caster springs shall be designed so that when the ladder is unloaded they shall have sufficient force to return the ladder to the raised mobile position.  The springs shall have a fatigue life capable of withstanding a minimum of one million full cycles of ladder deflections.

  Bracket for Shaft Housing.  The shaft housing for each caster shall be reinforced with a 1/8 inch thick formed angular aluminum bracket welded to the shaft housing and frame of the ladder at the intersection of the front and back base cross braces as shown in Figure 1 .(available upon request). 


  Guide Rollers.  Four rigid guide rollers are required for each ladder.  The guide roller wheels shall be mounted on custom-made, aluminum, angular, brackets that will also serve as axle housing for the wheels as shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. 2, 3, and 4 available upon request).  The bracket shall be 3/8 of an inch thick aluminum, 2-1/2 inches wide at both the ladder and non-ladder corners, and with a 2-1/2 inch length projection from the base of the ladder to the furthermost point on the bracket.  The brackets shall be tapered at the corners of the ladder, and shall provide housing for both ends of the axles of the guide roller wheels.

  Brackets.  The brackets for the guide rollers shall be welded to the ladder at the outer corners of the base at both the ladder end and at the non-ladder end.  The weld shall be 2-1/2 inches wide to match the width of the bracket and must be strong enough to withstand repetitive bumping of uprights within rows of installed steel shelving.  Each ladder shall have two guide roller assemblies (one on each corner) at the ladder end and two guide roller assemblies (one at each corner) at the non-ladder end.

  Wheels .  The guide roller assemblies shall have 2-inch diameter wheels of hard rubber composition.  The wheel thickness shall be 3/4th of an inch, plus or minus 1/8th of an inch.  Oval head bolts with special self-locking type nuts shall be used as axles.  The lock nuts shall be installed on the down side of the customized housing bracket.  With the ladder in the raised position (unloaded), the topmost point of the axle oval head shall not be more than 2-3/4th inches above the floor surface.  This limitation allows the guide assemblies to roll along the bases of installed shelving and not damage the boxed records stored on the bottom shelves at 3 inches above the floor surface.  The 2-3/4th inch high measurement is critical to records center operations.  The overall 34-inch width for the guide rollers, as shown on the drawings (available upon request), is specified in order to meet critical operational tracking movement of the ladders within 36-inch nominal width service aisles.

 Braces at Ladder Base.  To strengthen the 36-inch ladder, three aluminum pipes, approximately 27 inches long each, shall be welded across the frame of the ladder at its base.  To strengthen the 28-inch ladder, three aluminum pipes, approximately 20-1/4 inches long each, shall be welded across the frame of the ladder at its base.  These pipes shall be welded at the following approximate locations:  (1) across the center of the ladder, (2) indented 8 inches from the ladder end (at the front swivel casters), and (3) indented 8 inches from the non-ladder end (at the back swivel casters).

  Construction.  As a minimum, the ladder shall be capable of safely sustaining two individuals with a combined weight of 400 pounds plus a 50 percent overload factor.  Each step shall be capable of supporting 200 pounds plus a 50 percent overload factor.  The pulpit file shelf shall be capable of supporting 60 pounds plus a 50 percent overload factor.

  Method.  The ladder shall be all-welded construction and shall be furnished fully assembled for immediate use.

  Materials.  The ladder frame, rails, and diagonals shall be at least ?-inch nominal pipe size and not more than ? inch nominal pipe size (inside dimension), schedule 40 aluminum pipe.  Aluminum shall be of alloys 6061, 6063, of a T4, T5 or T6 temper at the manufacturer's option.

  Steps .  All steps shall be fabricated from aluminum, of 1/8th inch nominal thickness.  The step treads shall be corrugated, ribbed, dimpled, embossed, knurled, or other non-slip configuration except serrated.  Step thickness overall shall not exceed one inch.

  Pulpit Filing Shelf.  The pulpit-filing shelf shall be fabricated from aluminum sheet, 1/8th inch nominal thickness, and shall have a flat, smooth top surface.

  Legs .  The legs of the ladder shall be equipped with reinforced rubber tips to prevent it from rolling or slipping when loaded.

  Finish.  The aluminum finish shall be the manufacturer's standard mill unpainted finish and shall be free from burrs, sharp edges, and oily substances.

  Step Spacing.  The top surface of the bottom step shall be 12 inches above the floor when the ladder is in the down position (loaded).  The distance between shelves shall be 12-inch nominal measurement from top surface to top surface.  The clear vertical space between the steps (11-inch nominal measurement) is critical to records center operations.  Step overlap shall be approximately 5 inches.

  Inspection.  Prior to payment, all ladders ordered must meet the requirements of this purchase description, with inspection to be performed FOB destination unless otherwise specified by the Contracting Officer of the National Archives and Records Administration.

  Packaging.  Packaging shall be in a manner that prevents damage to the ladders during shipment, including damage to the guide rollers, casters, steps, filing shelf, legs, frame rails, diagonals, finish, etc.

  Delivery.  Delivery requirements shall be FOB destination.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-06-1008, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $6 million.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Services (NICHD), has a requirement to procure laboratory services for four Epidemiology Branch studies that include the following.  


A. Effects of Smoking on Circulating Angiogenic Factors
The objective of this study is to validate smoking histories by quantitative measurement of cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, in urine obtained 3 times during pregnancy in 2200 women randomly selected from the Calcium for Preeclampsia Prevention cohort for whom serum angiogenic factor concentrations have already been obtained.  We wish to determine women who were exposed only to sidestream smoke and those who were themselves active smokers in addition to the women who never smoked.

B. Hormonal Indicators of Onset of Puberty and Their Relationship to Blood Lead Levels in Children Ages 6-11
The objectives are to measure LH, inhibin B, and testosterone in stored serum obtained in NHANES III 1988-94 to determine in boys and girls whether there has been a decline in the age at puberty and whether age at puberty is related to blood lead level.

C. Cytokines, Chemokines and the Menstrual Cycle:
The objective is to measure 21 cytokines and chemokines in serum obtained 8 times per menstrual cycle over 2 cycles from 250 women who participated in the BioCycle Study.  The purpose is to determine whether variation in cytokines and chemokines is correlated with variation in concentrations of estrogen, progesterone, LH, and FSH; to menstrual cycle lenth; or to ovulation.

FAR 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2006) is incorporated by reference and applies to this acquisition.  The provision at 52.212-2 EVALUATION—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) is incorporated by reference and applies to this acquisition with the following inserted information under paragraph (a):  The following factors shall be used to evaluated offers:

The Government intends to award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, considering technical factors and price.  The following technical factors will be evaluated and are listed in descending order of importance:
 
(1)  Technical Approach 
(2)	 Past Experience/Performance.     

Technical Approach:     
Technical proposal shall be no longer than 6 typed pages (12pt font), excluding pictures, illustrations,  drawings, and copy of AvL quote.  It must include a detailed description of the product and all of its capabilities.  It must include an overview of similar systems and some of the customers using them.  It must include pictures of the system, single line drawings, and similar systems.  A copy of Avl’s quote (price may be deleted) is required to ensure all of the features of the special NAVAIR version are being provided.   It must describe your knowledge and understanding of the technical requirements and identify the methodology and analytical techniques you will use to manage the work and ensure that all SOW requirements are met.  Offers will be evaluated on the demonstrated ability to provide a technical approach that integrates the tasking into a cohesive effort that can be accomplished with minimal risk.   

Required Past Experience/Performance Documentation:
The offeror shall provide a narrative of at least two (2) projects for similar tasks as required by this SOW and at least two (2) years of experience producing similar products within the past three (3) years.  If the offeror will subcontract any significant part of this effort, the offeror must provide a narrative of at least two (2) projects for similar tasks for those subcontractors.  The offeror shall provide applicable contractor names, contract numbers, contract dollar values, description of product provided, and periods of performance.  Each narrative shall also include the name, area code and phone number, mailing and e-mail address of the person from each identified contractor who can verify the offerors past experience/ performance.  The Past Experience/Performance Documentation shall be no longer than 3 typed pages (12pt font).  The Government will conduct reference checks on performance, customer satisfaction with respect to technical quality of product provided, ability to meet contractual schedules, management responsiveness, and cost control.  The Government will also evaluate the relevance of the offeror's past experience/performance compared to the requirements specified in the SOW.  The Government may supplement the information you provide with performance information it may obtain from any other reliable source including its own experience with your firm (or Subcontractor).  Offerors unable to fully demonstrate they have successfully completed two (2) similar tasks to this SOW in the past three (3) years will be considered to be a higher risk to the Government and as a result may not be considered for award.	

The technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  However, to the extent that the offers become more equal in the technical and past performance factors, then price takes on added significance.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-12.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  

This acquisition is being procured using full and open competition.
 
The Mass & Force Group of the Manufacturing Metrology Division at NIST maintains and disseminates the National Kilogram Standard for the United States of America.  As part of its mission, it is currently involved in research to develop a new method for vacuum mass measurements.  A 10-kilogram vacuum mass comparator with integrated weight handler (vacuum balance) and separate weight handler (weight handler) are required for this purpose.  

The vacuum balance and weight handler will be installed inside a NIST-provided vacuum chamber setup.  As such, the Vendor shall provide to NIST key dimensions needed to install the vacuum balance and weight handler inside the provided vacuum chamber setup (which is to be purchased).  The specifications of the vacuum balance and weight handler follow.

The Government notes that the vacuum chamber setup has been designed, however, has not been manufactured to date.  NIST intends to manufacture the vacuum chamber within sufficient time to allow delivery and installation of the vacuum balance and weight handler to be installed inside of the vacuum chamber.  The design of the vacuum chamber shall be adjusted based on the dimensions of the vacuum balance and weight handler selected.  

A design drawing of the vacuum chamber can be provided by e-mail.  Quoters must submit a written request for the drawing to Contract Specialist Carol Wood at carol.wood@nist.gov.

Installation of the vacuum balance and weight handler into the vacuum chamber will be negotiated at a later date.  Reference the “ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT” section of this solicitation.

All interested parties shall provide a quote for the following line items:

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Department of State approved Cisco IT equipment.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements and compatibility with existing operational equipment across the Global DoS Enterprise. Infrastructure connectivity requirements preclude consideration of the products of another company that may produce an incompatibility risk to the Enterprise.  DS/CTO/CPA has identified Cisco IT Equipment as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Cisco IT equipment is required to provide compatible configuration for network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network equipment; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  The Cisco IT equipment have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for DS deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board and DS IT Review Board.

			Note:  Presence of the Branch Chief level is dependant on the 					Units organizational structure.

	Sub-Unit Level:
		Division Chief; Single Digit Identifier.  Generally the administratively 				assigned sub-unit number.  
			Note:  Interagency Units and Units which have combined ranger 				districts may need to generate a division numbering sequence 				based on geographic responsibility of the Division Chief.

		Battalion Chief; Two Digit Identifier.  The first number is the Division 				designation, the second number is the sequence for number of BC 				positions in the Division.
			Example:  BC 11 Identifies Division 1 Battalion Chief 1
				      BC 12 Identifies Division 1 Battalion Chief 2

		Lieutenant; Two Digit Identifier.  The first number is the Division 					designation, the second number is the sequence for number of LT 				positions in the Division.

		Engine; Two Digit Identifier.  The first number is the Division 					designation, the second number is the sequence for number of 				engines in the Division.

		Crew; Three Digits Identifier.  The first number is the Division 					designation, the middle digit is a place holder, and the last digit is the	sequence for number of crews in the division.
		
		Prevention:  Two Digit Identifier; The first number is the Division 					designation, the second number is the sequence for number of PT 				positions in the Division.

		Other Resources:  For dispatch and communication purposes other 					resources would be identified by type of resource and appropriate 				designator.
			Example:  Dozer 11, HC Chase (helicopter Hotel Charlie support 					truck), etc.

Rationale for Recommendations:

The recommendation provides:

??	A consistent implementation of marking for safety which is compliant with NFPA 1906 standard, as applied by other fire service organizations.

??	Consistent recognized color scheme and organization identification for FS/BLM fire resources.  The white vehicle package meets the shift of both agencies to the procurement of white vehicles from the manufacturer.  The green vehicle package meets the needs for older FS ?green fleet? and BLM ?green? engine color. 

??	Allows for Agency affiliation through use of agency emblems, and meets agency marking requirements for all fleet.

??	Unit identification utilizing nationally recognized mnemonics documented in Regional Mob Guide.  Provides for development of mnemonics for interagency fire units and combined forest units.

??	Display of Unit position, which defines the level of the individual in the organization, when matched with IFPM standards relates to minimum ICS qualifications for incident operations.

??	Specific identification numbering system that is standard through out the region and is designed to reflect local geographic home unit/sub-unit.  Allows flexibility to exclude position identifier for units with shared fleet.

??	Uniform and consistent presentation and identification of FS/BLM vehicles, positions and call signs, reducing confusion of cooperators and local fire service agencies, when resources are mobilized to other units, areas, or incidents.

??	Procedures to incorporate fire emergency vehicle standards in agency directives.

The sampling of identification/numbering systems currently in use in the Pacific Northwest were designed to provide Agency/Unit identification, sub-unit identification, position or level within the unit, and a resource specific number identifier.  The recommended emergency fire vehicle marking standards provides the same levels of identification in a consistent format throughout the PNW.

Fire emergency vehicle marking standards have been approved for the Pacific Northwest Region.  The standards provide for safety, consistent appearance and application, as well as adherence to agency policy and direction for fleet vehicle marking.

Implementation of the Fire Emergency Vehicle Marking Standards is to begin immediately.

Fire emergency vehicle marking standards include:

?	An approved Forest Fire Emergency Vehicle Operating Plan and Job Hazard Analysis must be in place.
?	Each fleet vehicle designated as a fire emergency vehicle shall be approved by the Forest Supervisor and identified in the operating plan.
?	Approved fire emergency vehicles shall have the standard marking and emergency lighting package.  Striping or lights only are not acceptable.
?	The fire emergency vehicle marking package shall follow the standards for design, labeling and color as identified in the enclosed document.
?	All vehicles which are not approved as fire emergency vehicles shall have non-standard markings or equipment removed no later than next annual maintenance/safety inspection for the vehicle (within one year).
?	Approved fire emergency vehicles which currently have non-standard markings will, at a minimum, immediately correct the organization, unit and position identifiers.  Striping will be brought to standard as unit budgets allow or when the vehicle is replaced.

The Fire Emergency Vehicle Standards will provide an added measure of visibility to enhance safety in incident management, represent the Forest Service as a cohesive professional fire organization, and enhance daily operations and incident response through standard nomenclature and design.

Questions on implementation of the standards may be directed to Jeff Pendleton, Chair, Regional Fire Emergency Marking Committee, at (541) 575-3103, Carl Gossard, Assistant Director of Fire Operations at (503) 808-6461, Becky Hutchins, Regional Equipment Manager at (503) 808-2393, or Shonni Hanks, R6 Fleet and Equipment Specialist at (503) 808-2892.

<DESC>Are you looking for an installed onsite system, or an off site subscription service? If an off-site service - for what time frame?  OnSite Preferred  which includes required hardware.  The government prefers to manage everything. What types of devices do you want to be able to contact (i.e. phone, cell, fax, email, blackberries, alpha or numeric pagers, other)?  All of them.  The government  would need to know what your limitations are (5 devices? 10 Devices? Text only?).   We pref er to have text to voice automated conversion. Text to voice defined is if the program requires an administrator to type in the message, it then broadcasts it to the profiles (in the device order listed).  If and when it transfers from email to cell phone  or home phone, the program needs to be able to convert it to voice and complete the broadcast.  This way the administrator does not have to prepare both methods of transmission.    For your largest anticipated call out - how many people will need to be contacted, in what time frame and by what type of devices?  At least 65 people and up to 1000 people.  If the system has the ability to send out blocks, that is fine.  We are not looki ng for a 60 second mass notification, but we dont want it to take 24 hours either.   Are you looking for the vendor to supply the servers - Or will you provide them?  Yes it must be 19 inch rack mountable with hardware.  If the program requires little disk space and CPU, then a server is not needed. What type of backup system do you currently employ at the base? Veritas software (weekly full, otherwise incremental).  Our network is windows based running on ethernet. Concerning Support and Maintenance - Are you looking for 8/5 business day or 24/7?  Must have after-hours support and 24 hour receipt on parts/software to fix the system. Can you give us more details on the type of Firewall protocols you currently employ?  No.  If your program requires certain protocols to pass thru (in/out) then we need to know what they are. Some of the ones we looked at are standard HTTP.   If the progra m requires unique firewall protocols, please indicate on your proposal. Higher Headquarters will give the New Hampshire Air National Guard approval to open the firewalls, we will consider this in evaluation.  We are looking for a user friendly mass emergency notification system that will contact pagers, emails, blackberry, home phones, etc.  This requires text to voice automatic conversion software, i.e., allowing remote activation of a mass notification (a sys tem that the wing commander can start from home). We require a simple interface allowing the base personnel to update their own information if a phone number or email address changes. If you would like to submit an alternative solution, please submit at the same time, but separate from the original proposal.

I.Background

FDA?s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) regulates medical devices and radiation-emitting products.  It is expensive and time-consuming for the medical device industry to comply with FDA?s laws and regulations.  And it takes a great deal of FDA time and resources to guide industry through these processes.  

The CDRH website (www.fda.gov/cdrh) contains all of the documents we have available to help industry bring new products to market and ensure postmarket safety.  But it is sometimes difficult for users to navigate through the website in order to find the specific documents they need.

The purpose of this contract is to assess the CDRH website from the perspective of regulated industry in order to help set the requirements for designing a user-friendly site. Redesigning the CDRH website will save time and money by making it easier for companies to find, understand and comply with applicable laws and regulations.

However, if you would like to demonstrate your ability to conduct usability testing by submitting test scripts, reports, or company protocols, we would be happy to review them.  Your technical proposal should not exceed 10 pages, and you may submit your cost proposal as a separate document.

Q. Can you provide a ceiling price or ballpark price range that has been budgeted for this project? 
A.  We are not able to provide that information, please submit a brief description on your pricing for the necessary personnel, materials, services in support of this project.

STATEMENT OF WORK

AS OF August 9, 2006


1.0 BACKGROUND:  The mission of the Defense Finance & Accounting Services Rome is to produce timely and accurate disbursements to the Department of Defense personnel, their dependants and commercial concerns. Automation support varies with in each directorate at all DFAS sites, but every function depends heavily upon telecommunications services to respond to customer needs.  DFAS needs to provide better customer service while reducing costs by upgrading the Nortel 61C Public Branch Exchange (PBX) at Rome.  Currently telephony support is provided by the Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site (AFRL). The Rome Labs Director has determined that they no longer desire to support DFAS Rome.  This means that DFAS Rome requires its own PBX for telephony support. 
 
2.0 SCOPE:  The Nortel PBX at DFAS Rome requires an upgrade in order to meet Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) requirements.  DFAS Rome currently has a population of 564 personnel.  Rome?s population will increase by 436 more personnel due to BRAC realignment.  The Nortel 61C PBX is currently not a fully functional PBX. The current DFAS PBX is a fiber remote off of the AFRL PBX.  The Nortel 61C PBX was shipped from San Bernardino to DAFS Rome.  The contractor will provide equipment, software, and such technical support and training needed to install and implement the upgrade of the DFAS San Bernardino Nortel PBX to version 4.5 with Call Pilot, Symposium Express, DSN, and IP trunking.  The contractor will upgrade the frame relay room to required specifications needed to support the total population of DFAS Rome.  The battery backup and rectifier will need to be replaced.

<DESC>AN AMENDMENT TO THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN ISSUED.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE RESPONSE DATE IS NOW 9/6/06.



This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-06-950, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334517 and the business size standard is 500 Employees.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), has a requirement to purchase a current state-of-the-art technology small-angle X-ray scattering instrument.  This instrument will function as an intra-institute resource shared by the Sections on Biophysical NMR Spectroscopy, and the Section on Protein NMR, LCP/NIDDK.  Small-and wide angle scattering is capable of providing structural information at physiological-like (solution) conditions for biomolecules varying in size from several kDa to several thousand kDa.  Sample preparation for scattering studies is relatively straightforward, data acquisition is fast, and the information content within a fixed resolution range increases with the size of the system.  Thus, X-ray solution scattering is in a unique position of being both compatible and complementary with respect to high-resolution solution-state NMR.  A joint application of NMR and small-angle solution scattering is well suited to study, simultaneously and under native conditions, macromolecular structure, dynamics, as well as interactions between the macromolecule and the surrounding solvent.  Particularly promising applications include large and multi-domain macromolecules, and assemblies of inherently flexible or disordered macromolecules.  The resolution range of the instrument will allow studying systems at length scales ranging from 1 to 100 nm.  Specific areas of application that will gain most from the availability of an in-house scattering instrument include:

A.	Large and multi-domain proteins and tight macromolecular complexes.  NMR-only studies of such systems are hampered by the decrease in spectral quality with larger size and by scarcity of experimental data defining relative position of the individual domains.  Scattering data provides long-range translational restraints that complement global orientational restraints from NMR such as RDCs.

B.	Large oligonucleotides.  The constraint that scattering data provides on the overall shape of the RNA constructs will be especially valuable as NMR distance restraints are limited to the intra- and inter-strand neighbors and RDCs are difficult to acquire.

C.	Micelle-solubilized membrane proteins.  Solution scattering data will provide information on the shape of both membrane-embedded protein and that of the micelle itself.



GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED TASKS TO BE PERFORMED

All specifications must be demonstrated and guaranteed on site (Building 6, under construction).  The offeror must be able to provide data that indicate that it reasonably can be expected that the proposed specifications can be met.

The system shall include a Cu K?? X-ray radiation generator with collimating and monochromating optics, and evacuated pre-sample flight path with the collimating optics for beam definition, an evacuated sample compartment, an evacuated post-sample flight path, and a 2-dimensional detector.

The instrument preferably shall come equipped with the X-ray generator capable of providing radiation at Cu K?? wavelength with the photon flux at the sample of at least 2.106 cps in the high-resolution mode and 2.107 cps in the high-flux mode (described below).  The long-term drift of the incident photon flux should not exceed 3% per week as measured in a series of three measurement separated by one week each.  The short-term r.m.s. fluctuation of the photon flux at the detector should not exceed 0.5% as measured in a series of nine consecutive measurements of 10 min each.  The X-ray generator preferably shall be equipped with a shutter that can be operated both manually and in the automated mode from the main console as a part of the experiment.  The generator preferably shall also be coupled to at least two metal attenuator plates (Al, Cu or Ni are acceptable) with the widths between 0.1 and 1.0 mm that could be independently inserted into the beam path.  Instrument optics should allow for suppression of the wavelengths outside of the Cu K?? band with the ratio of the transmitted K??/ K?? radiation intensities not exceeding 10-4. 





2.	Collimation system

Describe collimation system, and include whether the instrument meets or exceeds the following requirements:

The evacuated incident beam focusing system shall be capable of producing a point (pinhole)-shaped beam at the sample position with a dimension (FWHM) not exceeding 0.5 mm in a high resolution setup and 1.0 mm in the high-flux setup.  An acceptable configuration may include at least 3 pinholes between the sample and the source with the total sample-to-source distance of at least 1400 mm and beam divergence not exceeding 1 mRad.  The position of each pinhole should then be independently user-adjustable in two directions perpendicular to the beam path.  The vendor will preferably provide two sets of pinholes, one for the high-resolution mode, and the other for the high flux mode.  The ratio of the radiation fluxes as the sample in the two modes should be at least 4.0 or higher with the increase in qmin not exceeding 33% for the high-flux setup with respect to the high-resolution setup.

3.	Sample compartment

Describe sample compartment and temperature regulation system, and include whether the instrument meets or exceed the following requirements:

Evacuated sample compartment setup shall allow user to load and recover samples in a cylindrical capillary or a flat-window sample cell through a programmable flow-through syringe pump without breaking the system vacuum and without any other windows between the entry window after the beam conditioning optics and the detector window.  Sample holder shall allow console-controlled adjustments in at least 1 dimension perpendicular to the beam with a precision of 10 ??m or better.  Sample volume of 20 ??L or less is required for the measurement.  At least 2 of each capillary sample cells with the diameters of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm each that will be provided with the system.  At least 2 flat cells with a path length o 0.7-1.5 mm will also be included with the system.  Temperature control unit will allow a capability of maintaining sample cell temperature in the range between +5oC and +60oC with sample cell temperature variations not exceeding 0.2oC once the set temperature is reached.  Variation of the cell temperature shall not exceed 0.02oC with a 1oC change of the room temperature.  Temperature adjustments of 10oC within this range should be obtained in 15 minutes or less.  The vendor shall provide a mounted standard (such as silver behenate) for conversion between detector pixel coordinates and the q axis and determination of the incident beam center within the detector plane.  The instrument shall include a mounted standard for absolute calibration of the scattering intensity such as glassy carbon.






4.	Sample-to-Detector Coupling

Describe sample-to-detector coupling, and include whether the instrument meets or exceeds the following requirements:

The instrument shall allow acquisition of the scattering data in the scattering vector range between qmin = 0.007 A-1 or smaller and qmax = 0.800 A-1 or larger, free of full or partial masking by any instrument components.  Here q=4*??*sin(????)/??, where 2?? is the scattering angle and ?? is the incident radiation wavelength.  Such range may be achieved by a user-variable setting for the sample-to-detector distance with the center of the detector offset by no more than 5 mm from the incident beam at each of these settings.  Such variable sample-to-detector distance will necessitate a multi-section evacuated flight path between the sample compartment and the detector that will not introduce any detector masking within the q range listed above.  The individual sections of such path shall be supported by movable independent metal supports rigidly fixable on the mounting table.

5.	Detector

Describe detector, and include whether the instrument meets or exceeds the following requirements:

The output of the detector should be convertible to the ACSII format with the raw number of counts at each detection element. The instrument will include a device for measurement, monitoring, and integration of beam intensity at zero scattering angle transmitted through the sample compartment independent of the data acquisition.  Acceptable devices include a semi-transparent attenuating beam stop with transmitted intensity measured by the main 2D detector, or a separate beam stop-mounted sensor.

Question: This solicitation contains a requirement for 6 internal hard drives.  Would it be acceptable to quote a server and separate array to accomodate that number of drives, considering that we would maintain the 2U size requirement? (server 1U and array 1U).  Answer: Yes, please provide your server specifications with your quotation.  Question: CLIN 0005 Qty 16:  10 ft KVM cables.  Do those need to be USB or PS/2 ends?  Answer: The 10ft KVM cables are required to connect to the 3 KVM 16 port switches that the vendor is also bidding on in this requirement.  The vendor will need to identify what kind of connection that the switches that they are offering require ? USB or PS/2 ends.  In the specs for the server, we have listed one USB or PCMCIA slot.  If the vendor is offering the above equipment with USB connections, they must keep in mind that this slot is in addition to any USB slots that will be needed by the KVM switches.

<CONTACT>LaTanya Johnson, 703-428-6318
<DESC>Questions concerning solicitation # W912HQ-06-T-0020 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Applications Analyst And Database Support General Non-technical Questions 1. Is this position for a single analyst to join an already existing team who will address the tasks or for a team of analysts who will address all the tasks listed between their members? There is not an existing team. There is a government POC. It is the contractors decision on how many people he assigns to the project.  2. Is the end of project based on 365 days or project completion? Both. Some of the tasks will have short duration and others will continue through the contracting period.  3. Are all listed tasks to be performed  is this a sampling of tasks  can other tasks be added by the COTR  can tasks be added by the contractor? All listed tasks are to be performed. If necessary, a modification to the contract will be done to add addi tional tasks. They would be negotiated. Tasks cannot be added by the contractor. 4. Is time to be explicitly divided according to percentages given? The percentages related to payment not time. 5. What are the specific clearance/security/access approvals and/or issues that need to be addressed? See MOD 1 of Solicitation W912HQ-06-T-0020. 6. Are face-to-face meetings required? Yes, at least quarterly to start. More if the government deems necessary. 7. Does the person(s) assigned to this task need to be assigned full-time to this task? That is the contractors decision. 8. Is payment (invoicing) only based on task completion or can invoicing be for hours expended? Invoicing is by task. 9. Since the Government expressed a desire for a Firm Fixed Price contract, if analyst(s) with the appropriate talents are offered for 1,920 hours (each) at a fixed price is offered, would this fulfill the requirements? The contractor bids what he feels is  appropriate to meet the scope of work outlined in the RFP. General Technical Questions: 1. Where does the COBOL program currently reside (how many systems, types of systems) and are there system design specifications for these systems? The COBOL programs are no longer functioning and only paper copies remain. 2. If there are design specifications, can they be provided?  An Oracle Designer Repository of the table structures, triggers, constraints etc. exists and an export could be provided upon request; this can only be imported into an existing copy of Designer .  3. What, if any, and how many new reports are required due to the COBOL conversion? No more than a dozen reports would be required. Visuals of the old reports can be provided. 4. How many total reports/forms/screens need to be converted and in what format/system do they currently reside? Potential reports are named in the RFP. They would be probably be written in PL/SQL or HTMLDB rather than converted. There are no forms. Existi ng screens in Oracle 9i would be modified. Task-specific Technical Questions: Task a: 1. Please describe the environment to be supported including the amount of equipment to be support, size of the databases and specific operating systems on each piece of equipment. Hardware and software are listed in the RFP and maintained at the Corps pr ocessing centers.  Task b: 1. How many applications / screens currently comprise DIS?  Approximately 67.  2. Do all DIS applications / screens need to be enhanced and converted to Oracle 10g?  Not all screens need to be enhanced however they may need modifications due to the 9i to 10g upgrade. 3. How many applications / screens currently comprise LPMS? Approximately 150. 4. Do all LPMS applications / screens need to be enhanced and converted to Oracle 10g? Not all screens need to be enhanced however they may need modifications due to the 9i to 10g upgrade. 5. What and how many applications currently have API generated code? Two applications; the LPMS application has approximately 75 API packages and the DIS application has approx imately 35 packages/programs. 6. How many applications are there currently? The two that are listed in the RFP. Task f: 1.	Please clarify/expand on this task. LPMS has two data entry systems, OMNI is one of them. OMNI loads data into the LPMS Data Warehouse monthly. This data is then summarized into tables. Currently this process is being beta tested and this task is requir ed to deal with any changes to it.  Task h: 1.	The word Complete drives a conclusion that these reports have been at least started.  Is that a fair assumption or do these reports need to be created and completed? These reports currently exist but do not have the code in them to allow for selection c riteria outlined in the task and data display that accompanies the selected critieria. 2.	Please clarify when required.  Is this an open-ended task to be completed when and if requested?  If so, how can we account for the hours associated with this task? When required refers to the users selection once all these criteria are in place. No add itional hours are needed. Task i: 1.	Are these the only reports from LPMS to be converted? Conversion is a loose term since the originals were COBOL programs against flat files and the reports need to be written against an Oracle database. Visuals can be provided. 2.	Clarify the reference to para F. This is a typo and should be para H. Task j: 1.	Please provide specifics and/or specifications for these reports. Visuals can be provided for some reports. Task n: 1.	Please provide clarification/specifics on this task. Specifics will be dependent on data center security requirements which have not been clarified at this time.  Task q: 1.	Who and/or how are these conference calls received (help desk, contractor, etc.)? Calls are direct between the COTR and the contractor with a functional person occasionally sitting in. 2.	Is call data captured/documented and reviewed before being passed to the contractor? No. Only actions that require the support of the Corps processing center are captured. These calls are placed by the COTR.  If so, what is the process? 3.	Making corrections as required is open-ended.  There is no way to quantify the workload that may be associated with any problem and/or enhancement that may be required.  As is always the case in system development, there will be tweaks, enhancements, co rrections, or changes.  Due to this process, will there be a review board to accept or reject a correction and prioritize any requests? Yes. 4.	Will any content/configuration management system be used to control product quality?  If so, will you provide this functionality or is this something we need to provide? Quality Assurance is done by functional office. 5.	Are there metrics that will be applied to turnaround time for corrections? Yes. 6.	Is 5% a cap for this area of effort? Yes. Task r: 1. Does this functionality exist in any of your current systems or would this be developed from scratch? Currently exists. Acceptance Criteria: 1. Please provide the specific acceptance criteria for each task, since invoicing is based upon acceptance. All tasks are accepted when they function as required.  2. Is this to be done at the end of the period of performance, or as the individual tasks are completed? As the individual tasks are completed.  3. If it is for the individual tasks, who determines the make up of the these tasks? Functional group. 4. Please describe the review process and specific timeframes. Product is tested and feedback is promptly written and provided to the contractor. Progress Reporting: 1.	How is the one business day period determined?  When a problem is presented TO us 	or when WE find a problem? Either. 2.	Will a POA&M be required for this? No. 3.	Will number of hours expended monthly be pulled from the invoice we send to them, or is a separate report required? Invoicing is based on completed tasks; hours is informational only. 4.	Is a separate task progress  report required or can all reporting be combined into one product? Single product. Place Of Delivery: 2. Does production work must be done in this environment refer to the delivery and installation of 	new applications to the production environment?  Yes. 3. Are there specific procedures for doing this?  Connection procedures are in the RFP and the rest refers to the Oracle environment.  4. Can releases be done during working hours?  If so, we would need to establish the working times 	for the production sites.  If not, is there already scheduled downtime for maintenance when these releases can be implemented? Already scheduled downtime on  Friday nights. 5. Would the contractor be responsible for installing new applications in the production environment? Yes. 6. Do recovery plans exist for applications that are moved to production and found to be in error (problems exist with the application)? New products/modifications are tested in a duplicate environment and should not malfunction in production. However, the  contractor should be able to rollback if a malfunction occurs. 7. When stating development and test environments are maintained by the contractor, please define maintain?  Since GFE does not apply, can we assume the government provides all development and test equipment? Not at this time. Government Furnished Equipment: 1.	No download of Oracle 9i is available from Oracle.  Assuming your current environment will need to be duplicated during this effort, will we have access to it or will we need to recreate your current environment for development and testing?  Oracle 9i i s available from the Oracle site under archived downloads.  2.	Along the same lines, in order to duplicate the production environment, hardware will be 	required.  Do we need to provide this or will this be GFE? No hardware or software will be provided. 3.	Oracle tools are available for free download from their website; however, they have to be paid for at the time of deployment.  The cost is based on the number of deployed user 	seats.  Will the Army pay for this or must we account for this?  If we are t o account for 	this, we need to know the number of user seats for deployment purposes. The Corps has a contract with Oracle to cover production systems. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SUBMISSION DATE HAS BEED EXTENED TO 05-SEP-2006. All other terms remain the same.
