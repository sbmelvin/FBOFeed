JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
RFQ:  FA4809-07-Q-0089
FOR A-DEC DENTAL CHAIR SYSTEMS

I.	CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION:  The contracting organization responsible for this action is the 4th Contracting Squadron, 1695 Wright Brothers Avenue, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC 27531.

II.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  The action required is a Brand Name Firm-Fixed Price Contract for the purchase of four (4) A-DEC Dental Chair Systems.  

III.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The requirement consists of furnishing four (4) A-DEC Delivery Dental Systems.  Each delivery system consists of Radius 1040 Internal-umbilical Chair with seamless upholstery, air/water quick disconnect in chair lift assy., Radius 2122 Traditional Delivery System, Position #1 - Autoclavable syringe 23.1150F00, Position #2 - 4-hole tubing 98.0879F00, Position #3 - Fiber optic with bulb tubing 98.0262F00, Position #4 - No tubing, intra-oral light source, dual voltage for 2 handpieces 90.0382F00, Chair touch pad, programmable 39.1045F00, Wet/Dry foot control with chip blower button, 300-watt power supply 28.1435F00,  Cascade contoured floor box frame and cover 41.1457F01, Radius 7155 Assistant?s Instrumentation w/3 position holder 75.1417F00, and 6300 radius Light 28.1303.00.  

IV.	AUTHORITY:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) & 6.302-1(c). 

V.	APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  Request to compete this Brand Name requirement. The 4th MDG is phasing out old dental systems currently in place.  This Brand Name Requirement is necessary to maintain standardization of existing equipment already in place.  A-DEC is the only known dental equipment configuration which will fit in the constructed chair site and is recommended by 4 ADOS/SGGD.      Additionally, 4 ADOS/SGGD has purchased only ADEC Systems since January 2006; the unit has already spent $67,000 in A-DEC Dental Chair Systems.  Biomedical Repair personnel are currently trained on A-DEC dental chair systems and the 4th MDG will not require additional training in the amount of approximately $10,000.00 for 120 training hours.  The Aeromedical Dental facility has been constructed to utilize smaller size dental chair systems and a drastic remodel would be required to accommodate to other dental chair systems.  Additionally, facility modifications would need to be accomplished to accommodate a different brand dental chair system.  Award of any brand name other than A-DEC Inc. will not be cost effective and would result in substantial duplication of costs since personnel are currently trained on A-DEC dental chair systems.  The duplication of costs is not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.

VI.	EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  A notice of the Government?s intent to award a Brand Name contract will be publicized via the Federal Business Opportunities Website as required by FAR 5.2.  

VII.	FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  The anticipated cost has been determined fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii) & (vi).

<SOLNBR>FA8617-08-R-6170
<RESPDATE>062207
<ARCHDATE>09302008
<CONTACT>Karen Shelley, (937) 904-4217
<DESC>TITLE:  T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program CLS Sustainment Description:  1.  337th Aeronautical System Group (337 AESG), 663d  Aeronautical Systems Squadron (663 AESS) is contemplating a competitively  awarded contract for sustainment of the T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program  (AUP).  This Request for Information is intended to provide the Air Force  with an understanding of the interest within industry, the technology, and  resources available to support competitive acquisition of a contract to  cover contractor logistics support (CLS) sustainment of the avionics  suites of 450 AETC, 3 AFMC and 10 Navy T-38C AUP aircraft.  The T-38C AUP  avionics suite consists of approximately 60 non-developmental (NDI) and  commercial Line Replaceable Units (LRUs).  The CLS contract will be a  firm-fixed price, performance based service contract for the logistics  support and sustainment of the T-38C AUP consisting of a base year (FY09)  and with four additional years of FFP options.  The contract will provide  for: a)	Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) operations at  each of AETCs T-38 main operating bases (MOBs) (Randolph AFB, Columbus  AFB, Vance AFB, Laughlin AFB and Sheppard AFB and supporting operations  for Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS); b)	A CLS program to repair removed components at the contractors (or  Original Equipment Manufacturers) facilities and return to COMBS, based  upon a fixed price for each of the annual number of hours flown by AETC,  AFMC and the Navy Test Pilot School (approximately 110,000 hours total  annually); c)	Over and Above (O & A) activities necessary for correction of problems  found during maintenance; d)	Materials for the O & A corrections; e)	Technical data and technical manuals, recommendations to responsible  engineering organization; f)	Field Service Representatives at each of the AETC Main Operating Bases,  Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS; g)	An effective Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages  Management (DMSMS) program; h)	A system that collects, manages and archives Maintenance Fault Lists  (MFL)/Pilot Fault Lists (PFL)/engine,  flight loads and ACMI data for each  flight, including mission planning and debrief data, that enables analysis  and could lead to product improvement; i)	A damaged equipment program; j)	In coordination with organization having systems engineering  responsibility resolve any issues involving software support, engineering  services and material deficiency reporting; k)	and the program management necessary to support these activities. Primary CLS tasks include repair of removed failed AUP components,  providing spares during repair process, performing Field Service  Representative tasks, and operation of a Contractor Operated Maintenance  Base Supply (COMBS) at each AETC MOB.  The period of performance for this  contract is planned FY09 through FY13. 2.  The T-38C CLS Sustainment approach will include performance based  logistics metrics for Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) at the avionics  level, and at the LRU level (system level avionics MTBF of 60 hours).  Guaranteed part turn-around times and issue rates at the COMBS are  planned.  In order to comply with the COMBS turn around times, the  contractor must assure that sufficient spares are available or other  arrangements are in place to assure that these times are met. Other  metrics and your suggestions for metrics will be considered.    A  technical data package (most current configuration) will be available in  Aug/Sep 2007.  The contractor must comply with the International Traffic  in Arms Regulations (ITAR) as required to support repairs if by foreign  Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). 3.  A companion program will be managed by ASC for software and  (potentially) hardware block upgrades to the T-38C avionics suite that are  necessary to assure that the T-38C AUP continues to provide AETC with  current up-to-date training capability.  Engineering and configuration  authority thus will rest with this ASC program.  The sustainment  contractor may need to establish associate contractor agreements with the  contractor performing the block upgrades.  The sustainment contractor  should plan for a low level of engineering change proposal activity  arising from the block upgrades, DMSMS, etc. 4. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an  offer and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.

This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2).  The complete draft BAA is listed at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm 
All associated documentation will also be posted at the above website.

1.0 Introduction:  The NAVAIR Program Executive Office for Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation (PEO(W)) is soliciting proposals for Naval Strike Weapons Affordability Initiative.  The objective of the affordability initiatives shall be to obtain transformational cost reduction advancements to existing and/or future sea-based Naval land attack strike weapons, and which can be demonstrated during the contract performance period. 

1.1 PEO(W) will consider a range of proposals that address subsystems, components, software and architectures, which directly support existing and/or future sea-based Naval land attack strike weapons, but are limited to: airframes and airframe subsystems; aeronautical design and control subsystems (including actuators, lift, and control surfaces); navigation guidance and control subsystems (including Global Positioning System (GPS) and GPS denied navigation); electrical power and regulation subsystems (including batteries); certification; command, control and, communication subsystems (including over the horizon and datalink systems); targeting subsystems, sensors and seekers (including multi-mode and semi-active laser seekers ); radomes; energetics subsystems (including warheads, multi-effects warheads, fuzes, and safe-arm devices);  propulsion (including air breathing engines, inlets, boosters, rockets, thrust-vector control systems, igniters, safe and arm systems); launch systems (including canisters, safe separation systems, bomb racks, and launch rails); fuel and fuel subsystems; Universal Armament Interface (UAI) implementation (platform/weapon); subsystems for a ?universal? precision guided munitions (PGM)launcher; and integrated logistics systems, processes, and components (including ?operator? and ?Depot? maintenance systems/processes, training, canisters, shipping containers, and other support equipment). 

1.2 PEO(W) will not consider proposals that support or are directed at torpedoes and torpedo systems, Navy Sea-Shield Weapons and supporting systems, ground weapons, Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD) and TBMD supporting systems, satellite systems and their supporting systems, intercontinental and strategic systems and their supporting systems, and anything else not specifically listed in 1.1 above.

2.0 Program Goals: The Government plans to award approximately $15M in FY06 funding and $13.5M in FY07 funding.  FY08 funds will be based on availability of funds.  Multiple awards are anticipated from the FY06 funds. For Government programmatic flexibility, offeror(s) should segment their cost proposals into an initial 9-month (or shorter) phase, which explores and validates the technical feasibility and tactical utility of the concept, a second phase proposed as an optional effort leading toward demonstration of the proposal concept, and a potential option third phase leading to a demonstration/prototype engineering effort. The total effort including options should not exceed three years. Successful initial phases will have a greater likelihood of receiving funding for subsequent optional phases.  
	
2.1 Phase I-Development Approach, Report Plan:  This phase explores and validates the technical feasibility and tactical utility of the concept by providing a plan to successfully achieve phase II & III.  The anticipated period of performance is for up to nine (9) months beginning approximately 1 September 2007.  The contractor shall plan on one program review during this Phase.  At the completion of this Phase the contractor shall update the ROI analysis provided in the original BAA proposal.  An objective of this phase would be to reach Technical Readiness Level (TRL)3.  TRL 3 is analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof-of-concept with limited functionality implementations and experiments with small representative data sets.  Scientific feasibility is fully demonstrated.  CDRL(s):  A001, A002, A003, and A004
      
2.2 Potential Phase II (Option)-Transformation:  This phase leads towards the demonstration of the proposed concept.  Efforts under the second phase of this program must be identified as options.  The option may be exercised approximately two (2) months after completion of the previous phase.  The contractor shall plan on two program reviews during this Phase.  At the completion of this Phase the contractor shall update the ROI analysis provided in Phase I.  Contractors shall reach the TRL 4 threshold with an objective of reaching TRL 6.  TRL 4 is module and/or subsystem validation in laboratory environment, stand alone prototype implementations and experiments with full scale problems or data sets.  TRL 6 is system/subsystem prototype demonstration in a relevant end-to-end environment.  Prototype implementations on full scale realistic problems.  Partially integrated with existing hardware/software systems.  Limited documentation available.  Engineering feasibility is fully demonstrated.  CDRL(s):  A001, A002, A003, and A004  

2.3 Potential Phase III (Option)-Initial Integration:  This phase leads to the initial integration efforts on the specific platform or other applied engineering phase.  If proposed and incorporated in the base as a priced option, the option may be exercised approximately two (2) months after completion of the previous phase.  The contractor shall plan on two program reviews during this Phase.  At the completion of this Phase the contractor shall update the ROI analysis provided in Phase II.  Contractors shall reach the TRL 6 threshold with an objective of reaching TRL 7.  TRL 6 is system/subsystem prototype demonstration in a relevant end-to-end environment.  Prototype implementations on full scale realistic problems.  Partially integrated with existing hardware/software systems.  Limited documentation available.  Engineering feasibility is fully demonstrated.  TRL 7 is system prototype demonstration in high-fidelity environment (parallel or shadow mode operation. CDRL(s):  A001, A002, A003, and A004 

3.0 Contracts:  Teaming is encouraged provided it does not result in any anti-competitive teaming arrangements. An offeror may submit more than one proposal. Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for Small Business. Pursuant to the requirements of FAR 19.702(a)(1), if proposal total exceeds $550,000, large businesses will be required to include a Small Business Subcontracting Plan with their proposal package.  Proposals from US government entities, federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), and other offerors who are proposing additional work under existing task order contracts will not be considered under this BAA.

3.1 Number of Awards:  NAVAIR anticipates conducting a single round of proposal receipt, evaluation, selection, and award. Upon completion of the evaluation of all offers, the offerors will be notified that (1) the proposal has been selected for funding pending contract negotiations, or (2) the proposal has not been selected. One copy of each non-selected proposal will be retained for the files. Any additional copies of non-selected proposals will be destroyed upon non-selection.  Awards under this BAA will be made to offerors on the basis of the evaluation criteria below, providing the best value to the Government.  Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. Awards, including options, will be accomplished on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) basis. Phases after Phase I will be FFP options, with pricing based on the cost proposal. A price for options beyond Phase I must be included or the options will not be considered. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.

3.2 Deliverables:  See Contract Data Requirement Lists (CDRLs):  A001, A002, A003, & A004

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the acquisition of MEO Subcontracting Support for Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC).  In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 (revised), Performance of Commercial Activities, a public-private competition for Non-Guard Security services has been announced.  In order for the Agency Tender Official (ATO) to effectively compete with private industry and in light of the fact that the military billets under study will be reprogrammed to other functions and not be available to be part of the MEO, it has been determined that it is in the government?s best interest to obtain an MEO Subcontractor to assist with creating the resulting agency tender.  If the government wins the A-76 competition, the MEO Subcontractor would then commence performance for those functions it proposed to perform in the initial agency tender offer. These services may include, but are not limited to, Armory and Ready-for-Issue (RFI) services, Court Services, Pass and ID Office (Visitor Control Center) Services, Physical Security Services, Supply/Logistics Services, Surveillance Detection Services, Training Services, Vehicle Inspection services and Working Dogs (Explosive Detection) services.  Services may be performed throughout CONUS, Hawaii and Guam.  It is intended to award a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite delivery, Indefinite Quantity type contract under which task orders shall be issued. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will consist of two phases.  Phase I tasking will consist of the MEO subcontractor working with the ATO to develop alternative solutions for the resultant agency tender offer.  If the government wins the A-76 competition, Phase 2 will consist of the MEO Subcontractor performing those Non-Guard security functions it proposed to perform in the initial agency tender offer.  It is anticipated that Phase 2 will consist of a phase-in period, a twelve month base period and four, one year option periods.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 561621.  This acquisition will be conducted as an unrestricted, full and open competition.  The RFP shall require the submission of a technical proposal as well as a price proposal.  RFP N00189-07-R-Z041 will be made available electronically, upon its release, at http://www.neco.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate for a multiple-year contract with Cornerstone Systems Northwest under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) Unique Capabilities based on Cornerstone?s unique modeling experience, as well as their capabilities in both knowledge management software, and simulation and mathematical modeling. To perform the requirements of this contract, the Contractor must be well versed in two disparate areas: (a) knowledge management software: demonstrated knowledge and experience to customize knowledge management tools for use in simulation and mathematical modeling to study the impact of cancer control interventions on population trends; and (b) simulation and mathematical modeling: demonstrated knowledge and experience to understand the CISNET models in enough depth to take information on particular aspects of the models and develop a coherent synthesis of model differences and similarities. Cornerstone Systems Northwest, Inc. has provided support, maintenance and enhancements of a centralized web-based collaborative application known as the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network (CISNET) Collaborative Knowledge Base under contract number N02-PC-44400. The proposed contract will permit Cornerstone to continue providing (1) Logistical, Technical and Basic Consortium Support; (2) Capabilities Enhancement; (3) Meeting Support and Participation; (4) Model Profile Maintenance and Development; (5) Model Interface Systems; (6) Model Synthesis Support; (7) Hardware and Software Support; and (8) Model Registration and Discovery System. Interruption of these activities while another contractor gains the knowledge required to provide these modeling services to the CISNET Collaborative Knowledge Base collaborators would lead to a paralysis of continuity and enhancements; meeting support and participation; and maintenance and development of the CISNET Collaborative Knowledge Base for its collaborators. Therefore, the Government has determined that Cornerstone Systems Northwest, Inc. is the only source to satisfy agency requirements to avoid these unacceptable delays. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement and must respond by submitting the information on/before the closing date noted in this announcement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate knowledge and experience in both Internet based collaborative knowledge databases and simulation modeling. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 22. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) order under BOA number N00019-05-G-0008 for services and engineering support necessary for the integration of the Tomahawk All Up Round (AUR) capability into the SSGN Class Nuclear Submarine.  This effort includes the systems engineering; system configuration drawing review; a detailed engineering review of the interfaces between the AUR and the SSGN/Multiple AUR Canister (MAC) Launcher and the SSGN Weapon Control System; review and comment on the preliminary change notices documentation; and associated program management supporting these efforts.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Company, P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, Raytheon has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk AUR.  Raytheon solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk AUR missile.  Raytheon currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk missile is required to perform the services and engineering support necessary for the integration of the Tomahawk AUR capability into the SSGN Class Nuclear Submarine, Raytheon is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

The courses are taught on a turnkey basis, with the contractor providing all instructors, course materials, equipment, and facilities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<DESC>Modification to replace "Sole Source" in place of "brand name or equal".  Tne Encoder must be the Enerdyne model listed below.  Sorry for any inconvenience.

The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB, CA has a requirement for 2 each SA 309913-01, ENC1000A94-00 Encoders (with Standard Features) to support the 419 FLTS to conduct flight testing.  This equipment must be completely compatible with the Enerdyne units that are already installed and in use in the bombers and other flight test aircraft at AFFTC.  This is a Brand Name or Equal acquisition. The following are the specifications:

?X	ADVS- Adaptive Digital Video Standard Compression Algorithm
?X	Real-Time Digital Compression of Full-Motion Video
?X	Small Size ?V 94 Cubic Inches
?X	Low Power ?V 8 Watts Typical at 28 VDC
?X	Three Selectable Video Inputs
?X	No Blurred Motion ?V Each Frame Separately Encoded
?X	User Programmable Video Parameters via EIA-232 Port
?X	Compsite NTSC Color and PAL, Y/C Capabilities
?X	Transmits at Rates Up to 10 Mbps Over Any Digital Medium

The ADVS Advanced Digital Video Standard compression technique causes no blurring of the compressed picture upon the encoding and decoding of any type of moving objects within a given picture.  A multiplexer provides inputs for asynchronous serial data, PCM data and clock, and an audio signal to be interspersed into the digitized video data stream.

The encoders will be used to compress the video signal received from the Merlin units in order to be able to record two hours using a HI-8mm tri-deck airborne video recorder.  Also, this signal may be transmitted to a ground station where the telemetry system will provide a real-time video picture of the pilot??s Head-Up-Display (HUD), the Multi-Function Display (MFD) and/or safety of flight test data during a mission.  Flight test engineers will be able to monitor aircraft performance in the control room as they observe an image of the pilot??s HUD and/or MFD.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for the Domino Version 7.0.2 Lotus Enterprise Integrator (LEI) Multi O/S Media Pack.  This software is required to load the software on two servers located in one of EPAs Offices.  LEI is the program used to transfer data between its Oracle and Lotus Notes databases and is necessitated by the security requirements of the Offices applications.  The Office is currently using an older LEI version which works with the Agencys current version of Lotus Notes, however, EPA will soon be upgrading its Lotus Notes application to Version 7 and therefore the Office needs to upgrade to LEI software Version 7.0.2., 1, EA;<BR>LI 002, License and Maintenance Agreements for 400 "Value Units."  The Environmental Protection Agency requires license and maintenance agreements for 400 Value Units.  Since the Office will be installing LEI on two (2) servers and each server has two (2) single-core processors, the Office needs to purchase 400 Value Units for the licenses and maintenance.  The Office has computed the number of Value Units as follows:   2 (servers) x 2 (processors/server) x 1 (core/processor) x 100 (value units/core) = 400 value units. , 1, EA; <BR><BR>For this solicitation, Environmental Protection Agency intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. Environmental Protection Agency is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids. All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com.

Final responses to this RFI will be due on 7 June 2007, 9:00 a.m. EST.  Responses will be reviewed and may result in further clarifications to further explore commercial capabilities with selected respondents.  As industry may expect to see portions of submitted information in future solicitations, portions of the response containing proprietary information should be clearly marked as such.  
ITEMS REQUIRED:  (59 each) VMWare licenses, (1 year) maintenance support for all 59 units, (1 each) P2V Assistant, Enterprise Edition P2V Assistant License, (30 each) Platinum SnS for VI1 Standard Licenses, (24 each) Platinum SnS Vmotion 2 processor Licenses.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice for a project to develop of a low density microarray chip used to detect the DNA and RNA of the Lyme disease spirochete in ticks.  This notice is for purposes of obtaining competition sources within the market.  This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited herein.  No solicitation exists; however, the Government?s anticipated requirements are provided below.  

*****************************************************************
Statement of Work Requirements/Information: 

I. BACKGROUND

The Lyme disease spirochete is transmitted by ticks in the genus Ixodes. Lyme disease is the most common vector borne disease in the United States, with >23,000 cases reported to CDC in 2002. On average, over 20,000 are reported to CDC each year. In order to identify regions where ticks carry the Lyme disease spirochete, rapid and effective tests are needed to screen ticks for spirochetal infection in order to alert the general public of the Lyme disease risk in their area of residence. Although a variety of tests are available to detect spirochetes in ticks, they suffer from high cost, false positive results, and false negative results. Microarray chip technology has been used with pathogens such as influenza virus to cheaply, rapidly, and efficiently detect the nucleic acids of this pathogen in clinical samples. Adaptations of this method for detecting spirochetes in ticks holds promise to assist public health workers combat the Lyme disease epidemic.

II. PURPOSE

The overall goal of the project is to develop a low density microarray chip that can be used to detect the DNA and RNA of the Lyme disease spirochete in ticks. The microarray chip should be both sensitive in detecting spirochetes that are actually present in these vector ticks, and specific in not producing false positive results by detecting other pathogens present in ticks. The microarray will be used in the field to detect spirochetes in field populations of ticks as well as ticks on individual patients. 

III. SCOPE OF WORK

The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials, and equipment necessary to design a low density microarray that can detect spirochetes in ticks. Based on the known nucleic acid sequence of the Lyme disease spirochete, vendor will design nucleic acid probes that bind sensitively and specifically to the Lyme disease spirochete.  Once the microarray is designed, the micoarray must be tested on known positive tick samples to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the test. The microarray will then be tested against field collected ticks to determine its efficiency. 


IV. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED

The vendor shall perform the following tasks in the order shown:

1.	Select candidate nucleic acid probes from the known genetic sequence of the Lyme disease spirochete to detect the DNA and RNA of this pathogen

2.	Test low density microarray against known positive samples of Lyme disease spirochete nucleic acid.

3.	Determine the sensitivity and specificity of the microarray chip against known positive nucleic acid samples. Achieve a sensitivity (positive tests/known positive samples) of >95%. Achieve a specificity (negative tests/known negative samples) of >98%.

4.	Determine the sensitivity and specificity of the microarray chip on ticks known to be positive for the Lyme disease spirochete and ticks known to be negative for the Lyme disease spirochete.

5.	Test the microarray chip on samples of field collected ticks from areas known to be hyperendemic for Lyme disease.

6.	File a report to CDC describing the development of the assay and then provide data on the test results against ticks. 


*****************************************************************
Potential offerors who believe they are capable of providing the services referenced herein, shall submit all responses to this notice to the point of contact listed below.  All responses shall be provided not later than 6/8/07 and shall be submitted via e-mail to: tdc0@cdc.gov.  No telephone call will be expected, all inquiries must be in writing and provided as stated above. ##

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for purchase of 60 each Limiter, Passive, P/O Receiver Protector, Advanced Control Components, Inc. P/N ACLM-4852C24; NSN:  5895-01-400-3043; ASN: R400-2A3A1. This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS) NEXRAD spare parts program, to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center located in Kansas City, MO.  The Advanced Control Components, P/N ACLM-4852C24, is an integral part of the receiver protector in the WSR-88D weather surveillance radar, commonly known as NEXRAD.  The unit is a RF High Power Non-reflective solid state switch that protects the receiver components from the effects of transmitter high power.  Specific required characteristics include frequency range, power dissipation, input pulse width, rise/fall time, isolation condition, flat leakage, spike leakage, passive insertion loss, recovery time, phase linearity, VSWR, coupling, calibration accuracy, and directivity. Extensive testing is required at various frequencies and temperatures to qualify a part for this application.  Without the limiter, the radar will not operate; NEXRAD is a joint program involving the Department of Commerce (NWS), Department of Defense, and the Department of Transportation (Federal Aviation Administration).  In order to gain the most benefit from the shared resources of the three agencies, and to ensure configuration management, like replenishment items must be used at all sites.  Such commonality reduces procurement, training, documentation, sparing, and repair costs for the following reasons:  1) The replenishment item is already stocked at the NLSC warehouse and fielded to the Tri-Agency members; 2) The equipment specified is being used at the NWS primary operational and technical support facility in Norman, Oklahoma. Its technical assistance hotline must be able to coach technicians through troubleshooting activities using a standard frame of reference; 3) The equipment specified is currently described in published NEXRAD maintenance procedures.  Alteration of these procedures to accommodate equipment substitutions would be costly and manpower intensive in that the manual would have to be rewritten with additional test procedures and redistributed to all sites (NWS, FAA, and DOD); and 4) The equipment specified is being used at the National Weather Service Training Center to train maintenance personnel.  Additional course material and classroom time would be necessary to train using other vendors? equipment. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to acquire from the original manufacturer Advanced Control Components, Inc.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time.  The government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to Advanced Control Components, Inc., whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the government without further notice. The anticipated award date shall be within 20 calendar days after the date of this publication. Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a detailed  statement regarding its capability to provide the specified part or an equivalent part that is comparable in every aspect including form, fit and function. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other government agency to which it has previously provided the item. The information should be submitted by email to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to telephone number 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian. Failure to provide the required information will deem your submission non-responsive. All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. The NAICS code for this requirement is 335999. All contractors doing business with the Central Region Acquisition Division (CRAD) must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) or certification with the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  This is a government initiative that was designed by the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) to replace the paper Representations and Certifications (Reps & Certs) process.

<SUBJECT>41 -- American Embassy Jakarta Standardization of Household Appliances
<DESC>The American Embassy at Jakarta intends to standardize on General Electric (GE) products for the household appliances installed at the residents of both government-owned and short-term lease houses and apartments.  This is in the best interests of the U.S. Government as there is a continuing need to either replace or repair broken or un-serviceable appliances.  It is more cost effective to maintain one brand of appliances (GE) for the following reasons:

A.  Standardizing reduces the warehouse inventory of spare parts and replacements.  This saves employee time, warehouse space, and reduces the total inventory of spare parts and replacements.

B.  Accounting for only one brand of spare parts reduces the administrative and inventory systems.  The reconciliation is easier, faster, and more efficient.

C.  Spare parts and replacement units of one brand reduces inventory compared to maintaining stocks of two or more appliance brands.

D.  Maintenance technicians are proficient with the maintenance and repair of one brand of appliance.  Thus, there is no need for extra personnel or contractors who are proficient in the maintenance and repair of other appliance brands.

E.  Standardization of appliances and repair parts reduces the total life-cycle cost of the appliance program.

This announcement is for informational purposes only; it is not a request for proposals or quotations. Interested firms may email capability statements to the point of contact identified below. Capability statements are due by June 12, 2007.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Ergonomic Hand Truck or Cart for Material Handling
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Ergonomic Hand Truck or Cart for Material Handling 


Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercialize patented technology for a Hand Truck (Cart, or other material handling device) which provides the ability to move heavy objects in an ergonomically correct posture. 

Background:  In the past, various types of hand-held material-moving devices have been developed for different applications.  These prior material-moving carrying devices have not been constructed ergonomically so as to reduce the risk of potential injury to the user.  The present invention provides a solution to the potential injury problems associated with material handling, by an ergonomically constructed material-handling device for moving heavy and/or large objects.  

Description:   This invention relates to the design of a Hand Truck or Cart which is designed to allow workers to move objects while maintaining an ergonomic posture of the back, shoulders, wrists and knees.  The design accomplishes this by using an adjustable handle height and an ergonomically correct handle.  The resulting device helps workers maintain a neutral posture while moving objects. This should reduce ergonomic-related injuries associated with material handling (which is the number one expense for workman?s compensation in industry).  

Potential 
Applications: The main application for this patented technology is in the design of Hand Trucks, Carts, and other associated types of material handling devices.  

Development Status:  LLNL has built and tested Hand Trucks which embody the patented design.  

IP Status:		Patent No. 6,779,803, ?Ergonomic Material Handling Device? 
Issued 8/24/0

Please visit the IPAC website at: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Material Handling Device should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

<SUBJECT>25 -- Lease a Bosch Urea Dosing System
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Vehicle and Fuels Emission Laboratory (NVFEL), Office of Transportation and Air Quality, Assessment and Standards Division, Ann Arbor, Michigan, seeks to enter into a lease agreement, on other than full and open competition,  with Robert Bosch Corporation, 2800 S 25th Ave, Broadview, IL 60155  to lease for a period of 6 months, with 2 three (3) month option periods,   a closed loop urea dosing, control, and measurement system to include engineering technical support.  The requirement will include setup, operation, and calibration of a closed-loop urea dosing control system.

The agency has a need to meet specific calibration conditions where the system must function in a closed-loop manner at a point wich simulates Notch 8 conditions on a locomotive engine.  The engine to be used for testing at the NVFEL contains a Bosch engine control unit (ECU), coordination of control between the proprietary software in the ECU and prototype software in the DCU can only be achieved using Bosch components and the associated ETAS equipment.  The purpose of the lease agreement is to allow for the agency to complete testing of a urea dosing system which can automatically and continually adjust the dosing rate based on feedback from a NOx sensor downstream of the SCR catalyst.  This testing will demonstrate that a closed-loop urea dosing & control strategy is able to maximize NOx conversion efficiency, while at the same time, minimizing ammonia slip.  The Robert Bosch Corporation is the only company currently considered to have the specific type of closed-loop dosing system to meet the requirements as set forth herein:

The Urea Dosing System must meet, as a minimum, the following Specifications:

1.  Urea tank with integral supply pump, urea dosing module (nozzle), hydraulic line from supply pump to dosing module, dosing control unit (DCU), electrical harness, exhaust pipe flange for mounting dosing module, exhaust mixing plate, and ASCET simulation model (for communication between engine control unit and DCU)
2.  ETAS calibration & measurement equipment; ES1000 chassis, 1120.3 system controller board, 1130.3 simulation board, 1222.3a CAN interface board, 1201 ETK interface board, 1303.1 A/D interface board, F-00K-102-557 ETK interface cable, F-00K-102-584 power cable, K106 CAN interface cable (2 ea), and analog input cables (2 ea).
3.  Technical support; ability to include set-up, operate, and calibrate the dosing control system, with an emphasis on calibrating the system to function in a closed-loop manner at a point which simulates Notch 8 conditions on a locomotive engine.
4.  Must be able to deliver the complete system within 2 weeks of contract award date.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. AG-51LA-S-07-AA04 is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16. The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516.  The USDA, ARS, MWA, NCAUR, Peoria, IL, has a requirement/need for a Moisture Sorption Analyzer. This instrument will be used to study the water adsorption and desorption properties of materials. The Moisture Sorption Analyzer must meet or exceed these minimum requirements.
THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS ARE:  (1)  The instrument shall include an autosampler which allows up to 10 samples to be loaded and evaluated unattended.  The autosampler tray shall be removable for easy loading and unloading of samples.  The instrument software shall include an auto-tare feature to tare each sample boat/pan unattended and store that information for later use.  The autosampler software shall allow a unique experiment to be performed on each sample within a loaded tray.  Calibration of the autosampler shall also be software driven and shall take less than 5 minutes to complete.

(2)  The autosampler shall also have an alternative configuration which allows up to 25 samples to be loaded and evaluated unattended.  That configuration should support the use of alternative pan types including platinum, sealable aluminum, and stainless steel mesh pans.  Sealable pans shall be available which isolate the sample from the ambient environment while awaiting analysis on the autosampler.  Those pans shall be automatically opened at the time of analysis in a fashion that ensures proper interaction with the atmosphere inside the humidity chamber.

(3)  The humidity chamber shall be capable of generating humidities over the range 0-98%RH at temperatures between 5?85 ?C.  The size and mass of the humidity chamber shall be capable of supporting several types of common sorption experiments ? stepped humidity experiments at constant temperature, ramped humidity (at rates up to 0.5% RH/minute) at constant temperature, and ramped temperature experiments (at rates up to 0.5 ? C  / minute) while maintaining constant %RH.  Isothermal temperature control of the humidity chamber shall be at least +/-0.1?C.

(4)  Humidity shall be generated by controlling the ratio of  0 % RH and 100 % RH purge gases using high precision, calibrated mass flow controllers.  The system shall have humidity sensors located near the sample and reference boats / pans which provide a continuous direct indication of the humidity achieved at those locations

(5)  The instrument shall contain built-in diagnostics for each key hardware component (i.e., the microbalance, the humidity chamber temperature system, and the humidity generation system), which provide continuous monitoring of performance and automatic notification if any problems occur.  In addition, the instrument software shall contain a ?scheduling? feature, which automatically provides a more complete check of instrument performance indicators at operator-selected time intervals.

(6)  The instrument shall contain all components in a single cabinet.  In addition, the instrument shall be designed to minimize its ?footprint? on the laboratory bench (ideally, the instrument shall not occupy more than a 24 X 24 inch area), thereby conserving valuable lab space.

(7)  Installation and training to be included.

(8) Instruction manuals must be included.

    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>The purpose of this Solicitation Amendment is to answer a question.  The Solicitation closing date is not changed.

Question:  We would like to ask a question with respect to the subject RFP.  If we submit an offer and are selected to assist the Government, will this prohibit us from supporting PWS/solicitation development for A-76 competitions during the period of performance?

Answer:  No.  A contract award for consultant services resulting from this solicitation would not preclude Performance Work Statement (PWS) Team and Contracting Officer assistance under a separate, concomitant Competitive Sourcing Support contract.  However, Most Efficient Organization (MEO) Team assistance, following formal FedBizOpps announcement and during the Competitive Sourcing study/competition(s), would be prohibited under the provisions of FAR 9.5.

Please note that at the present we are not scheduled to do the procurements for the PWS development and MEO support.  In the event that those contracts are done by a different office, that office will have the final say on who is eligible to compete.

<DESC>This amendment is to provided further clarification. Clarification requested: We are in receipt of Amendment 03 to the above Solicitation and there appears to be further need for clarification with respect to the reference to ASNT compliance.  ASNT h as never issued a specification or requirement for any digital x-ray imaging software to be certified by or in compliance with ASNT. A search of ASNT's web site, www.asnt.org/search will show zero results for DICONDE or any reference to digital x-ray imagi ng software.  If your technical staff deems this to be correct then we ask the following question: Question: If the computed radiographic (CR) digital x-ray software provided states that it is an NDT Version and it certifies that the software is DICOM comp liant, is this software acceptable? Clarification provided: It will only be acceptable if documentation is provided stating that it is compliant with DICOM/DICONDE under ASNTs format specifications.  The NDT format is required.
