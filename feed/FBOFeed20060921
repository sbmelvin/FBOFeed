<DESC>The US Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, Office of Aviation (INL/A) intends to procure the Airborne Weapon Surveillance System (AWSS) from Radiance Technologies, Inc. on a sole source basis.  INL/A is authorized through Foreign Assistance Act to execute support to US missions around the world to counter illicit crop production, interdict the  production of illegal narcotics and interdict the transport of these illegal drugs.  To improve safety and survivability for our personnel, our aircrews need to be alerted instantly of weapons fires in order to avoid these deadly threats.  Justification for this critical need is derived from the persistent narco-terrorist attacks on INL/A operations in South America and high threat missions flown in support of eradication operations in Afghanistan.  These threats have increased and have resulted in loss of life and material damage due to small arms fires that have remain undetected by aircrews.  The justification is urgently needed protection and situational awareness enhancement inside aircraft cockpits to alert aircrews executing their counter-narco-terrorism missions in South America and Afghanistan.  The unusual and compelling urgency for this support will introduce a new fast-framing infrared commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) technology.  The Airborne Weapons Surveillance System (AWSS) will detect, identify, locate/target and disseminate muzzle flashes of enemy weapons that fire on INL/A aircraft. Therefore, adapting AWSS for INL/A operations will increase safety and survivability by enhancing the aircrews while executing INL directed missions. AWSS is a unique integration of COTS technology and special algorithms that will integrate into existing airframes to support immediate pilot notification of fires in the vicinity.  This will allow the pilot to maneuver to avoid additional fires and provide a warning to other flight members when working in formation or with other flight elements.  This effort allows for acquisition support of AWSS integration with INL/A existing aircraft fleets.

<DESC>The U.S. Government currently occupies 15,832 Rentable Square Feet of office and related space in a building under lease in San Francisco that expires on January 17, 2007.  The Government has a requirement for an additional 11,148 rentable square feet of contiguous space to be used as office and related area.  The total rentable space must be sufficient to yield at least 25,215 ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet.  Proposed space must be contiguous.  Vertical contiguous space will be considered, but proposed space must be able to accommodate all workstations and support areas on a single floor with only contract guard offices and long-term storage areas to be separately located on an adjoining floor.

Four (4) structured parking spaces for official Government vehicles are required.  Additional employee and visitor parking, per local building codes, can be provided within a one-block walking distance.  All parking must be provided at no added cost to the Government.

Proposed space must be located within 3 blocks of a BART station and in the area bounded as follows:  California on the North, 3rd/Kearny on the West, Harrison on the South, and Spear on the East.

Lease term will be ten years, five years firm.  Occupancy is desired by July 1, 2007.

The Government is considering whether to expand at its existing location or to relocate to alternative space which can satisfy the new larger space requirement.  In making its determination, the Government will consider the availability of alternate space that potentially can accommodate the contiguous requirement, as well as relocation costs likely to be incurred, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

To submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, Monday, October 9, 2006.  Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership.  Expressions of interest should include building (or site) name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, percentage of common area factor used to determine the rentable square feet, amount of available on-site parking, and contact information for owner or authorized agent.

Other factors impacting the Government's right under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.  Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, meet OSHA requirements, must be seismic compliant, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain.  Space must be ready for occupancy on or before September 1, 2007.

DELINEATED AREA:  Space must be situated within the San Diego Central Business District (CBD).  

LEASE TERM:  Lease term is five (5) years with a firm term of three (3) years, with termination rights at any time thereafter upon 60-day advance written notice.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST:  If you desire to submit a location for consideration, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, October 6, 2006.  Expressions of interest should include building name and address, legal description, 1/8 inch scale drawing of space offered, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), method of measurement used to determine rentable square feet (Common Area Factor), and contact information for owner or authorized agent.

The Government intends to make a direct award to Oxford Instruments.  Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.   No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement no later than 10:00am, MST, 25 Sep 2006, stating that comparable supplies and/or services are available and would be more advantageous to the Government.

10 MSG/LGCB has a requirement for an Electronic Backscatter Diffraction System with salient characteristics defined as follows:

Electron Backscatter Diffraction Unit:  needed to interface with an existing scanning electron microscope.  Currently in use is a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) made by JEOL (Model JSM 4680) and an elemental analysis tool made by Oxford Instruments which attaches to this SEM.  With the new EBSD mentioned above, the center will enhance the capability of the microscope to study microstructural details.  This new tool?s hardware and software are from the same manufacturer of the SEM and EDAX systems currently used in DFEM.  Both hardware and software are designed to integrate into these currently-operational systems.  No additional training will be required and no integration/data conversion issues will slow down the conduct of research.  Standardizing control configurations and system software minimizes test specimen loss.  Multiple configurations and differing software are expected to result in lost specimens and additional costs in specimen preparation. Part No: HKLEBSD Basic - HKL Basic System for Mapping, Texture and Phase ID.  Provides hardware and osftware for acquisition and indexing of Electron Backscatter Diffraction Patterns (EBSP) with SEM beam control.  H1-604 Forescatter Detector System with four diodes for Nordlys II (requires an available auxillary SEM input should SEM imaging be required.)

Section K–(ORCA) On Line Representations and Certifications - Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov . In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of  contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.   The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional readonly provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.Thank you, Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive,  Crystal Park 1, Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202 ,  Tel. 703-872-8600  Fax 703-872-8598,email integrated.acquisition@gsa.gov | http:egov.gsa.gov.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission architects and engineers to maintain and modernize our legacy federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Denver Federal Center (DFC)is a federal campus located in Lakewood, Colorado on 670 acres of land.  Originally, the site was developed for a small arms ammunition plant that was built in 1941 to support the World War II effort.  After the war, the site was adapted as a Federal complex for office, lab and warehouse use.  Currently, there is approximately 3.9 million RSF, 7,000 parking spaces and 90 buildings which houses approximately 30 agencies and bureaus.  The DFC is surrounded by 4 major thoroughfares providing easy and direct access from downtown Denver, Metro Denver, Colorado Springs and Golden for tenant agencies, customers and associates.  

The project involves the complete replacement of domestic and fire water lines, complete replacement of sanitary sewer, partial replacement of storm water lines, electrical, and telecommunications lines and will provide a reliable utility infrastructure that will allow GSA to continue providing service to tenant agencies for the next 50 years. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of an existing pump station and wet wall and the construction of a new pump station, wet well, and associated water system components, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English units. NEW WORK IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE DONE IN METRIC UNLESS THERE IS A CLEAR RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS.   THE RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS IS THAT THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTING OR BEING INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING ENGLISH UNIT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS 50 TO 60 YEARS OLD.

The proposed project includes:
•	Updating the sanitary sewer master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Developing a water system master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Replace existing pump station and wet well.
•	Installing two new alternate water supply connections and installing additional piping loop connections and isolation valves.
•	Combine fire protection water system supply piping with the domestic water piping to have a single supply system, per Denver Water’s design and construction requirements.  This also includes the installation of new hydrant assemblies.
•	Partial Replacement of sanitary sewer system collection lines and manhole rehabilitation.
•	Replace a portion of existing overhead communication lines with new underground lines.
•	Install approximately one mile of duct bank to replace overhead wire systems and connect dead-end electrical loops.
•	Replace electrical distribution switchgear components.
•	Experience working within contaminated environmental areas is required.

The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), sustainability goals, and customer agency requirements.  In addition, because this work is on a secured federal campus, security clearances are required prior to working on the site.

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  A LEAD ENGINEER DESIGNER IS REQUIRED.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Denver Federal Center is a federal campus located in Lakewood, Colorado on 670 acres of land.  Originally, the site was developed for a small arms ammunition plant that was built in 1941 to support the World War II effort.  After the war, the site was adapted as a Federal complex for office, lab and warehouse use.  Currently, there is approximately 3.9 million RSF, 7,000 parking spaces and 90 buildings which houses approximately 30 agencies and bureaus.  The DFC is surrounded by 4 major thoroughfares providing easy and direct access from downtown Denver, Metro Denver, Colorado Springs and Golden for tenant agencies, customers and associates.  The Federal Government is the second largest employer in the Lakewood community.  Community and visitor attractions include, National Archives, Child Care and Infant Toddler Center, Wellness Center, GSA Property Sales, Credit Unions, Training Centers, USGS Map Sales, Technology Information Center and BOR School Tours. 

The project involves the complete replacement of domestic and fire water lines, complete replacement of sanitary sewer, partial replacement of storm water lines, electrical, and telecommunications lines and will provide a reliable utility infrastructure that will allow GSA to continue providing service to tenant agencies for the next 50 years. 

SCOPE OF WORK
Selection of the CMc ? type firm will be in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations, source selection procedures and the ?Best Value Trade-Off? process. All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitation. As part of the CMc Pre-Construction Phase, the CMc shall work with the A E and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. For the Pre-Construction portion of this contract, GSA intends to have the contractor perform services such as: preliminary evaluation of design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, resolving problems, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews and performing administrative and other services as defined in this scope of work, in addition to other related services deemed necessary to provide for a completely functional multi-system utility infrastructure.  For the Construction Phase of this project, the major work items include the replacement of the existing utility infrastructure as defined within the contract documents. Construction will be phased and the Denver Federal Center will remain operational by all 30 federal agencies during construction process.  All campus systems will remain in operation during construction and the project phased to avoid disruption to occupants. The Total Estimated Construction Cost range is $30 million to $35 million.  The construction duration will be approximately 24 months. This amount or duration does not include Pre-Construction Phase services (Base Contract). CURRENTLY FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE BASE CONTRACT. 

Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor:  A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to an owner or client (in this case the GSA) to provide services such as design review, cost estimating, sustainability review, scheduling and general construction services.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor; the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.  The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to:  evaluating design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing and preparing cost estimates, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, conducting VE exercises, conducting constructability reviews, constructing the multi-system utility infrastructure, pump station, and water storage facility at or below the defined budget or Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional multi-system utility infrastructure.  At the time of the CMc contract award, which is projected to coincide with the Design Development Phase, project development shall occur in general conformance with the process described in the American Institute of Architects Document A121/CMc (also known as AGS Document 565) and ?Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Construction Manager Where The Construction Manager Is Also The Constructor?.

The proposed project includes:
?	Updating the sanitary sewer master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
?	Developing a water system master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
?	Replace existing pump station and wet well.
?	Installing two new alternate water supply connections and installing additional piping loop connections and isolation valves.
?	Combine fire protection water system supply piping with the domestic water piping to have a single supply system, per Denver Water?s design and construction requirements.  This also includes the installation of new hydrant assemblies.
?	Partial Replacement of sanitary sewer system collection lines and manhole rehabilitation.
?	Replace a portion of existing overhead communication lines with new underground lines.
?	Install approximately one mile of duct bank to replace overhead wire systems and connect dead-end electrical loops.
?	Replace electrical distribution switchgear components.
?	Experience working within contaminated environmental areas is required.

The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the GSA?s PBS P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), sustainability goals, and customer agency requirements.  In addition, because this work is on a secured federal campus, security clearances are required prior to working on the site.

Proposal Submission Requirements:  Proposals will be evaluated using the Source Selection Best Value Process.  Offerors must submit information addressing the technical evaluation factors identified below that will be evaluated by the Source Selection Board as well as pre-construction fees (base award) and a guaranteed maximum price for construction (option).

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for a software program for wheel configuration for off-road applications to support the next generation of lunar rovers. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the NWVPM software program from the Vehicle Systems Development Corporation to meet this requirement. The following criteria are critical aspects of the system: 1) The model must be suitable for the prediction of wheeled vehicle performance in soft soil. The performance metrics should include the vehicle thrust, rolling resistance, drawbar pull, tractive efficiency, and rut depth, all as a function of wheel slip. 2) The model must have been validated using experiments with a single wheel-soil dynamometer, as well as at least one full-scale wheeled vehicle. 3) The model must be capable of predicting the performance of both rigid and flexible wheels. 4) The model must predict the normal and shear stress distributions at the tire-terrain interface. 5) The model must parameterize the terrain using the so called “Bekker parameters”. These are the frictional modulus of deformation, the cohesive modulus of deformation, the exponent of deformation, the angle of internal friction, coefficient of cohesion, and coefficient of slip. 6) The model must take into account the position of each set of wheels along the vehicle body. 7) The model must take into account the vehicle load distribution and dynamic force exchange between wheels through the vehicle chassis and suspension. 8) The model must take into account the effect of multiple-wheels passing over the same terrain, referred to as the “multi-pass effect”. 9) The model must take into account the effect of shear resistance when calculating the sinkage of the tire into the soil. 10) The model must solve in less than ten seconds for all input parameter cases. 11) The model must operate on the Windows platform. 12) The mathematical framework behind the model must be revealed. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 noon local time on 09/27/06.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for testing and analysis of materials used in human-rated propulsion systems.  Marshall Space Flight Center requires testing of materials such as carbon phenolic and graphite phenolic materials and carbon/carbon, ceramic, insulation, ceramic matrix composite, and advanced and polymer composite materials supporting propulsion and space transportation applications.	The properties generated shall be measured under conditions designed to simulate the conditions in application including temperatures up to 5500 degrees F, oxidizing environments up to temperatures and in excess of 3000 degrees F, and cryogenic temperatures as low as -450 degrees F at a minimum.  The Contractor shall have the capability to prepare specimens, design unique test hardware and specimens, fabricate hardware test fixtures, ensure sufficient alignment for data accuracy, and generate test procedures to achieve the most accurate data possible.  Experimental results shall be analyzed and correlations developed in accordance with the objectives of the specific test series, comparing test behavior and environment with propulsion and space transportation application behavior and environment.  Historical property test data, material pedigree, and test techniques shall be used in the failure analysis when analyzing current test data and test techniques. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from Southern Research Institute (SRI), Birmingham, Alabama, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 which implements 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  This effort involves the testing of materials and the generation of testing data that are used in human-rated propulsion systems, which is critical in the mitigation of risks associated with the operation of those systems.  Due to the nature of the effort required, SRI is the only known source with the capability to generate test results with demonstrated reliability (i.e., repeatability, accuracy, and resolution) at extreme and typically non-standard testing conditions such as high temperature testing up to 5000 degrees F.  SRI is the only known source that can provide the unique combination of data understanding (i.e., failure mechanisms, component and specimen processing, specimen testing conditions, specimen design, component operation conditions, and data history), reliability, and component design accuracy to enable the most efficient and effective operating system to meet NASA’s goals, thus allowing for the safest system.  SRI uniquely provides an ability to obtain maximum data understanding, data reliability, and design accuracy, using a unique combination of properties, such as tensile, compression, flexure strengths, in-plane shear strength with 45 degree tension, and in-plane shear strength with 45 degree compression configurations for composites and monolithic ceramic materials at temperatures greater than 5000 degrees F.  Only SRI has demonstrated they can generate specific heat data, unrestrained electrical conductivity data, thermal expansion data, Rumanian in-plane shear data, saddle in-plane shear data, and torsional in-plane shear data, creep with a circumferential coupon data, interlaminar shear data, double notch shear data, and tensile creep data at temperatures greater than 4600 degrees F, as well as fatigue data at a frequency of greater than 500 Hz, load ratio of 0.1, and temperature of 1800 degrees F.  Only SRI has demonstrated they can generate biaxial tension-tension and compression-torsion testing data from -250 degrees F to 1500 degrees F, among other testing capabilities.  This combination of unique data is necessary to produce and operate these human-rated propulsion systems with the most accurate hardware designs and design safety margin.   2.  The data generated by SRI from room temperature to 5000 degrees F is the only data validated to model the Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) and 1st stage Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) nozzle ablative material.  All of the ablative nozzle data used for thermo-structural analytical models to support flight and flight anomaly investigation is generated by SRI.  Critical thermal properties for the External Tank (ET) composite nose-cap used to perform the thermo-structural analysis were generated by SRI along with lot and individual cone testing to verify flight worthiness on initial flight articles.  No other source has been qualified to produce this thermal data.   3.  SRI is the only organization that has developed a material property database from room temperature to 5000 degrees F on the graphite throat used in the Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) Booster Separation Motor (BSM).  This database is used in the thermo-structural analysis used for BSM.  They provided test and failure analysis on the recent BSM throat factor of safety investigation and will generate the database for the new graphite material currently being qualified for the BSM built by ATK Thiokol.  Use of the BSM is expected to continue to the CLV system and continued access to SRI expertise is necessary. 4.  SRI is the only known source of elevated temperature permeability with the specimen under a tensile or compressive load.  Further, SRI is the only firm with analog test capability which has been used to develop unique data to develop and validate thermal models for RSRM nozzle ablative liners.  The restrained thermal growth test developed by and available exclusively from SRI is also necessary in characterizing and modeling next generation nozzle materials for the RSRM and 1st stage CLV. 5.  SRI is the only source to have generated high temperature mechanical and thermal properties for Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) on-orbit repair material or Non-Oxide Adhesive eXperimental (NOAX).  This data provides both an understanding of the characteristics governing the NOAX behavior and supports the only thermal-structural analysis model of NOAX known to exist. This unique expertise and understanding of this critical shuttle system material is available in no other organization and is essential in support of NASA efforts to develop a RCC repair material in the event of damage to the thermal protection system. 6.  SRI is the only organization that has developed a material property database on the cryogenic foam used in the Shuttle External Tank.  This data provides both understanding of the characteristics governing the foam loss (and resultant shuttle orbiter tile damage) and supports the only thermo-structural analysis model of the ET foam known to exist.	This unique expertise and understanding of this critical shuttle system material is available in no other organization and is essential in support of MSFC efforts to develop a superior foam which will not damage the Orbiter’s thermal protection system.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 6, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>USAID announces its intention to solicit for an 18 month activity named INMA. (In the Arabic language, INMA means "growth".)  INMA is intended to improve agricultural productivity and provide agricultural business development services to USAID beneficiaries in the 18 governorates in Iraq. Opportunities for agribusiness development and growth exist throughout Iraq.  However, security levels, specific geographic and technical needs, and opportunities for enduring impact vary.  The activity will begin operations in locations of strategic importance, as directed by USAID, and expand as the security environment in Iraq permits.  This USAID assistance to Iraq will be coordinated with other U.S. Government organizations, including the US Embassy, the US Department of Agriculture, and the US Military.  This project will be flexible and responsive.  It will improve agriculture and agribusiness across the spectrum of security conditions, needs, and opportunities in Iraq and allow for adjustments as the situation fluctuates.  The objective of the INMA activity is to increase economic opportunities for Iraqis by expanding the competitiveness of the private sector with a focus on agricultural enterprises.  The agricultural sector faces a number of constraints including outdated technology, a highly distorted system of incentives that includes subsidized agricultural inputs and a pervasive command economy mentality.  Agility and creativity are necessary to address these constraints and to take advantage of opportunities created in the dynamic atmosphere of Iraq.   The activityji will achieve this by taking a systemic approach in addressing all of the elements in a value chain -- from field to fork.  The technical areas are:   a) agricultural productivity at the farm-level; b) appropriate technology to disseminate market information to buyers and sellers; c)  soil reclamation and water resource management; d) competitiveness of agribusiness enterprises; and e) alliances to promote domestic and foreign partnerships for new and existing Iraqi agribusinesses.  This activity may be extended based on availability of funds and extension of Mission strategy.  Posting of the solicitation is expected o/a late November 2006.  Please do not contact the Mission with queries before this time.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with AMTEC Corporation of Huntsville, AL (AMTEC) for MLRS Rocket and Missile Reset/Retrofit, Recovery, and Demilitarization Total Program Integratio n Support, to include required services and supplies, in support of the Precision Fires Rocket and Missile Systems Project of the Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM).  The proposed acquisition is directed to AMTEC pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as imp lemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Since program requirement inception AMTEC has been the only provider of services and is the only contractor capable of continuing to  provide the required highly skilled contractor support consisting of scientists, engineers, technicians, chemical engineers, chemists, and environmental and safety specialists with unique hands-on expertise in state-of-the-art missile/rocket recycling and  demilitarization operations, including MLRS, to ensure that the program requirements are met from a technical, operational, programmatic, and business perspective.  This acquisition will continue and build-up the prior work of AMTEC and it has been determ ined that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered through competition.  Contractor total program integration support is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of upgrade, recove ry, and demilitarization technologies for MLRS operations, determine the over-all state of readiness and risks to initiating MLRS upgrade and MLRS Retrofit/Demilitarization (R/D) operations; and performance of the necessary planning functions. In addition to study and planning support, contractor support is required to integrate selected technologies into prototype capabilities for execution of low rate initial operations, evolve the low rate prototype capability to full rate operations, and execute operati ons and maintenance (O&M) to upgrade, recover resources, and demilitarize the MLRS stockpile to meet the through-put requirements established for the program. Spiral development support shall also be required to evolve the full rate capability to its desir ed objective capability; meet the needs of additional MLRS upgrades to other special mission payloads, (e.g., smoke and illumination); and evolve into Centers of Excellence at multiple GOCO sites to meet the needs of PEO Missiles and Space and serve as a m issiles and rockets upgrade, recovery, and demilitarization Center of Excellence for all of the DoD Services. This action is not open to foreign participation.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described suppli es or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.  The proposed contract action is for services f or which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties who believe they can perf orm this requirement without substantial duplication of cost to the Government are invited to submit a written narrative statement of capability, no more than 15 pages in length, to include detailed technical information sufficient to permit agency analysi s in order to determine bona fide capability to meet the Governments requirements.  In order to be responsive, the statement must demonstrate:  (1) a history of proven experience in developing, operating and maintaining rocket retrofit, recovery, and demi litarization systems; and (2) the ability to im mediately assume the on-going project without disruption to current operations.  Responses without the required documentation will be considered nonresponsive.  The above stated information must be received no later than 15 days after publication of this s ynopsis, should cite number W9113M-06-R-9999, and should be mailed to the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801.  Contracting Officer is Mr. Billy Lemley, SMDC-RDCM-ST, (256) 955-3441, or e-mail billy.lemley@ smdc.army.mil.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of dete rmining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may submit a response that will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquires and/or responses will not be accepted.

Replacing and installing a new system, to include testing, would require a tremendous amount of work effort (additional time and w ork effort) resulting in additional costs to the Government.  Thus, purchasing the UxValiodator Stability Augmentation, Stabilator Test Set has been determined to be in the interest of the Government.

(Additionally, a second RFP # 2006-N-08556 will be issued as a full and open competition with different tasks from this 8(a) small business set-aside RFP. The particulars on the full and open RFP will be provided by separate synopsis.) The RFP reserves the right of CDC to make multiple awards and compete task orders among the awardees.     The term of the awarded contract(s) including all options will be 10 years, beginning around June 1, 2007.     The RFP will be available only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov/ . All responsible 8(a) small businesses may submit a proposal for consideration in response to the RFP.     A wage determination has not been requested since the requirement involves meaningful numbers of professional employees as defined in FAR Subpart 22.11.

The mission of NCBDDD is to promote the health of babies, children, and adults, and enhance the potential for full, productive living including:

*       Identifying the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities
*       Helping children to develop and reach their full potential
*       Promoting health and well-being among people of all ages with disabilities
Activities for which task orders may be issued:
1. Development and Implementation of Training Programs

a.       Training Programs, relevant to the NCBDDD mission, would include development and delivery of Professional Education programs, Public Education Programs, Orientation and Skill-based programs to providers.     

b.       More specifically, the Contractor shall be required to perform the following types of training activities:

(1)     Develop course curriculum, including training materials, for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(2) Provide qualified Instructors and/or Facilitators for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(3)     Secure subject matter experts to use in developing, adapting training materials, or conducting training sessions for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(4) Develop web-based, CD-ROM, or other electronic based training programs for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

                     (5) Adapt existing materials for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

                     (6) Develop Educational Packets for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

                     (7)     Evaluate materials before broad dissemination (pre-testing)

                     (8)     Acquire CME or CEU credits for training programs/materials

                     (9)       Develop and implement a plan for promoting the training materials/program

                   (10) Develop and implement a plan for evaluating the training materials/program


2,     Scientific Forums

NCBDDD serves as a convener and facilitator to bring many sectors of society together to solve problems related to the mission.     Sectors that NCBDDD routinely interacts with include other government agencies, health care professionals, business/industry, educational professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy groups interested in specific disease conditions or health topics.     NCBDDD wants to ensure that events/conferences are planned, implemented, and evaluated to achieve purposes that are aligned with its mission.     Scientific Forums on NCBDDD?s topics must involve constituents and scientists who may have     disease conditions and/or disabilities that the Center studies.     This often requires involvement of specialist interpreters (with scientific training) and/or technology aids that are not usual and customary in typical conference logistics contracts. The role of contract holders under this contract is to coordinate the activities surrounding the identification of potential conference/forum attendees and speakers and assisting in the development of topical materials/agendas, etc.

The Conference logistics will not be provided under this contract, but will be provided through vendors holding HHS conference support/event planning Blanket Purchase Agreements. Conference logistical support includes managing of events and meeting logistics including inviting participants and managing registration, travel, etc.; arranging for audio-visual and other special equipment, facilities arrangements including set up, back drop, sound systems, etc.

3. Preparation of Health Education Products

a.       The Contractor shall provide support for the preparation and production of materials as specified in individual task orders.     Support for any given item may range from simply typing and editing recorded, handwritten or draft-type materials to conducting all stages of development, including research, original writing, and design.     Capabilities to produce camera-ready copies and presentation slides of materials will be necessary.

b.       Because some tasks will require the collection of large amounts of information and user-friendly access to that information once collected, some initiatives may require development of small databases.     Both paper (camera-ready) copy and computer diskette files shall be made available for all documents in the format and computer program specified in the task order.     Examples of specific types of materials required by the Government may include meeting minutes and reports, guidance documents, policy reports, manuscripts, and other documents.

4. Services in the Planning and Development of Workshop, Conference and Other Presentations

The Contractor shall provide support services in organizing NCBDDD sponsored meetings, workshops, conferences, and other presentations as specified in individual task orders.

Services may include working with partners and/ or providers to develop curricula and materials, locating and arranging for qualified instructors, coordinating and providing exhibit materials, securing audio visual equipment, securing sign language interpreters and TDDY equipment for hearing impaired attendees; making other necessary accommodation for visually and physically impaired attendees, etc., when required by the task order.  Conference logistics will be provided by others.

<DESC>The General Services Administration, Public Building Services (GSA/PBS), Tenant and Property Operations, Manhattan Acquisition Unit (2POA-M) on behalf of the Regional Historic Preservation Office, intends to procure the following Specialized Historic Preservation A-E Services:

The work described below concerns the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House at 1 Bowling Green, NYC.  The building is a historic landmark and will celebrate its centennial next year.  All design and construction work connected with this building must be coordinated with GSA's Regional Historic Preservation Officer (RHPO).

In August of 2006 marble pieces fell from vertical interior surfaces.  Steps were taken to either remove the marble or temporarily secure it in place to alleviate further dangerous situations.  A-E will be required to:
1. Do a survey of all the stone paneling throughout the building.  
2. Panels exhibiting less than safe adherence shall be discreetly marked for:
a)	Immediate repair/reattachment (i.e. within first 30 days of a construction contract)
b)	Longer term repair/reattachment (to be done after the immediate panels are corrected.)
3. In addition to the discreet marking of panels create a survey drawing identifying the panels in need of repair/reattachment.
4. Prepare a report describing the methods used to do the survey as well as the results.
5. Prepare specifications/drawings depicting the methods that a contractor must employ to repair/reattach the faulty panels.  The detail in the specs/drawings shall be clear enough to permit qualified contractors to bid on and carry out the needed repairs/reattachments.
6. Recommend at least three contractors that have performed similar restoration work.
7. Prepare estimates of the envisioned construction work.
8. It is noted that some panels have already been removed or broken.  It is desired, to the extent possible, to repair/reinstall these panels. Panels falling into this category shall be specifically highlighted in your report.   If panels are beyond saving then replacement panels closely resembling the original shall be fully detailed and specified.

Selected A-E must have past performance of historic preservation work.
No solicitation, request for proposal or request for quote is currently available for this procurement.  Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the GSA/PBS/RHPO requirements described herein may submit a response no later than Thursday October 5, 2006, to the POC listed below by 3:30 p.m. EST to be considered:

General Services Administration, Public Building Service, 
Tenant and Property Operations, Manhattan Acquisition Unit, 
26 Federal Plaza, Room 1655, New York, New York, 10278
Attention: James K. Smith.  

All interested parties are required to submit their qualifications to the Contracting Officer in the form of SF 330.  Submit to the above referenced address and include the routing symbol (2POA-M) to ensure proper delivery.  Please verify that all required information is submitted and accurate.  Firms should include all relevant information about past design projects similar in type to this project.  This is NOT a request for proposals.

Pertinent factors for consideration for qualification for this project, listed in order of importance are:

1. Selected A-E shall have proven historic preservation capability. 2. Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm with the type of services required. 3. Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and record of working together as a team. 4. Capacity of the firm to perform the work (including any specialized work) within the time limitations. 5. Past record of performance with historic preservation.

Respondents should be advised that work may be required to be performed after normal business hours so as not to disturb tenants of the building.  The selected A-E shall provide their own material (including but not limited to ladders, scaffolds, safety gear, etc.) as may be necessary to conduct the survey.  The winning bidder shall be required to apply for security clearances for those employees intending to enter and work in the building. Any parties that believe they can meet the requirements of this project must ensure that their submission includes the following information:

 	Brief resumes of the key personnel expected to be involved in the work detailing their qualifications related to historical preservation.
 	The method of doing the survey to determine the soundness and safety of the panels shall be briefly described and should include a description of "go, no-go" criteria.  In other words, what level of survey reading would indicate a poorly adhered panel (i.e. requiring remedial repair) and what level indicates a well adhered safe and sound panel.

<DESC>Upon recommendation of the General Services Administration (GSA) Regional A/E Evaluation Board, the following firms, in no particular order, have been invited to participate in Stage Two of the A/E selection process for this project:

MERRICK & Company, Aurora, CO
CH2MHILL, Englewood, CO
S.A. Miro, Inc., Denver, CO




The General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission architects and engineers to maintain and modernize our legacy federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Denver Federal Center (DFC)is a federal campus located in Lakewood, Colorado on 670 acres of land.  Originally, the site was developed for a small arms ammunition plant that was built in 1941 to support the World War II effort.  After the war, the site was adapted as a Federal complex for office, lab and warehouse use.  Currently, there is approximately 3.9 million RSF, 7,000 parking spaces and 90 buildings which houses approximately 30 agencies and bureaus.  The DFC is surrounded by 4 major thoroughfares providing easy and direct access from downtown Denver, Metro Denver, Colorado Springs and Golden for tenant agencies, customers and associates.  

The project involves the complete replacement of domestic and fire water lines, complete replacement of sanitary sewer, partial replacement of storm water lines, electrical, and telecommunications lines and will provide a reliable utility infrastructure that will allow GSA to continue providing service to tenant agencies for the next 50 years. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of an existing pump station and wet wall and the construction of a new pump station, wet well, and associated water system components, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English units. NEW WORK IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE DONE IN METRIC UNLESS THERE IS A CLEAR RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS.   THE RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS IS THAT THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTING OR BEING INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING ENGLISH UNIT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS 50 TO 60 YEARS OLD.

The proposed project includes:
•	Updating the sanitary sewer master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Developing a water system master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Replace existing pump station and wet well.
•	Installing two new alternate water supply connections and installing additional piping loop connections and isolation valves.
•	Combine fire protection water system supply piping with the domestic water piping to have a single supply system, per Denver Water’s design and construction requirements.  This also includes the installation of new hydrant assemblies.
•	Partial Replacement of sanitary sewer system collection lines and manhole rehabilitation.
•	Replace a portion of existing overhead communication lines with new underground lines.
•	Install approximately one mile of duct bank to replace overhead wire systems and connect dead-end electrical loops.
•	Replace electrical distribution switchgear components.
•	, sustainability goals, and customer agency requirements.  In addition, because this work is on a secured federal campus, security clearances are required prior to working on the site.

<DESC>On June 9, 2006, GSA selected CH2MHill for the Utility Infrastructure Renovation at the Denver Federal Center.

The General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission architects and engineers to maintain and modernize our legacy federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Denver Federal Center (DFC)is a federal campus located in Lakewood, Colorado on 670 acres of land.  Originally, the site was developed for a small arms ammunition plant that was built in 1941 to support the World War II effort.  After the war, the site was adapted as a Federal complex for office, lab and warehouse use.  Currently, there is approximately 3.9 million RSF, 7,000 parking spaces and 90 buildings which houses approximately 30 agencies and bureaus.  The DFC is surrounded by 4 major thoroughfares providing easy and direct access from downtown Denver, Metro Denver, Colorado Springs and Golden for tenant agencies, customers and associates.  

The project involves the complete replacement of domestic and fire water lines, complete replacement of sanitary sewer, partial replacement of storm water lines, electrical, and telecommunications lines and will provide a reliable utility infrastructure that will allow GSA to continue providing service to tenant agencies for the next 50 years. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of an existing pump station and wet wall and the construction of a new pump station, wet well, and associated water system components, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English units. NEW WORK IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE DONE IN METRIC UNLESS THERE IS A CLEAR RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS.   THE RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS IS THAT THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTING OR BEING INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING ENGLISH UNIT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS 50 TO 60 YEARS OLD.

The proposed project includes:
•	Updating the sanitary sewer master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Developing a water system master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Replace existing pump station and wet well.
•	Installing two new alternate water supply connections and installing additional piping loop connections and isolation valves.
•	Combine fire protection water system supply piping with the domestic water piping to have a single supply system, per Denver Water’s design and construction requirements.  This also includes the installation of new hydrant assemblies.
•	Partial Replacement of sanitary sewer system collection lines and manhole rehabilitation.
•	Replace a portion of existing overhead communication lines with new underground lines.
•	Install approximately one mile of duct bank to replace overhead wire systems and connect dead-end electrical loops.
•	Replace electrical distribution switchgear components.
•	Experience working within contaminated environmental areas is required.

The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings)Experience working within contaminated environmental areas is required.

The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), sustainability goals, and customer agency requirements.  In addition, because this work is on a secured federal campus, security clearances are required prior to working on the site.

The Government intends to award without discussion but reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary in making the award decision. Questions that may have a material change to the RFP will be received until 3 October 2006 at Noon EST.  Questions and answers will be posted on FBO.  Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.  Techniques utilizing past performance information and price will be evaluated; therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror. Solicitation HM1576-06-R-0007 is scheduled for release on 21 September 2006, with a closing date of 11 October 2006. No telephone, fax, email or mailed requests for the RFP will be honored.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, whether before or after RFP closing, with no obligations. Proposal preparation cost will be borne by offerors submitting proposals in response to the solicitation. Solicitation will include Statement of Work (SOW).

<DESC>The Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Program is re-distributing the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), BAMS UAS, Potential ACAT (1) Draft (U) dated 5 December 2003. The classification of the ORD is SECRET/NOFORN. The ORD is the exact document previously released to Industry in 2004.  The re-distribution of the ORD is intended to make available information that could be helpful to potential offerors. An updated Performance Based System Specification is scheduled to be provided in the BAMS UAS draft Request For Proposal, anticipated to be released in the October 2006 timeframe. 

The Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) will provide a persistent maritime Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) data collection and dissemination capability to the fleet.  The BAMS UAS will deliver capability enabling the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force (MPRF) to meet the Navy's maritime ISR requirements.  BAMS UAS full operational capability will provide for up to five simultaneous orbits worldwide.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the BAMS UAS is defined as one base unit with sufficient assets, technical data, training systems, and enough spares and support equipment to operationally support one persistent ISR orbit and is planned for FY13.  At IOC, the BAMS UAS missions will include, but are not limited to, maritime surveillance, collection of enemy order of battle information, battle damage assessment, port surveillance, communication relay, and support of the following missions - maritime interdiction, surface warfare, battlespace management, and targeting for maritime and littoral strike missions.

The modifications to the SOO were an outcome of internal reviews and discussions within the government as well as Industry feedback.   A draft RFP is anticipated to be released in the October 2006 timeframe, followed by the formal RFP release in January 2007.  The draft documents are located on the BAMS UAS website found at https://uav.navair.navy.mil. (once on the site, select BAMS UAS on the left side of the screen; links to the documents are on the top of the BAMS page).    

The Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) will provide a persistent maritime Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) data collection and dissemination capability to the fleet.  The BAMS UAS will deliver capability enabling the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force (MPRF) to meet the Navy's maritime ISR requirements.

Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the BAMS UAS is defined as one base unit with sufficient assets, technical data, training systems, and enough spares and support equipment to operationally support one persistent ISR orbit and is planned for FY13.  At IOC, the BAMS UAS missions will include, but are not limited to, maritime surveillance, collection of enemy order of battle information, battle damage assessment, port surveillance, communication relay, and support of the following missions - maritime interdiction, surface warfare, battlespace management, and targeting for maritime and littoral strike missions.

Comments and recommendations should be sent to the contacts listed below. Comments and recommendations are requested to be submitted at the earliest possible time. The Government will accept comments up to the time of final RFP issuance; however it should be noted that comments received earlier in the acquisition process are more likely to be reviewed and potentially incorporated into the documentation.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation notice has been modified to change the response date.  Questions and Answers have also been uploaded.  This announcement serves as the only solicitation and no further Request for Quotes (RFQ) will be issued.  Please see the uploaded file for all system and functional requirements pertaining to this acquisition.  The U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has a requirement for the development and implementation of a Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) to be used in conjunction with the Department's intranet platform EDNet to detect and disapprove any unauthorized wireless devices or networks.  EDNet currently forbids the installation or use of wireless networks without the permission of the EDNet Director of Security and Reliability Assurance.   In the event that a rogue wireless device attempts to connect or bridge EDNet, the WIPS must be designed in such a way to actively alert EDNet Security Operations team members of the threat so that appropriate actions can be taken to prevent intrusion.

Period of Performance:  Twelve months from the date of contract award (Warranty Support).

All offerors responding to this RFQ must posses the capability to meet all functional, system, and customer requirements as stated in the uploaded Wireless Network Detection document to be eligible for award consideration.  The date of delivery for the ED customized WIPS system will be within 30 days from date of award.  All interested offerors must submit quotes in writing to the identified point of contact via email no later than the close of business September 25, 2006 EST.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.     No contract will be awarded.     This is a request for information only.  


The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting Market Research to ascertain if there are any commercial sources that can provide alternative means by which printed notices can be provided to the public.  SSA currently generates printed notices in Advanced Format Presentation (AFP) file(s) that are formatted for printing with a 12-point font.  SSA is looking to have AFP format file(s) converted to one or more of the following formats: 1) audio CD; 2) audio cassette;  3) Braille documents; 4) large print (18-20 point font) format  or 5) 508-compliant text-based format.   The majority of these notices contain tables with headers.  As part of the conversion process, row and column headers must be identified, and data cells in a table must be associated with header cells.  Therefore, SSA is seeking capability statements and estimated pricing from commercial sources for these services. SSA anticipates that there will be approximately 200,000 unique files per year that need transfer to one of these types of media. Each unique file may have a page count that varies from 2 to 60 pages with an average of 4 pages per file. 

Please provide a narrative of your capabilities to meet the following requirements: 

Transfer from 12-point AFP format to audio CD, audio cassette, Braille, large print or 508-compliant text-based;
Provide standardized header information;
Translation of tables;
Turn around time-2 to 5 workdays; 
Mailing individual media using data contained within the AFP file;
Vendor's quality assurance practices;
Vendor's daily output capability;

Please provide this information no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, September 27, 2006 to Jacqueline Lessig via email at jacqueline.lessig@ssa.gov. 

Any information provided, including estimated pricing, will not be considered to be confidential procurement information.

<DESC>THIS RFI CAN BE VIEWED IN PDF FORMAT AT http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/ERTP/ERTP%20RFI.pdf.   



Request for Information (RFI) for Planning Purposes ONLY: 
DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

The purpose of this RFI is to gather industry input on the proposed pricing structure of the follow-on Environmental Response Training Program contract. The current contract (68-C-03-039) will expire on January 31, 2008, and EPA is in the early stages of developing the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the follow-on contract. 

The Government requests that industry review the proposed contract pricing structure and the attached PWS and provide comments.  The Government intends to review the comments from and take them into consideration when developing the final RFP.

CURRENT CONTRACT PRICING STRUCTURE 

The current contract type is Cost-Plus Fixed Fee.  Other direct costs such as travel, shipping, supplies, and subcontractors are cost reimbursable.  The period of performance of the contract is five years, with no option periods.  Offerors should read Exhibit 2, Performance Work Statement, for complete details of the tasks performed under the current contract.

PROPOSED PRICING STRUCTURE

The proposed pricing structure for the follow-on contract will include a Fixed-Price portion, an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) portion, Option Quantities, and Option Periods.

Fixed Price
The proposed fixed price portion will include presentation and routine updating of all core-training courses listed in Exhibit 1.  The duration of each course is generally five days and will be conducted at locations throughout the country.  The frequency of when each course will be offered is provided in Exhibit 1.  Travel costs will be reimbursable as an Other Direct Cost in accordance with FAR Part 31.205-46.  A fixed price shall be provided for each course per contract year.
  
IDIQ
It is anticipated that the IDIQ portion will be used for development of new courses, significant editing of existing courses, or in any other situation deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer.  The IDIQ portion will NOT be used for routine development of courses.  The contracting officer will authorize the use of the IDIQ portion.  It is anticipated that the IDIQ portion will be used sparingly.

Optional Quantities
Optional quantities will be available for additional offerings of each course.  It is anticipated that the optional quantities will be exercised in blocks of five (5) additional course offerings, and will be available for each course.  For instance, if at the time of contract award, the Advanced Groundwater Investigation (AGWI) (165.7) course is scheduled to be offered 30 times throughout the entire period of performance of the contract and additional offerings are necessary, the contracting officer will exercise one option quantity for five (5) additional courses.  The additional courses will be priced per the current year fixed price.

Optional Period/Award Term
It is anticipated that the base period of the contract will be three (3) years and the Government will have the option to extend that period of performance either through option periods, or through award terms.  Option periods or award terms may be for one year each or two years each, the final structure of the period of performance has not yet been determined.  The maximum period of performance of this contract will be five (5) years.  Whether the Government chooses option periods or award terms, the decision to extend the period of performance will be made by the government and will be based on contractor performance, availability of funding, and the Government?s continued need for the requirement.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

(ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE TRAINING PROGRAM)
												

A.	BACKGROUND
	
	The Environmental Response Center is responsible for developing and managing the Office of Emergency and Remedial Response's Environmental Response Training Program.  This U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) program is designed to train personnel from federal, state, and local government agencies in techniques and methods for preventing and mitigating chemical releases while protecting the health and safety of response personnel and the public.

		As part of EPA's comprehensive mandate for protecting the public and the environment from chemical incidents resulting from transportation accidents, releases from industrial operations, deliberate releases and hazards associated with the investigations and cleanup of contaminated sites, this training program was developed to provide courses in safety and technical operations related to hazard identification, evaluation, control and decontamination.
	
		The training presented under this training program last from 1 to 5 days.  They provide participants with fundamental information about the subjects covered.  They do provide a foundation for developing knowledge and skills in a variety of response activities.  All presentations emphasize the practical application of instructional material through problem-solving, case studies, lectures, workshops, demonstrations, exercises, and special training sessions.
	
		Eight weeks of training were presented to 200 participants in the first year of the training program in fiscal year 1980.  During fiscal year 2000, 215 weeks of training were attended by over 5,300 students.  It is anticipated that this level of effort will be significantly increased during the next few years to facilitate domestic terrorist response.  Approximately 50% of the total weeks of training are done at the training facilities in Edison, New Jersey or Cincinnati, Ohio.  The remaining courses are presented at various locations throughout the United States through arrangements with EPA's ten regional offices.     
	
B.	SCOPE OF WORK
	
		The Contractor shall organize, manage, and present the ERC Environmental Response Training Program as directed in work assignments issued by the Contracting Officer.  This will include the following:
	
1.	The Contractor shall operate two training facilities.  The Contractor shall provide adequate classroom, office, storage, and work space for the main training facility.  Present facilities consist of 3 classrooms, 5 storage areas, 5 office areas, and 5 large laboratory/exercise areas.  (Minimum space requirements for main facility:  3 classrooms that accommodate 35 people each; 2200 square feet of storage area; 4400 square feet of office space, and 4,000 square feet of laboratory/exercise space.  The contractor shall also have access to an outdoor area for the purpose of conducting outdoor training exercises.)  This amounts to approximately 25,000 square feet of space exclusive of the outdoor area use.  The Government shall provide the required classroom, storage, and laboratory/exercise areas for the Edison facility.  The Edison facility has 16,000 square feet of space.  
	
2.	The Contractor shall present the 19 training topics identified in the attached schedule of classes of 2001 (Exhibit 1).  The title and content of each will be as set forth in Exhibit 1.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Enterprise Operation Centers (IRM/OPS/SIO/EOC).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP DL380 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, Department of State infrastructure commonality, as well as IRM/EOC’s operational requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/SIO/ESOC has identified that HP DL380 Servers are an integral component of EOC’s ESX Virtual Server Infrastructure. The equipment listed above is required to provide additional Host servers for the ESX infrastructure thereby increasing the capacity of the ESX Host Farms and augmenting the existing backup/restoration and disaster recovery infrastructure within the ESOC’s Virtual Server Architecture.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the defined requirements as a key component of IRM/OPS/SIO/EOC’s Virtual Server Architecture.

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements and the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ systems environment and visa generation requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another manufacturer or company.CA/CST has identified the Dell PowerEdge 2950 Server equipped with more recent and powerful dual-core Intel Xeon 5100 processors for their superior performance and lower power consumption as the optimal mid-sized platform to support the Congressionally mandated 2008 Diversity Visa program.  The introduction and use of dual core technology is deemed essential to the successful conduct of the Diversity Visa program as it is the most cost effective means of enabling the Bureau to increase processing speeds by more than 50%.  The processors will provide the Oracle SW application with extra caching capabilities and the additional memory will enhance the Bureau’s ability to maintain operational status in the event of unexpected memory failures.  In summation, the Dell PowerEdge 2950 w/dual core Intel Xenon processor was judged to offer the most power and redundancy of any server of its class, and was determined to be best suited to support the Diversity Visa program. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements. The Dell server equipment was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureau’s Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and is being added to the Consular HW Baseline.   The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which, in the interests of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration, has established an environment comprised solely of Dell HW.  The continued use of Dell servers obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple HW manufacturer’s server configurations or to manage multiple vendor’s out years support and maintenance agreements.  Since this equipment is required to meet operational requirements, CA/CST/II must take physical possession of this HW as soon as possible.   Even if another manufacturer’s equipment identical to the Dell PowerEdge2950 in terms of specifications, configuration and functionality were to become available at this juncture, they could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that they would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by September of this year.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS In the event a radioactive alarm is issued by one of the fixed radiation detectors in the mail screening area of SA-32, a radionuclide identifier is required to determine the type(s) of radioisotopes that are present in the mail that caused the alarm.  This will provide critical information to determine how to safely handle the mail in question.  The radionuclide identifier will also provide critical information for other potential radioactive scenarios at Main State and other DoS annexes. Since there are several manufacturers of radionuclide identifiers, DESD conducted market research to determine which system is best suited for DoS’ requirements.  DESD identified and evaluated the following products: ·	identiFinder manufactured by ICX Target Instruments, Inc. ·	ICS 4000 manufactured by the XRF Corporation ·	SAM-935 manufactured by Berkley Nucleonics Corporation ·	Inspector 1000 manufactured by Canberra, Inc. ·	Rad-ID manufactured by D-tect Systems As part of the market research, DESD reviewed two reports (issued 2005 and 2006), entitled Results of Test and Evaluation of Radionuclide Identifiers for the Department of Homeland Security, conducted under the technical direction of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  In addition, DESD participated in demonstrations or borrowed the above referenced radionuclide identifiers to more thoroughly evaluate their performance and ease of use.  Based on DESD’s review of the product specifications, published reports and performance evaluation, the identiFinder was determined to be the best product for DoS’ requirements. Diplomatic Security’s Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) group also determined the identiFinder was the best product when they were conducting market research for radionuclide identifiers to be shipped to overseas posts.  WMD recently purchased 125 identiFinders under a sole source acquisition.  In conclusion, DESD determined the identiFinder is the best radionuclide identifer based on DoS’ requirements.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a Request for Quotation numbered N65886-06-T-0004.

NAVAIR Depot Jacksonville, Florida has a requirement for E-6 Standardized General Markup Language (SGML) and Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) viewing capabilities. This requirement is being synopsized as a competitive, 100% small business set-aside acquisition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330 and a small business size standard of $23M. The contract type will be a commercial simplified acquisition purchase (SAP) with firm-fixed price Contract Line Items (CLINS) for CLIN 0001 Labor and cost reimbursable CLINs for 0002 ODC’s and 0003 Travel.

The specific requirements are as follows: TASK 1 Modify SMP system to utilize System Optimization for Web Server Enhancement. This IETM performance enhancement requires the restructure of the current IETM navigational files into hierarchical segments. Modifications would be required to reconfigure the IETM search system in order to accommodate the restructured navigational files. Task 2 SMP system to utilize AutoCAD files in IETM (viewer as part of build). This IETM system enhancement requires a programming effort to establish AutoCAD file format recognition within the IETM system and the IETM Installation Program will be expanded to include the provisions for installing the required AutoCAD plug that is required to render the files for view. Task 3 Modify SMP system to have ability to put calculation sheets in IETM. This IETM enhancement requires an initial one-time programming effort to accommodate the Calculation Sheet functionality within the IETM interface and the IETM build application and to develop the ground rules for individual calculation sheet development. This feature will support a dynamic calculation sheet environment where the calculation sheet content may be populated with automatically maintained referencing as is currently provided throughout the standard IETM content. A sample generic calculation sheet will be provided for testing. Task 4 Modify system to utilize the placement of video clips in the IETM. This IETM enhancement requires a programming effort to revise the current IETM infrastructure so that it may support the recognition of specific types of customer-provided video segments.

Contractor Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements The work performed under this contract will only be accomplished by individuals (in the employment of the Contractor or any Subcontractors) whose conduct is consistent with a Federal employee with like security levels, the requirements of this contract, and is acceptable to the Contracting Officer (CO).  The risk/sensitivity level designation of the activities performed under this contract is moderate risk.  Performance of this contract requires contractor personnel to have a Federal government-issued personal identification card before being allowed unsupervised access to a DOI [facility and/or information system].  The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will be the sponsoring official, and will make the arrangements for personal identify verification and card issuance.   Background investigations will be performed by the Office of Personnel Management unless otherwise specified by OPM.  The Government will bear the cost of the background investigations. Before starting work under this contract, a National Agency Check (NAC) will be conducted to verify the identity of the individual applying for clearance.  Upon successful completion of the NAC process, an identification card will be issued and access granted.   Simultaneously, a NAC with Inquiries (NACI) will be initiated to determine the individual's suitability for the position.  If the NACI adjudication is favorable, nothing more needs to be done.  If the adjudication is unfavorable, the credentials will be revoked.  In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the Government concerning the suitability of an individual to perform work under this contract, DOI shall have the right of final determination.  At least two weeks before the start of contract performance, the Contractor will identify all contractor and subcontractor personnel who will require [physical and/or logical] access for performance of work under this contract.  The Contractor must make their personnel available at the place and time specified by the COR in order to initiate screening and background investigations.  The following forms, or their equivalent, may be used to initiate the credentialing process: "	OPM Standard Form 85 or 85P "	OF 306 "	Fingerprint card (local procedures may require the fingerprinting to be done at a police station; in this case, any charges are to be borne by the contractor.) "	Release to Obtain Credit Information "	PIV card application (web-based) Contractor employees are required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination.  Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials.  Government personnel may contact the contractor personnel being screened or investigated in person, by telephone or in writing, and the Contractor agrees to make them available for such contact.   Alternatively, if an individual has already been credentialed by another agency through OPM, and that credential has not yet expired, further investigation may not be necessary.  Provide the COR with documentation that supports the individual's status. During performance of the contract, the Contractor will keep the COR apprised of changes in personnel to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes.  Cards that have been lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COR and Issuing Office within 24 hours.  Replacement will be at the contractor's expense.  If reissuance of expired credentials is needed, it will be coordinated through the COR. At the end of contract performance, or when a contractor employee is no longer working under this contract, the Contractor will ensure that all identification cards are returned to the COR.   This requirement must be incorporated into any subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have routine and regular unsupervised access to a Federally controlled facility for more than 180 calendar days or unsupervised access to a Federally controlled Level 3 or 4 information system. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement:  FAR 52.212-01 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS; FAR 52.212-02 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS; FAR 52.212-04 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS; FAR 52.212-05 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, following clauses apply under paragraph (b): 52.219-8, 52.222-03; 52.222-26; 52.222-35; 52.222-36; 52.222-37; The full text of these provisions and clauses may be accessed electronically at http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html.  Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation is determined to represent the best value to the Government.  In making the best value determination, the Government considers technical and past performance being equal in importance, and both being significantly more important than price.

Contractors shall provide pricing for the following qualified product:  Crossville 'Polished' porcelain tile category:  (1) regular field tile 2100 SF, size 12 inch x 12 inch, five sixteenths inch thick, style Cognac VS78; (2) Border tiles 1000 SF, size 12inch x 12inch, five sixteenth inch thick, style Elba Night VS79.  Contractor shall provide and install polished porcelain tile deck covering.  No QPL or Mil-Spec currently exists for these materials.  All products must meet the requirements of commercial standard A137.1.  A copy of this standard can be obtained from: Tile Council of America, Inc., 100 Clemson Research Blvd., Anderson, SC 29625, phone: 864-646-8453, fax:864-646-2821, URL: http:/www.tileusa.com.  Contractor shall remove existing deck covering down to bare metal surface.  Prepare and prime deck surface in accordance with NSTM Section 631.  Install an underlayment, adhesive and grout that is epoxy based.  The cement based underlayment products available will not hold up under forklift traffic.  The compressive strength is not high enough, and the underlayment has been seen to crumble, leading to failures and breakage of the porcelain tiles.  Additionally, the underlayment may not fully cure in the center of the non-permeable tiles.  Therefore, contractor shall provide ultra-lightweight underlayment (<1.0 lb/sf @ 1/4") that meets QPL-3135, Type II, Class 2, and that the adhesive and grout are also epoxy based.  Install approved underlayment to level surface and cover any raised areas across the surface area.  Install new porcelain tiles throughout entire areas specified iaw best commercial standards for this type of product and the fact that it is being installed on board a U.S. Navy ship.  Contractor shall understand how critical this deck leveling stage is to the overall success of the installation.  An non-leveled surface could result in deck failure and be reason for contract default for latent defect and or non-conformance to the specifications herein.  Recommend using a 3/8 notched trowel and contractor shall back butter the tile 100% for a nice level setting bed when installing border and field tiles.  Ship's representative shall choose final design.

Offerors shall quote a firm fixed price for labor, materials, and installation for removal and installation of 3100 SF.  Contractor shall maintain an approved log tracking system established by the contractor and certified by the ship?s designated representative (identified at pre-work planning conference) and shall serve to verify the scope of work completed, in this case 3100 SF.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Chief Technology Office.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Department of State approved Desktop IT equipment. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements of compatibility with existing operational equipment across the DS Enterprise. Because of the interchangeable parts supporting the equipment, it provides a cost effective process in managing an Enterprise asset that is used by DS in all of its CONUS locations. By standardizing on one baseline configuration, the management and support render to the end user is streamlined. DS/CTO/SMD/OPS has identified Dell Desktop equipment as a key component for DS desktop support. Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of State’s enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configurations that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components. These are essential management tools in support of non-CTO manned Resident and Field office support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement. CLARIFIED LINE ITEMS.

<DESC>The following is added to the original announcement:

A major objective will be to develop sound RFP documents that clearly and comprehensively articulate the performance requirements which will be the basis for the post-award design documentation (plans and specs) to be prepared by the Contractor's Design Agent (AE #2). It should be recognized that the AE (AE #1) effort for development of the design build Request-for-Proposal (RFP) needs to be tailored to the time available for development of the RFP.  The end date (established by law) for completion of BRAC construction, dictates that the time (and thus the associated effort) for preparation of the RFP need to be streamlined. It is estimated that 12 15 weeks will be allotted for preparation of the RFP. Expected RFP development-related work tasks include the following: some overall programming; documentation of existing conditions and available utility capacities; identification of utility connection points; performance criteria coordination; incorporation into the RFP, space requirements and associated outfitting requirements (performance based)- provided by the Government; incorporation into the RFP, space adjacency requirements provided by the Government; determination of temporary swing space requirements; topographic surveys, geotechnical services/soil borings; hazardous material surveys; preparation of cost estimates and cost analyses; and post construction award services, including technical review of the design provided by the Contractor's Design Agent (AE #2). 

It is noted that in addition to the RFP encompassing medical facility requirements, the RFP will also encompass some non-medical facility requirements, such as parking structures and admin space renovations. The work that the RFP encompasses could potentially exceed $400 million.

Because this contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000.00, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns.  The small disadvantaged business goal in the plan shall not be less than 15.88% of the subcontracted work.  The women-owned small business goal shall not be less than 14.22%.  A subcontracting plan is not required from firms classified as small businesses.

1.7	Navy Approach to Service Contracting	The Department of Navy (DoN) spends over $1 billion in annual obligations to meet global requirements for facility operations and maintenance provided through Facility Support Contracts (FSC) and additional billions to provide other base operations support services (OBOS).  The Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) has focused increased attention on re-engineering FSC contracts in response to customer and industry feedback, budget constraints, and the impact of a variety of contracting, program management and financial management regulations.  The Navy also supports the following principles:
1.7.1	Partnering Philosophy	The first principle is that the Navy views its contractors as partners and not just abstract service providers.  The Navy wants its contractors to succeed because partners' success drives the Navy's successful mission completion.  Within the bounds of acquisition policy the Navy intends to work to find solutions that will be beneficial to both the Government and its partners.
1.7.2	Contractor's Knowledge	The second principle is that the Navy will receive insightful management from its contractors.  This management will include the knowledge, skills, authority and willingness to use contractor resources to find better ways of serving Navy clients? strategic and operational goals and objectives.  The Navy's use of performance-based objectives evidences this principle.  Although performance work statements will typically contain several levels of performance assessment, the Navy wants its contractors to exercise maximum discretion within bounds of prudent risk management to adjust processes and resources needed to reach specified objectives at the highest performance level.
1.7.3	Industry Best Practices	The third principle is that the Navy will adopt industry best commercial practices and maintain state-of-the-art service delivery.  It is the Navy's and contractor's responsibility as partners to reach this goal.  To that end, the Navy's emphasis will be in evaluating performance objectives (end results).
1.8	Standard Template	Key to implementing a programmatic approach is using a standard template that ensures Navy-wide consistency yet affords appropriate tailoring to meet local needs.  This contract conforms to the standard template and has been tailored for this solicitation.  NAVFAC intends to use this template-based approach for future service contracts.  Offerors should develop an understanding of the template as part of performing due diligence in reaching an understanding of the Navy?s requirements and expectations.

The standard template contains 18 standard annexes.  Annex 1 will always contain information that is relevant to the entire scope of the contract.  Annex 2 contains on-site project management and administration requirements that are relevant to the entire scope of the contract.    Annexes 3 through 18 contain the technical information and requirements peculiar to that technical annex.  Within each technical annex, the organization of information and requirements are also standardized.  Specification item 1 will always contain General Information.  Specification item 2 will always contain the management and administrative requirements.  Specification item 3 will always contain the Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) requirements.  Specification item 4 will always contain the Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) requirements. All costs associated with Annexes 1 and 2 and Specification items 1 and 2 must be priced and distributed within Specification Item 3 of Annexes 3 through 18.
1.9	Navy PBSC Approach	The Navy?s approach to performance-based service contracting (PBSC) includes four component parts which are 1) performance outcomes, 2) measurable standards, 3) consideration of incentives, and 4) performance assessment plan. 

1.10	Technical Proposal Certification	The contractor warrants that its proposal incorporated herein by reference including, but not limited to, proposed approaches, staffing, methodology, or work plans, will meet the performance objectives set forth in this contract during execution thereof.  The contractor is not excused from meeting such performance objectives in the event such proposal proves inadequate as conceived or executed to meet such performance objectives.  The contractor understands that it bears all of the cost and performance risk associated with adopting acceptable additional (and/or alternative) means or methods of meeting the performance objective.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment #1 is to  (1) Provide the Government's response to questions received in response to this RFQ; and (2) change the CAT6e requirement to CAT6.

The questions and answers are as follows:
QUESTION 1:  What are your color requirements?  
Government?s Response:  There are none - nothing specific.

QUESTION 2:  The second line item of product calls for 62 boxes of CAT6e.  Right now they do not make CAT6e they make CAT5e or just plain CAT6 or CAT6 augmented, but not CAT6e.  Just need to get your specs on that cable to be clarified.   

Government?s Response:  CAT6 will meet the requirement.

QUESTION 3:  You stated that we will be shipping the product to 62 different locations.  Would you have a listing of states and how many destinations are in each state?  We are trying to get a handle on the shipping, because our shipping is ranging from $377 to CA, and like around $700 to HI.   

Government?s Response:  Two (2) each of 18/4 PL, 18/6 PL Wire, and 22/4 PL Wire will be shipped to each of the 62 locations.  One (1) each of the CAT6E PL wire will be shipped to each of the 62 locations. 

QUESTION 4:  Is the 124 boxes of 18/4 PL ,4-Conductor, Stranded, Overall Shielded, Plenum, CMP-CL2P, 1000? Pull Box the only "Shielded" wire?           

Government?s Response:  Only 18/4 is shielded - none of the others have to be.

All other terms and conditions of this RFQ remains the same.
