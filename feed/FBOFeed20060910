D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G4 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The HP ProLiant DL380 G4 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal configuration to meet the projects needs.  The above-mentioned equipment will be used to upgrade the Class Net server farm where HP ProLiant servers are already in use.  If the hardware changes, i.e., another manufacturer’s product is brought in, the ability to restore and back up the servers will be compromised since the same hardware is required for back ups and restore.  Since HP has proprietary BIOS and firmware, to get rid of the existing hardware would disrupt the ability to re-deploy servers in the event of a failure. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G4 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.
