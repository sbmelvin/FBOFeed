<DESC>The AFLCMC/EBDZ, Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) Program Office, plans to award a sole source contract for the engineering and FZU-63 fuze initiator support required to integrate the JPF FZU-63 with the advanced 2000 pound Legacy Warhead Improvement Program (LWIP) and any FZU-63 modifications which may be necessary to Kaman Precision Products, Inc. (KPPI), 6655 E. Colonial Drive, Orlando, FL, 32807-5200, on or before 31 August 2013. The effort will consist of engineering and qualification support and design analysis of any proposed solutions to the modified BLU-109 in regards to the FZU-63 and associated wiring and delivery of up to twenty-six (26) modified fuze initiators required for prototype, testing, and certification. Schedule requirements include prototype delivery by February 2014, flight testing in May 2014, and certification and low rate initial production (LRIP) decision in July 2015. The Government believes KPPI is currently the only responsible source for FMU-152A/B production. KPPI is currently the only contractor that has completed the design qualification and testing necessary to provide the Air Force with FZU technical support. <br />The FMU-152A/B is a cockpit-selectable bomb fuze employed in MK-80 series warheads (both guided and unguided variations), and both the 2000lb and 5000lb series Penetrator warheads. The FMU-152A/B fuze system consists of the fuze, the FZU-63/B fuze initiator, a closure ring, and power cable. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this contract with only one source under the statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). Interested parties must submit statements of capability (SOC) or a capabilities package addressing the following: (1) Demonstrated technical knowledge of the Joint Programmable Fuze (FMU-152A/B) requirements for operational performance, interface requirements for JDAM and other guided munitions/general purpose bombs, interface requirements for required US and Allied aircraft, and system safety requirements; (2) Adequate production facilities and production capabilities to produce and assemble the fuze initiator FZU-63/B and power cable, and produce or acquire associated sub-tier components; (3) Ability to perform acceptance and other required tests of fuze initiators in accordance with Contractor-developed and Government-approved plans; and (4) Ability to deliver fuze initiators on schedule. Responders to this synopsis will not be provided the results of the Government evaluation of their qualifying package. Responses to this synopsis must be submitted for receipt by the Government within 45 days of the publication date of this synopsis and must state whether the potential source is a small business concern IAW FAR 52.219-1. The NAIC Code/Size Standard is 332993/1,500 employees. <br />Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting Statements of Capability to provide engineering and FZU-63 fuze initiator support and produce and deliver up to twenty-six (26) modified fuze initiators. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all statements of capability received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above.

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

FOB destination and inspection at destination is required. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 05/30/13 . Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business.

All offers shall be in the English language and in US dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. <br /><br />REVERSE AUCTION NOTE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Warren Seymour, at warren.g.seymour.mil@mail.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

CONTACT INFORMATION IS ALSO IN THE BODY OF THIS SOLICITATION.**************** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the annual renewal of software licenses of CFD-ACE including CFD-GEOM, CFD-VIEW, multi-physics and stress modules to support CFD tasks. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) on a sole source basis. MSFC engineering uses this capability to model propellant dynamics in a variety of propulsion system components, particularly tanks. CFD-ACE has been identified as the proper tool for these analyses because of previous validation work and MSFC experience with the software. Technicians are trained in operation of the existing CFD-ACE software. Purchase of any other software system will require additional training to effectively operate. This training would require additional funding which is unavailable. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Kiera Spann at kiera.spann@nasa.gov or fax to 256-544-5028 no later than 4:30 p.m. CDT on Tuesday, May 21, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Design-Build/Design-Bid-Build Small Business Multiple Award Construction Contract (DB/DBB SB MACC), Various Locations, State of Hawaii.  This solicitation is being advertised as a 100% small business set-aside; it is a source selection procurement requiring both technical and price proposals. This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award multiple Indefinite Delivery /Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the procurement if only one proposal is received that offers the best value to the Government.

The primary NAICS Code is 236220 and the corresponding size standard is $33.5M average annual receipts over the last 3 fiscal years.
   The work includes, but is not limited to labor, supervision, tools, materials and equipment necessary to perform new construction, repair, alteration and related demolition of existing infrastructure based on Design-Build or Design-Bid-Build (Full Plans and Specifications) for infrastructure within the State of Hawaii.  Infrastructure is defined as 1) residential building construction for single family and/or multi-family housing; 2) nonresidential building construction for industrial buildings and warehouses; 3) nonresidential buildings, other than industrial buildings and warehouses; and 4) supporting improvements such as utilities, landscaping, airfields and roadways.  The areas of consideration will include, but not be limited to, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and miscellaneous Federal and other facilities.
  Task orders will be issued for the work that may require design and construction services.  In support of the Design-Build work, the Contractor shall employ the services of an architect/engineering professional experienced in the coordination of multi-disciplined architectural/engineering design efforts in all aspects of general building and new and renovation projects.  The scope of work will not include the more highly specialized waterfront projects.

This is a 2-Phase procurement.  The evaluation factors for Phase I are anticipated to be:  (a) Technical Approach, (b) Experience, (c) Past Performance and (d) Safety.  Phase I process requires potential Offerors to submit and the Government to evaluate Phase I evaluation factors.
  The Government will then short list a maximum of ten of the most qualified Phase I Offerors to compete for the Small Business Multiple Award Construction Contracts in Phase II.  Factor 1 will only be rated Acceptable or Unacceptable.  If an Offeror is rated Unacceptable in Factor 1, they will not be considered for Phase II.  The Phase II evaluation factor is anticipated to be:  Energy and Sustainable Design.  In making the best value award decision after Phase II, the Government will consider the evaluated ratings for Factors 2 through 5 and price.  The combined non-cost/price factors are approximately equal to price.  
The contract period of performance is anticipated to consist of a one-year base period and four one-year option periods for a total maximum duration of 60 months.
 The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base period and all option periods, for all contracts combined is $240,000,000. The minimum and maximum task order limitation will be established at $3,000,000 to $30,000,000, respectively, and will be competed among the contract awardees. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $10,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee under the performance period of the contract. The minimum guarantee may be met by the issuance of a task order during the base period or option period(s).
  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. There are no additional minimum guarantees obligated for each option year. 

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or around May 2013.  The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov on or about May 2013. No hard copies will be provided.  It is the contractors responsibility to check the websites daily for any amendments to this solicitation.    Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.
 Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the websites listed above. 

The information being requested does not constitute a commitment on the part of the government to award a contract, nor to pay for any costs incurred as a result in replying to this notice. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the government for any purpose.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC), Long Range Enforcer Product Line (LREPL) intends to contract on a sole-source basis with Tognum America to conduct an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) in order to develop plans and methods to facilitate and execute Center Section Overhauls (CSO) of the Main Propulsion Diesel Engine (MPDE), model MTU 20V1163TB93, installed on board USCG 418 foot WMSL class cutters. The USCG intends to evaluate and utilize the provided AOA in order to aid in a best case determination to conduct each CSO in a timely and cost effective manner with the lowest possible risk to operations. MTU Friedrichshafen (MTU), a subsidiary of Tognum AG which is a joint venture of Rolls Royce plc and Daimler AG, is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Tognum America, a subsidiary of Tognum AG, is the sole sales and service representative in the US for this series engine and has access to all proprietary information, design data, technical data, and detailed drawings for these engines. The USCG does not possess all design and technical data regarding these MTU engines which is necessary in order to accomplish this work and cannot provide it to alternate sources to assist them in accomplishing the required task. Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only Tognum, America under the authority of 6.302. It is the belief of the Coast Guard that only Tognum/MTU can perform this work because it alone possesses the required design data, technical data, drawings, and other related proprietary information necessary to successfully perform. The Scope of Work for this effort shall involves three separate phases: Phase 1, Analysis of Alternatives, Phase 2, Detailed Evaluation of Alternatives, Phase 3: Detailed Analysis. <br /><br />This notice is not a request for proposals or an invitation to submit proposals. However, all responses received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Interested parties who believe they are capable of performing this work are invited to submit responses to this notice within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice. Responses must include the following information: (1) Ability to Perform the SOW; (2) Access to required OEM Technical Data including written confirmation from Tognum that tall necessary proprietary information will be made available to the interested party, or a demonstration that the third party already possesses all required proprietary information; (3) Past Performance Information. Interested parties who respond to this notice without providing the information requested will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered for this acquisition. The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this contract. The Government will not compensate potential alternate sources for work necessary to submit the information requested above. For information regarding this acquisition contact the Contracting Officials listed herein.<br />

<DESC><p><strong>VPU REMEDIATION METHODS TESTING <br /></strong></p>
<p>Washington Closure Hanford manages the River Corridor Closure Contract at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site in Southeastern Washington State. The project team is responsible for safely cleaning up and taking down hundreds of excess facilities, cleaning up waste sites, burial grounds and placing deactivated plutonium production reactors in interim safe storage.</p>
<p>One of the methods used for waste disposal at the 618-10 Burial Ground and the 618-11 Burial Ground was the Vertical Pipe Unit (VPU). The first generation (a.k.a., pipe-style) of VPUs was simply pipes, 10- to 12-in diameter and 10- to 15-ft long, buried vertically; the pipes may be corrugated steel culvert or schedule-40 steel pipe. The second generation (a.k.a. drum-style) of VPUs was 22-in diameter, 15-ft long waste receptacles constructed by welding five 55-gallon bottomless drums together end-to-end and burying them vertically, separated by approximately 10 feet on center. The 618-10 and -11 Burial Grounds received low- to high-activity waste (e.g., fission products and some plutonium-contaminated waste). <br /><br />VPU remediation methods testing needs to be accomplished in order to optimize the project's approach to VPU remediation. Elements for testing include:<br /><br />&bull; Augering of pipe-style VPUs for stabilization and size-reduction; both corrugated steel culvert and schedule-40 steel pipe<br />&bull; Injection of water and augmented water via auger to adjust in situ moisture content for dust control<br />&bull; Vertical mixing achieved during augering<br />&bull; Characterization for radiological determination</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />Background<br />The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducts research and provides information on a number of critical issues related to national healthcare research and quality which are of particular interest to government agencies, legislative bodies, health policy makers and other health professionals concerned with health care utilization, patient outcomes, quality, patient safety, expenditures, insurance coverage and components of primary care. The research is primarily based on the annual Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Other research areas include health care quality and patient-based outcomes. Data for these additional analyses are based on a variety of survey data, administrative and medical records, clinical trials data, registry data, pharmaceuticals and prescription drug data, as well as patient-based outcomes and health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) assessment data sets including, but not limited to, the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey (CAHPS), the Medicare and Medicaid administrative, assessment and survey data (e.g., Health Outcomes Survey, Nursing Home Minimum Data Set (MDS), Medicare QIO (formerly known as PRO) data, and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS)), other federal and state government health system and related data (e.g., VA, DoD and HRSA health system data, CDC surveys such as NHIS, NHANES, BRFSS, SLAITS), and commercially available health data (e.g., MEDSTAT Marketscan, state based claims data and NCQA Quality Compass).<br />AHRQ also has a congressional mandate to produce annual reports to the nation on health care quality and disparities in health care. Both of these reports use many of the same databases above to produce their analyses but may utilize other data sources in an effort to provide as comprehensive a picture as possible on these issues to policymakers. Additionally, AHRQ is responsible for implementing the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. In this role, AHRQ has operational responsibilities for implementing and maintaining the Patient Safety Organization (PSO) program, and for developing the Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD). The NPSD will produce analysis reports for the NHQR and NHDR as well as a report to Congress on effective strategies for reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety. <br />Purpose and Objective<br />Please be mindful that while there are IT components in this project, this is NOT an IT requirement. The project will be content-driven, supported by information technology.<br />This potential requirement supports AHRQ's programs by supplying analytic services using the use of statistical software such as SAS and STATA and providing database management services using these same statistical programs. The analytic services requirement includes econometric and behavioral analysis, modeling and microsimulation analysis. While a number of data sources are used, the majority of work involves the use of large complex nationally representative data and surveys. <br />Anticipated activities will include:<br />This requirement includes providing statistical and econometric analysis services for staff research projects involved in healthcare research using a variety of behavioral and econometric analysis. These analytic services will cover a large variety of topics germane to health services research including evaluations of components of the Affordable Care Act. The majority of analytic tasks under this requirement will use two major databases sponsored by the Agency - the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP).<br />The MEPS is an annual longitudinal survey (with an overlapping panel design) of families in the United States that collects information on healthcare use, expense and payment (as well as access to health care, health care quality income and employment). Each year the annual MEPS file (since 1996) includes thousands of variables arranged in more than 50 hierarchical files. The number of observations in each file can range from a few thousand to almost 100,000. Complete documentation about MEPS databases can be accessed at http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/
<p>The HCUP is an ongoing activity that collects hospital discharge abstracts for most hospital inpatient care in the United States. Each year the annual HCUP files (since 1988) include several hundred variables arranged in several linkable files for each database. On average, HCUP produces approximately 200 large, record-level data bases each year; the number of observations in each file can range from several hundred thousand to several million. Complete documentation about HCUP databases can be accessed at http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/<br />In addition to analytic tasks using the MEPS and HCUP, some analytic tasks may also be based on a variety of survey data, administrative and medical records including, clinical trials data, pharmaceuticals and prescription drug data, as well as patient-based outcomes and health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) assessment data sets including, but not limited to, the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey (CAHPS), the Medicare and Medicaid administrative, assessment and survey data (e.g., Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), Home Health Compare, Nursing Home Compare, Hospital Cost data, CMS claims data, CMS Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) data), other federal and state government health system and related data (e.g., Census Bureau data (Current Population Survey (CPS), American Community Survey (ACS)), National Institute of Health (NIH) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) health system data (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER),Area Resource File (ARF), Center of Disease Control surveys such as (National Health Interview Survey) NHIS, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) , Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), and commercially available health data (e.g., Medi-span Master Drug Data Base (MDDB), MarketScan Database and HMO InterStudy Database). <br />This potential requirement will also provide data file development and specifications for the AHRQ Patient Safety Portfolio, specifically for work on the Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD). This requirement will also include the analytic file development and conduct of analyses related to the preparation of the National Healthcare Quality Report (NHQR) and the National Healthcare Disparities Report (NHDR); and for analyses related to the preparation of reports on effective strategies for reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety, and other related tasks.</p>
<p>Additional activities under this potential requirement shall include management and maintenance of MEPS website. The MEPS website is the primary vehicle for releasing the files and analysis developed under this requirement to the public. This requirement also includes the development of web tools for the MEPS website and maintaining the HCUP Querynet tool on the HCUP website. This requirement will also include consultation to AHRQ on security arrangements for confidential data.<br />Project Requirements<br />There are three major tasks for this project, each having specific requirements and deliverables.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:
<p>Solicitation Number: FA8232-13-R-3027</p>
<p>Notice Type: Sources Sought</p>
<p><br />Synopsis:</p>
<p>1. NOTICE: This is not a solicitation, but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336413, which have a corresponding Size standard of 1,000 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran&shy; Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>2. Program Details:</p>
<p>2.1 The following information is provided to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully provide the described capability. AFLCMC/WWMPA F-16 Integration Section, Hill AFB, UT intends to award a 5 year IDIQ contract to manufacture "Flare-Up" kits that will modify existing PIDSU (Pylon Integrated Dispenser System Universal) pylons by angling magazine chambers downward. This is required in order to resolve the potential problem of PIDSU countermeasure projectile contact with the outboard stores and wing. With this modification, the ALM-288 countermeasures and stray voltage tester must also be adapted to fit with the hardware changes to PIDSU. The PIDSU, designed, manufactured and sold to USAF by TERMA, Denmark, is a suspension rack for F-16C/D Blocks 25/30/32 aircraft that can be mounted on either wing. USAF currently owns 310 PIDSU pylons. The ALM-288, sold to USAF by BAE, is the support equipment tester for the PIDSU that simulates the release of countermeasures from the aircraft. With the current PIDSU, the ALM-288 is inserted into one of the three pylon magazine chambers to accomplish testing.</p>
<p>This action is being conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for the following:</p>
<p>a. PIDSU pylons must be able to switch between Flare-Up and standard configurations, providing operational versatility. In some situations, PIDSU pylons without Flare-Up may still be desirable.<br />b. Flare-Up kits must eliminate no more than one-third of PIDSU's countermeasure projectile capacity. <br />c. Flare-Up kits will be transferable between the PIDSUs. There should be no software or hardware updates to the aircraft to utilize Flare-Up.<br />d. The existing ALM-288 must be adapted to the Flare-Up modification.<br />e. The total quantity of Flare-Up kits required by USAF is still being determined.<br />f. EPAF/FMS may decide to participate in the acquisition.<br />g. It is anticipated that the requirement for initial installs will be June 2014.<br />h. The potential source must provide evidence that it is qualified and has obtained all legal rights to modify the PIDSU.</p>
<p>3. This is a request for information seeking sources capable of meeting the requirements in the attached Purchase Description. When responding please include:</p>
<p>a. Company Name, Address, and Cage code.<br />b. Who is your POC? Please provide an email address and phone number.<br />c. Experiences with same or similar items. Please describe.<br />d. Suggested NAICS Code.<br />e. Business Size Classification for NAICS and qualifications if any and any sub-category. <br />f. Would you be a prime or subcontractor?<br />g. Lead Time for the task performance.</p>
<p>4. The points of contact for this notice are:</p>
<p>Brandi Clark<br />Contract Negotiator <br />801-775-5338<br />Brandi.Clark@hill.af.mil</p>
<p>Amanda Holmes<br />Contracting Officer <br />801-777-6878<br />Amanda.Holmes@hill.af.mil</p>
<p>5. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The System Program Office will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this notice. Responses to the notice will not be returned. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>

Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this sources sought does not preclude participation in any future and potential solicitation. It is the intent of the Contracting Office to use this RFI for market research purposes only. If a formal solicitation is released, it will be via the Federal Business <br> Opportunities (https://www.fbo.gov). The Government WILL NOT reimburse costs to any vendor for preparing responses to this RFI. <br>  <br> The McAlester Army Ammunition Plant (MCAAP) was established during WWII and many of the roofs on its buildings date back to 1943.  For example, there are 143 SH warehouses that are 50 ft by 200 ft unreinforced masonry or concrete walls with transite roof panels over wood beam trusses. MCAAP is interested in a cost-effective method for replacing these roofs, including the decking and support.  One issue is whether the trusses can be replaced without substantial reinforcement of the walls. <br>  <br> MCAAP is seeking potential small business sources for a Repair/Replace Roofing requirement. The scope of work will include replacing and/or repairing existing roofs by providing all labor, means, operations, materials, equipment, accessories and incidentals necessary for performing all operations required for the removal and replacement of existing roofs on one hundred forty three (143) facilities at the installation near McAlester, Oklahoma.  The work will include locating and isolating leakage points of entry, removal, repair and replacement of transite roof panels, asphalt shingles, standing seam metal, built-up and/or E.P.D.M. roofing systems, asbestos contained roofing materials, rolled roofing, felt, insulation, <br> plywood decking, roof trusses, roof accessories to include flashing, gravel stops, drip edges, and gutters and downspouts; the application of roof coatings; the repair of joints, recaulking; bat-proofing and incidental related work.  Removal of roofing systems will include, but not be limited to, shingles, underlayment, bituminous membrane, insulation, metal roofing, fascia, soffit, flashing, and wood trim. <br>  <br> The total construction costs for this project is estimated at over $25 million.  <br>  <br> This proposed contract is being considered as a set-aside under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 238160. The size standard for NAICS 238160 is $14,000,000.  <br> Prospective vendors shall have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database, including all active Representations and Certifications.

<DESC>Background: <br> The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Combat Feeding Directorate, is actively researching nanotechnology concepts for enhancing absorption of bioactives and Nutraceuticals when consumed in fortified ration components.   Spray-dried nanoemulsions containing bioactives will also reduce the need for adding excessive concentrations of bioactives [which usually impact flavor and texture] in order to assure adequate absorption.   <br> Requirements:  <br> The NSRDEC is seeking interested vendors to prepare custom tyrosine nanoemulsion powders.   One of the nanotechnology concepts for enhancing absorption is a microfluidized nanoemulsion, which is then spray-dried into a powder.  To achieve our objectives, tyrosine nanoemulsion powder is required; to conduct research to determine properties, evaluate suitability of ration carriers and to conduct a concept field test.   This effort is integrated with strategies to assess performance decrements and their relationship to nutrition. <br> One of the objectives for FY13 is to test selected ration components fortified with nanoemulsion powders.  A concept field test cannot be scheduled until fortified ration components are produced and production of fortified ration components cannot commence until tyrosine nanoemulsion powders are received.  The tyrosine nanoemulsion powders needs to be acquired as soon as possible (NLT 5 Aug 2013) so that ration component production and concept field test can be conducted. <br> The timeframe for period of performance would be approximately 5-10 days.  Nanoemulsion ingredients and protocols would be provided by the government.  Some pre-batch trials with quality control testing would be required by the perspective contractor to assure product meets requirements. <br> Qualifications: <br> Qualified vendors shall be certified to produce food grade materials.  They should have a bench top and food grade pilot plant or an appropriate sized [for trials and production] food grade microfluidizer which meet the following operating requirements; pressure of 25-28K psi, a flow rate of 50-300ml/min, at least a 2 liter product inlet reservoir on pilot plant processor and cooling capacity for producing a nanoemulsion which is stable and with a particle size range of  less than 80 and not greater that 120nm.  Vendor shall have a Malvern Zetasizer nano (or approved equivalent) to measure particle size and to assess stability and maximum tyrosine load.  Nanoemulsions usually require addition of approximately 50% maltodextrin prior to spray drying.  Vendor shall also have a centrifugal spray drier for processing small volumes such as ~2-5 liters, with a feeding rate of 2ml/min and temperature ranges for 155oC at inlet and 60oC at outlet.      Vendor should have past experience working with nanoemulsions and be capable to make equipment adjustments (or other) to meet final product requirements.  Approximately 17-20 Liters of tyrosine nanoemulsion would be required to produce a final ~10,000g batch size of spray dried tyrosine nanoemulsion powder.  <br>  <br> SOURCES SOUGHT:    Interested respondents with the experience and qualifications of assessing quality of nanoemulsions based on stability, particle size and assessing maximum tyrosine load and the  capability to perform the effort specified above are encouraged to respond to this notice.  This is NOT a request for quotes but parties interested in responding are encouraged to furnish in writing, no more than a 2 page (not including cover page) synopsis of their capability to accomplish the described work effort.  Candidates responding to this notice must also provide complete contact information (telephone, address, email address), as well as business size.  Please also include information regarding any prior experience with US Government contracts. <br> The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) for this is notice is 541712, Other Research and Development in Physical Engineering, and Life Sciences (Except Biotechnology) with a size standard of 500 employees.  Interested parties shall indicate their size status based on the size standard of 500 employees.  For any anticipated subcontractors, provide an estimate of the percentage of subcontractor efforts anticipated. <br>  <br> The Government will retain comments and information received in response to this notice. Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary.  Any information provided to the U.S. Government in response to this sources sought notice is for planning purposes only. <br>  <br> Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for any information solicited. No solicitation document exists nor is a solicitation guaranteed to be issued as a result of this notice. <br>  <br> All written responses to this notice must be received by close of business on 24 May 2013.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management and financial capability of such offers to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular, whether a set-aside or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 423830--Industrial Machinery and Equipment (except electrical) Merchant Wholesalers.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 423830 is 100 employees.  
The proposed requirement is for the Service of the Aquafine Ultra-Violet (UV) Light System installed on Hoover Dam's A1 generator cooling water supply.  Service will include parts and provide on-site factory technical support for the Aquafine UV system at Hoover, used to prevent the settlement of bio-fouling quagga mussels in the cooling water system.  Other UV parts are not interchangeable for this piece of equipment.  The UV light system is used for quagga mussel control as a prevention barrier.  UV light damages the quagga mussel DNA and the mussel no longer wants to settle in the cooling water system. Without settlement the blockage caused by bio-fouling does not occur and the generator does not overheat.  Parts needed for service of UV system: four (4) Lamps, six (6) Quartz Sleeves, four (4) Wiper Canister Maintenance, and one (1) UV Sensor Maintenance.  Aquafine UV light system is used at Hoover Dam by the research team conducting quagga mussel control studies.
The anticipated award date will be Friday, May 31, 2013. 
The capability statement shall address the requirement listed above, demonstrate the company's capability to provide the service and parts listed above and describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity.  Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, business size and type (8(a), HubZone, Small Business, etc.), and point of contact, to include e-mail address and telephone number.  Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length.  This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy, in particular, whether an 8(a) or HubZone set-aside is warranted or if another socio-economic set-aside strategy is more appropriate.
Should you be interested in this requirement, please submit a capabilities package to Ms. Jennifer Doran, Contract Specialist, at jdoran@usbr.gov. Statements are to be submitted no later than May 20, 2013 12:00 PM Pacific Standard Time.

<DESC>President Obama has set two ambitious goals: that all adult Americans pursue at least one year of higher education or career training, and that America regain its role as the world leader in college completion.  The Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) discretionary grant program is designed to increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. GEAR UP provides six-year grants to states and partnerships to provide services at high-poverty middle and high schools. State and partnership applicants may also apply for seven years of funding to enable them to provide services to a student through the student's first year of attendance at an institution of higher education.  GEAR UP services include:  (1) Providing information regarding financial aid for postsecondary education to participating students in the cohort; (2) Encouraging student enrollment in rigorous and challenging curricula and coursework; and (3) Improving the number of participating students who obtain a secondary school diploma and complete applications for, and enroll in, a program of postsecondary education.  GEAR UP funds are also used to provide college scholarships to low-income students.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The purpose of this contract is to develop and deliver:<br />&bull;  Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) data framework: This data framework shall provide data definitions and protocols for GEAR UP grantees. The data framework shall provide consistent and uniform data definitions for GEAR UP services and outcome measures comparable across projects and states.    GEAR UP restricted-use data files: These files shall provide accurate and consistent data on at least 50,000 GEAR UP students representing at least 12 GEAR UP state grantees. In addition, the data files shall include appropriate outcome data on non-GEAR UP comparison students. The files shall allow approved researchers (with appropriate licenses to address privacy concerns) to perform analyses, such as rigorous evaluations, in order to better understand GEAR UP implementation and effectiveness. The restricted-use data files shall contain grantee implementation data consistent with the data framework and academic progress indicator data including data on high school achievement and completion, achievement on standardized assessments comparable across states, and postsecondary application, enrollment, persistence, and completion. Compiled data shall allow researchers to address study questions such as:  o  What are the relationships of specific GEAR UP activities relative to key academic progress indicators?   o  What is the relationship of GEAR UP students' academic progress relative to non-GEAR UP students of similar demographic characteristics?   Interested parties are hereby requested to submit capability statements.  Statements shall comply with the attached instructions and be submitted electronically to Sara.Steinberger@ed.gov with a cc to Alice.Mihill@ed.gov no later than 2:00 p.m. ET on May 28, 2013.  In addition, interested parties are requested to provide comments on the draft Performance Work Statement and identify any competition barriers.

<DESC>THE U. S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (NRC) is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis as a means of conducting market research or as a market survey to determine the availability of potential qualified vendors with the technical capability to provide all management, supervision, administration, and labor for the Structural Capacity of Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR) Nuclear Concrete Structures.
<p><br />Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a reaction which can occur over time in concrete between the highly alkaline cement paste and reactive non-crystalline (amorphous) silica, which is found in many common aggregates. This reaction causes the expansion of the altered aggregate by the formation of a swelling gel of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (CSH). This gel increases in volume with water and exerts an expansive pressure inside the material, which may cause spalling and loss of strength of the concrete. The time dependent static and dynamic structural capacity of the ASR affected concrete structure needs to be assessed for making licensing decisions with regards to the safety of ASR affected operating NPP's and for decisions and for the 20 year license renewal of NPP's.</p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify firms capable of conducting technical support activities to develop the technical basis for NRC staff to evaluate the effects of ASR on the structural capacities of concrete structures as a function of time. The focus of the study shall be the assessment of the structural performance of ASR affected concrete structures subject to design basis static and dynamic loading and load combinations through its service life, including the period of extended operation for the 20-year license renewal period. Evaluation of the chemical degradation of the concrete structures (ASR) as a function of time (and associated concrete properties deterioration) must be an integral component of the structural assessment. Assessing the structural performance of the reinforced concrete element exhibiting distress due to ASR is an important component of a structural management plan. Furthermore, an aging management plan that includes a revised schedule for inspection and evaluation for affected concrete will require understanding the rate of the ASR degradation. The study should focus on developing the technical bases for estimating the current and future structural properties of the concrete structure, and techniques for detecting, identifying and monitoring of ASR affected structures.<br /><br />Specific activities concerning the technical support activities, priority and technical capabilities that will be provided to the NRC include:</p>
<p>1. Identifying and evaluating methods for managing the effects of ASR to maintain intended functionality of the concrete structures,<br />2. Identifying criteria to assess the state of the ASR with respect to structural performance,<br />3. Identifying and evaluating methods for determining the state and severity of the ASR degradation, and for predicting the rate at which the reaction is progressing,<br />4. Identifying the effects of ASR on the capacity of anchorages,<br />5. Identifying and evaluating methods for determining the impact of ASR on the mechanical properties of reinforced concrete as they relate to the static and dynamic performance,<br />6. Identifying parameters to be measured and the criteria to be used to determine when the ACI 349 code provisions and other related standards and codes may not be valid,<br />7. Identifying data needed to develop reliable numerical models for the formation of ASR and for evaluating the performance of ASR-affected concrete,<br />8. Quantifying the change in transport processes through ASR-affected concrete and identifying how it may affect other degradation mechanisms such as corrosion of the steel reinforcement,<br />9. Identifying standard test methods for new construction that may improve the effectiveness of reducing the likelihood of ASR for new structures, and <br />10. Developing numerical models of the static and dynamic performance of ASR affected concrete and models to predict ASR reaction in concrete structures, as a function of time.</p>
<p>The NRC estimates that three or more principal engineers/scientists will be required to support this effort on a full time basis for 3 years. The principal engineers/scientists must have several years of experience in the design, construction, testing, inspection and aging management of concrete structures and cementitious materials behavior including testing, analyses, multiple component modeling of degradation processes, and service life prediction of concrete structures. The principal engineers/scientists must also have strong backgrounds in typical nuclear industry practices for maintenance, testing, codes and practices and familiarity with NRC licensing and inspection processes. The performing organization should have experimental facilities for large scale testing of concrete specimens, and a concrete materials laboratory for microstructural testing of cementitious samples, cements, aggregates and reinforcing steel.</p>
<p>Services are to be provided to the NRC in Rockville, Maryland. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541712.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for sources and vendor information does not constitute a request for proposal; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>
<p><br />REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:</p>

The Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 541380 with a Small Business Size Standard $14.0 M for an upcoming requirement for the National Water Quality Laboratory, in Denver, CO to provide analysis of water, sediment, and other materials for C-14 dating by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS).
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR.  Submission is voluntary. 
This requirement is for C-14 dating of waters and solid material.  These solid materials are to include (but not be limited to) rock carbonate as well as organic carbon in solid samples. Analysis is also to include C-13 which shall be reported with the C-14.  Some samples may contain H2S and/or be from areas of hydrofracking or oil exploration.  These samples may require specialized clean up prior to analysis. Reporting-- The C-14 shall be reported according to recommendations of Stuiver and Polach, specifically the values of delta C-14 (in per mil), percent modern carbon relative to the NBS I oxalic acid standard, normalized for C-13 fractionation, and corrected for decay since 1950 (pM), and Conventional Radiocarbon Age (5568 year half-life), in years before 1950.  In addition, the contract lab shall report percent modern carbon (pMC) relative to the NBS I oxalic acid standard, corrected for decay since The C-13 shall be reported in per mil relative to VPDB, such that the value of NBS 19 carbonate is + 1.95 per mil. Precision and uncertainty The C-14 shall be accompanied by a one-sigma error value, in +/-per mil for delta carbon, in +/- percent for values in pMC, and +/- years for the Conventional Radiocarbon Age.  Reporting precision (as +/- sigma) shall vary with C-14 activity of the sample.  As a guide, for samples containing less than 1 percent Modern, C-14 shall be reported with an uncertainty of generally less than 10 percent of the reported value.  Values in the range of 1-5 pMC shall have a one-sigma uncertainty of generally less than 3% of the reported value.  For values in the range of 5-10 pMC, the reported uncertainty shall be generally less than 2% of the reported value.  For values greater than 10 pMC, the reported uncertainty shall be generally equal to or less than 1% of the reported value. The C-13 shall be reported with a one sigma uncertainty of +/- 0.3 per mil. Reports are to consist of a full data electronic spreadsheet as well as an Electronic Data Deliverable (EDD) Internal Quality Control The contractor shall analyze a blank, a laboratory control sample, and a C-13 duplicate with every analytical batch of 15 samples.  These QC results are to be reported with the sample results.  No subcontracting of analytical work shall be allowed under this contract.

Only HUBZone businesses are encouraged to respond.  When responding, please submit capability statements by 16 May 2013. <br>  <br> Tele-Health is headquartered at Fort Belvoir, VA, but the positions will be filled throughout all of the Northern Regional Medical Command (NRMC) Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  <br>  <br> This contract will support NRMC Headquarters as well as all of the following MTF sites: <br>  <br> Fort Bragg, NCAberdeen Proving Grounds, MDFort Meade, MDFort Myer, VAFort Knox, KYFort Detrick, MDFort Lee, VA Fort Drum, NY Fort Eustis, VAFort Dix, NJWest Point, NYCamp Atterbury, IN <br> The following are the primary objectives for the Tele-Health program:  <br>  <br> * The Tele-Health MTF (THMTF) is an approach to providing comprehensive specialty care for all beneficiaries.  THMTF is a healthcare setting that facilitates partnerships between individual patients and their primary care teams and specialty care regardless of location, type of service, and healthcare setting.  One of the fundamental principles of a THMTF organization is to coordinate and/or integrate care across all elements of a complex health care system.  Subspecialty care has been historically difficult to integrate into a primary care setting.  Lack of coordination and ineffective communication can lead to patient safety concerns (e.g., conflicting medications), increased cost for duplication of services, and fragmented treatment for the management of chronic diseases.  One solution is to provide subspecialty care directly into the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) through the use of Tele-Health.  Up to now, Tele-Health as a treatment modality has also been very fragmented and has been a collection of pilot projects, stovepipe initiatives, and has been randomly applied.  The purpose of this concept of operations (CONOPS) is to standardize a fully integrated Tele-Health facility with multiple programs into the PCMH leveraging across all product lines in order to provide a cost-efficient mechanism to bring both the hard to manage and healthy patients continuity of care with medical and nonmedical state-of-the-art interventions from the acute to long-term settings.   <br>  <br> * Contractor Personnel.  The HCPs shall be used as the primary source of health care delivery for the Tele-Health organization.  Health care services are considered personal health care services for all professional contract providers, i.e., Physician Assistants, Medical Support Assistants (MSAs), License Practical Nurses (LPNs), Healthcare Administrators, Social Workers, Registered Nurse Supervisors, Registered Nurses, and Program Managers.  <br>  <br> * The delivery of Tele-Health care includes a full range of clinical, wellness, administrative, and educational services that are relevant to the diagnosis, treatment, and management of all applicable services.  This system leverages state-of-the-art technology to extend the availability and accessibility of a number of medical disciplines throughout the AMEDD as required.  The applicable programs that can support both the PCMH and other MTFs include, but are not limited to: <br>  <br> * Behavioral Health <br> * Cardiology <br> * Dermatology <br> * Diabetic Retinopathy <br> * Neurology <br> * Surgical Subspecialties  <br> * Nutrition Care <br> * Pain Management <br> * Pharmacy <br> * Wellness <br>  <br> * The mission of a THMTF is to maximize the existing Tele-Health resources to support a PCMH mission or to provide direct support to other DoD MTFs.  Resources can be leveraged within and across DoD Services or their functional components to avoid duplication of effort, especially in the less utilized specialties (i.e., Neurosurgery).  The establishment of a formal MTF specifically for the purpose of providing Tele-Health services will serve a number of critical needs currently faced by the Military Healthcare System (MHS).  Providing long-term growth and stability of service lines under the THMTF will require the establishment of a Defense Medical Information System (DMIS) Identifier.  This will provide for stable funding, proper utilization of resources, and standardization of services.   <br>  <br> * A comprehensive and integrated THMTF and system of care where specialty care and primary care providers interact systematically to meet the health needs of their patients through collaborative development of treatment plans, provision of clinical services, and coordination of care through the use of technology.  <br>  <br> Key Tasks <br>  <br> * Full integration of Tele-Health assets into the PCMH and initially NRMC MTFs as required by individual facilities. This will require continued research and program evaluation to develop and implement best practices. Once established, the scope and reach of this facility will expand to any and all appropriate MHS facilities. <br>  <br> * Develop a standardized way of accessing Tele-Health services across the enterprise.  The need for a global scheduling system is inherent in leveraging Tele-Health resources across all active institutions. <br>  <br> * Standardize the operational elements of all product lines across the enterprise while giving the supported elements the ability to adjust program specifics to meet the need of their respective MTFs. Coordinate with the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health & Traumatic Brain Injury (DcoE) on best practices. <br>  <br> * Integration of wellness initiatives into the PCMH via the use of Tele-Health. <br>  <br> * Develop mobile applications, in home care, and utilize other platforms to meet the needs of DoD Beneficiaries in the  quote mark White Space quote mark . <br>  <br> * Identify current Information Technology/Information Management assets, requirements, and forecast what would be required at end state.  The costs of expanding the current infrastructure will need to be outlined in a Program Objective Memorandum (POM) for development of future sustainment funding/budgets, life cycle replenishment of technology, and targeted future Tele-Health transformations. <br>  <br> * Identify space requirements for the THMTF and space requirements for each supported facility.  Clinical space at supported sites may need to be altered to accommodate for the TH service delivery and/or mobile solutions may be required to maximize limited space at many existing facilities. <br>  <br> * Develop a core budget that covers all components of the various service product lines. <br>  <br> * Adjust business rules to account for resources not traditionally assigned to a single facility.  With the implementation of the STEP Act, providers and patients will not be confined to traditional healthcare locations. <br>  <br> * The contractor shall provide medical services at multiple sites as designated by the NRMC.  In addition to the multiple site changes, the contractor shall be required to accommodate changes in the required hours of operation which shall also change from day-to-day.  The Government will notify the contractor of such changes a minimum of 12 hours in advance.  In all instances, supervision of the HCPs shall be provided by the department chief, the clinic chief or an authorized designee of the WAMC or of the duty site designated within the NRMC region. <br>  <br> * In the event the contract is terminated, the HCPs shall be covered for any malpractice claims or lawsuits that may arise in the future if the care provided was rendered to the Claimant under the terms of the Contract. <br>  <br> * In the event of litigation/investigation of a claim of liability or malpractice, the HCPs shall cooperate fully with Government authorities and designated officials in the investigation of the claim or preparation of litigation.  The HCPs shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and promptly furnish copies of all pertinent papers received; cooperate with the Government in the processing, review, settlement or defense of the suit, action or claim; and authorize Government representatives to settle or defend the claims and to represent the health care provider in, or take charge of, any litigation involved in such an action. <br>  <br> The primary objective for this procurement is to maximize the existing Tele-Health resources to support a PCMH mission or to provide direct support to other DoD MTFs.  Resources can be leveraged within and across DoD Services or their functional components to avoid duplication of effort, especially in the less utilized specialties (i.e., Neurosurgery).  This performance of healthcare services by the individual contract health care providers under a personal services contract are subject to day-to-day supervision, clinical oversight and control by healthcare facility personnel comparable to that exercised over military and civil service health care providers engaged in comparable healthcare services <br>  <br> After results of this market research are obtained NRCO may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Contract.  If at least two responsible, qualified respondents are classified as HUBZone certified described herein, then any competitive procurement solicited by NARCO will be done as a HUBZone set-aside. <br>  <br> Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 621999, as those domestic sources having $14 million or less.  Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.  If you believe there is a more suitable NAICS code that should be used, please let us know within your correspondence.    <br>  <br> HUBZone Companies that can provide the health care and ancillary services for the Tele-Health Department for Headquarters, NRMC, sites are requested to email a detailed capabilities package describing their abilities to Debra.J.Parker@us.army.mil no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.

Only HUBZone businesses are encouraged to respond.  When responding, please submit capability statements by 16 May 2013. <br>  <br> Tele-Health is headquartered at Fort Belvoir, VA, but the positions will be filled throughout all of the Northern Regional Medical Command (NRMC) Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  <br>  <br> This contract will support NRMC Headquarters as well as all of the following MTF sites: <br>  <br> Fort Bragg, NCAberdeen Proving Grounds, MDFort Meade, MDFort Myer, VAFort Knox, KYFort Detrick, MDFort Lee, VA Fort Drum, NY Fort Eustis, VAFort Dix, NJWest Point, NYCamp Atterbury, IN <br> The following are the primary objectives for the Tele-Health program:  <br>  <br> * The Tele-Health MTF (THMTF) is an approach to providing comprehensive specialty care for all beneficiaries.  THMTF is a healthcare setting that facilitates partnerships between individual patients and their primary care teams and specialty care regardless of location, type of service, and healthcare setting.  One of the fundamental principles of a THMTF organization is to coordinate and/or integrate care across all elements of a complex health care system.  Subspecialty care has been historically difficult to integrate into a primary care setting.  Lack of coordination and ineffective communication can lead to patient safety concerns (e.g., conflicting medications), increased cost for duplication of services, and fragmented treatment for the management of chronic diseases.  One solution is to provide subspecialty care directly into the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) through the use of Tele-Health.  Up to now, Tele-Health as a treatment modality has also been very fragmented and has been a collection of pilot projects, stovepipe initiatives, and has been randomly applied.  The purpose of this concept of operations (CONOPS) is to standardize a fully integrated Tele-Health facility with multiple programs into the PCMH leveraging across all product lines in order to provide a cost-efficient mechanism to bring both the hard to manage and healthy patients continuity of care with medical and nonmedical state-of-the-art interventions from the acute to long-term settings.   <br>  <br> * Contractor Personnel.  The HCPs shall be used as the primary source of health care delivery for the Tele-Health organization.  Health care services are considered personal health care services for all professional contract providers, i.e., Physician Assistants, Medical Support Assistants (MSAs), License Practical Nurses (LPNs), Healthcare Administrators, Social Workers, Registered Nurse Supervisors, Registered Nurses, and Program Managers.  <br>  <br> * The delivery of Tele-Health care includes a full range of clinical, wellness, administrative, and educational services that are relevant to the diagnosis, treatment, and management of all applicable services.  This system leverages state-of-the-art technology to extend the availability and accessibility of a number of medical disciplines throughout the AMEDD as required.  The applicable programs that can support both the PCMH and other MTFs include, but are not limited to: <br>  <br> * Behavioral Health <br> * Cardiology <br> * Dermatology <br> * Diabetic Retinopathy <br> * Neurology <br> * Surgical Subspecialties  <br> * Nutrition Care <br> * Pain Management <br> * Pharmacy <br> * Wellness <br>  <br> * The mission of a THMTF is to maximize the existing Tele-Health resources to support a PCMH mission or to provide direct support to other DoD MTFs.  Resources can be leveraged within and across DoD Services or their functional components to avoid duplication of effort, especially in the less utilized specialties (i.e., Neurosurgery).  The establishment of a formal MTF specifically for the purpose of providing Tele-Health services will serve a number of critical needs currently faced by the Military Healthcare System (MHS).  Providing long-term growth and stability of service lines under the THMTF will require the establishment of a Defense Medical Information System (DMIS) Identifier.  This will provide for stable funding, proper utilization of resources, and standardization of services.   <br>  <br> * A comprehensive and integrated THMTF and system of care where specialty care and primary care providers interact systematically to meet the health needs of their patients through collaborative development of treatment plans, provision of clinical services, and coordination of care through the use of technology.  <br>  <br> Key Tasks <br>  <br> * Full integration of Tele-Health assets into the PCMH and initially NRMC MTFs as required by individual facilities. This will require continued research and program evaluation to develop and implement best practices. Once established, the scope and reach of this facility will expand to any and all appropriate MHS facilities. <br>  <br> * Develop a standardized way of accessing Tele-Health services across the enterprise.  The need for a global scheduling system is inherent in leveraging Tele-Health resources across all active institutions. <br>  <br> * Standardize the operational elements of all product lines across the enterprise while giving the supported elements the ability to adjust program specifics to meet the need of their respective MTFs. Coordinate with the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health & Traumatic Brain Injury (DcoE) on best practices. <br>  <br> * Integration of wellness initiatives into the PCMH via the use of Tele-Health. <br>  <br> * Develop mobile applications, in home care, and utilize other platforms to meet the needs of DoD Beneficiaries in the  quote mark White Space quote mark . <br>  <br> * Identify current Information Technology/Information Management assets, requirements, and forecast what would be required at end state.  The costs of expanding the current infrastructure will need to be outlined in a Program Objective Memorandum (POM) for development of future sustainment funding/budgets, life cycle replenishment of technology, and targeted future Tele-Health transformations. <br>  <br> * Identify space requirements for the THMTF and space requirements for each supported facility.  Clinical space at supported sites may need to be altered to accommodate for the TH service delivery and/or mobile solutions may be required to maximize limited space at many existing facilities. <br>  <br> * Develop a core budget that covers all components of the various service product lines. <br>  <br> * Adjust business rules to account for resources not traditionally assigned to a single facility.  With the implementation of the STEP Act, providers and patients will not be confined to traditional healthcare locations. <br>  <br> * The contractor shall provide medical services at multiple sites as designated by the NRMC.  In addition to the multiple site changes, the contractor shall be required to accommodate changes in the required hours of operation which shall also change from day-to-day.  The Government will notify the contractor of such changes a minimum of 12 hours in advance.  In all instances, supervision of the HCPs shall be provided by the department chief, the clinic chief or an authorized designee of the WAMC or of the duty site designated within the NRMC region. <br>  <br> * In the event the contract is terminated, the HCPs shall be covered for any malpractice claims or lawsuits that may arise in the future if the care provided was rendered to the Claimant under the terms of the Contract. <br>  <br> * In the event of litigation/investigation of a claim of liability or malpractice, the HCPs shall cooperate fully with Government authorities and designated officials in the investigation of the claim or preparation of litigation.  The HCPs shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and promptly furnish copies of all pertinent papers received; cooperate with the Government in the processing, review, settlement or defense of the suit, action or claim; and authorize Government representatives to settle or defend the claims and to represent the health care provider in, or take charge of, any litigation involved in such an action. <br>  <br> The primary objective for this procurement is to maximize the existing Tele-Health resources to support a PCMH mission or to provide direct support to other DoD MTFs.  Resources can be leveraged within and across DoD Services or their functional components to avoid duplication of effort, especially in the less utilized specialties (i.e., Neurosurgery).  This performance of healthcare services by the individual contract health care providers under a personal services contract are subject to day-to-day supervision, clinical oversight and control by healthcare facility personnel comparable to that exercised over military and civil service health care providers engaged in comparable healthcare services <br>  <br> After results of this market research are obtained NRCO may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Contract.  If at least two responsible, qualified respondents are classified as HUBZone certified described herein, then any competitive procurement solicited by NARCO will be done as a HUBZone set-aside. <br>  <br> Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 621999, as those domestic sources having $14 million or less.  Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.  If you believe there is a more suitable NAICS code that should be used, please let us know within your correspondence.    <br>  <br> HUBZone Companies that can provide the health care and ancillary services for the Tele-Health Department for Headquarters, NRMC, sites are requested to email a detailed capabilities package describing their abilities to Debra.J.Parker@us.army.mil no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  It is NOT a solicitation for proposals.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this notice, and will NOT reimburse any cost incurred in response to this notice.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 621498 with a size standard of $10.0 million (USD).

This sources sought notice is being issued to determine if there are small businesses capable of, and interested in, providing the required services.  Responses from interested, capable and experienced small business firms will assist the VA in making a set-aside decision for this procurement.  Relevant experience would be a project where the company BOTH established and operated a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) for primary care and mental health services.  Payments under the contemplated contract would be made on a capitated-rate basis.  The company awarded the contract will be required to have a fully operation clinic up and running on or before the 90th day after award.  

Set-up activities include, but are not limited to: 
1) leasing adequate space
2) furnishing the space with adequate office furniture
3) equipping the space with adequate office, computer and medical equipment
4) furnishing health care providers (other than physicians and psychologists) with the requisite licenses, credentials, certifications, and other support staff to run the clinic
5) working with the VA to connect to the VA computer network
6) ensuring that the clinic will be compliant with all relevant VA and JCAHO regulations from the first day of operation

Operational activities include, but are not limited to, handling all operational activities of a primary care and mental health clinic, and using the VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to enter all information related to patient care.  The contractor would provide primary care and mental health services in a clinic environment, solely to veterans who primarily reside in Lincoln County & Tillamook County, OR.  The current clinic located in Newport, OR has 1,400 enrolled patients, and there are currently 165 patients on the wait list to join the facility.

The contractor operated CBOC must have the necessary facilities, professional medical staff, diagnostic testing and treatment capability, and referral arrangements needed to ensure continuity of health care.  All services at the clinic to be performed by physicians and psychologists will be performed by VA staff.  All other clinic staff (e.g, Registered Nurses, Medical Support Assistants, Licensed Practical Nurses, Health Technicians, etc.) will be provided by the contractor.  Primary Care services include longitudinal outpatient medical care for the purposes of prevention and detection of disease and subsequent management of medical conditions, for veterans deemed eligible.  The contractor will also be responsible for documenting care provided using CPRS.  The proposed CBOC, at a minimum, shall provide one standard of care that must be consistent, safe and of high quality.  Additionally, the proposed CBOC is expected to comply with all relevant VA policies and procedures, including those related to quality, patient safety and performance.  The care provided by the CBOC should be patient centered, continuous, accessible, coordinated, and consistent with VA Medical Center standards, including the thirteen service standards detailed in VHA Directive 2006-041, "Veterans Health Care Service Standards," dated 6/27/06 (http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=1443).  Finally, the VA Office of Patient Care Services, Primary Care Program Office, is undertaking a new initiative to implement a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model at all Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Primary Care sites which is referred to as Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT).  This initiative supports the VHA Universal Health Care Services Plan to redesign VHA healthcare delivery through increasing access, coordination, communication, and continuity of care.  PACT provides accessible, coordinated, comprehensive, patient-centered care, and is managed by primary care providers with the active involvement of other clinical and non-clinical staff.  PACT allows patients to have a more active role in their health care and is associated with increased quality improvement, patient satisfaction, and a decrease in hospital costs due to fewer hospital visits and readmissions.  Additional information on PACT can be found here: http://www.va.gov/primarycare/pcmh/).

Interested parties shall respond to this Sources Sought Notice no later than close of business on May 21, 2013, and shall provide the following information:

1) Name of business and company contact information
2) DUNS number
3) Description of specific projects where your firm BOTH established and operated a primary care outpatient clinic in the United States.  Only list those projects where your firm handled BOTH the establishment and the operation of the clinic.  List the dates of operation for each project that meets BOTH criteria. 
4) PROVIDE REFERENCES FOR PROJECTS WHERE YOUR FIRM HAS BOTH ESTABLISHED AND OPERATED A PRIMARY CARE CLINIC. 

If a formal solicitation is issued, it is anticipated that the award date of any resultant contract would be in the first quarter of 2014.  The contract period of performance would consist of a one-year base period, and four 1-year option periods.

BACKGROUND
The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is to provide benefits and services to Veterans of the United States.  In meeting these goals, VA strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient Information Technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout all the points of the Veterans' health care in an effective, timely and compassionate manner.  VA depends on Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals.

The goal of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), which includes the Center for Veteran Enterprise, is to help small and Veteran-owned businesses contribute most effectively to the important mission of VA.  OSDBU seeks to enable Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HUB Zone Businesses, and Woman Owned Small Businesses to add value to the work of VA.  OSDBU provides outreach and liaison support to business (small and large) and other members of the public and private sectors concerning small business acquisition issues.  OSDBU is responsible for monitoring VA implementation and execution of the socioeconomic programs.

VetGovPartner (VGP) is a VA OSDBU-sponsored matchmaking portal and social network designed to facilitate partnering and networking among small businesses, large businesses, and Government partners.  In order for the VGP platform to continue to add value to VA OSDBU, the system requires operations and maintenance (O&M) support, including hosting.  The VGP platform has evolved from a networking roundtable (matchmaking) session management (VGP1) tool into a national-event level management and market researching platform (VGP2).  This system connects acquisition-focused people and VA OSDBU event attendees together to collaborate, perform market research, network, and manage attendance logistics.

<SUBJECT>EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF OVERSEAS PRE-POSITIONED FOOD AID COMMODITIES AND WAREHOUSING
<SOLNBR>TRN-13-034-RFI
<RESPDATE>052413
<CONTACT>John J. Abood, Acting Division Chief, Phone 202-567-4641, Email jabood@usaid.gov - Paul Vicinanzo, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-712-5147, Email PVicinanzo@usaid.gov
<DESC>MAY 14, 2013
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:<br />EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF OVERSEAS PRE-POSITIONED FOOD AID COMMODITIES AND WAREHOUSING</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) and Market Survey is to gather information from qualified organizations which are able to show a demonstrated capability to provide quantitative evaluation and analysis services.  These services including, but are not limited to, impact and performance evaluations, qualitative research, surveys and data collection, cost analysis, effectiveness, and feasibility studies.  Your responses to this RFI will partially inform the design of the potential evaluative services sought by USAID.  This is a request for information only and your response will not be considered an offer or proposal to the government.  This request for information does not commit the government to pay any costs or expenses incurred during your preparation or submission of a response to this RFI, or to contract for services.</p>
<p>USAID/M/OAA/T requests information about the capability of a contractor to conduct<br />a study of the effectiveness and efficiency of USAID's Food For Peace pre-positioning of emergency food aid in overseas locations.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Food for Peace global food aid commodity pre-positioning warehouse program is to decrease the response time for the delivery of emergency food aid commodities to areas requiring food aid.  Traditionally, USAID procured food aid products only after an immediate requirement was identified, resulting in food shipments taking 4 to 6 months to reach the recipient populations.  USAID/ FFP currently operates five overseas pre-position warehouses and a domestic warehouse, enabling the program to advance purchase and pre-position up to 100,000 metric tons of food in strategic locations around the world.  The pre-position warehouses decrease the delivery time of USAID/ FFP responses to emergencies.</p>
<p>Focus of the Study:  Conduct research and analysis, and document an evaluation of the effectiveness of the USAID food aid pre-position program.  This will include an analysis of the flexibilities offered by operating a food aid supply chain which includes the pre-positioning of commodities in strategic locations around the world.  Analyze and evaluate the differences, in effectiveness and efficiency (costs and timeliness), between a food aid program supply chain with and without a pre-positioning mechanism.</p>
<p>Conduct an analysis of ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the USAID/ FFP overseas prepositioning program, including an analysis of the use of timely commodity purchases, inventory turnover schedules and ocean vessel/freight diversion decisions.</p>
<p>The government anticipates the study will require one individual utilizing one month of effort.</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to provide the following information.  In order to be responsive the entity must: <br />1.  Be an individual citizen, or an organization, that meets the source and nationality requirements of USAID Geographic code 000.<br />2.  Be majority owned by individuals who are citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States or be managed by a governing body, the majority of whom are citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States.</p>
<p>3. Provide a written response to the following questions:</p>
<p>&#9679; How many evaluations of a similar type has the individual or organization performed over the last 3 years?  Please provide example titles and summaries, or links to documents.   Clearly describe which evaluations were conducted by you or your firm, and which were only supported by the organization. <br />&#9679; What was the scope of the evaluations (time frame, dollar amount)? <br />&#9679;  Please provide past performance information for you or your organization, which demonstrates your experience in managing and implementing these or similar analysis and evaluative services. Please include past performance information about two (2) or more activities, including final evaluation reports (if relevant), for services that were performed by your organization. <br />State your business size (small or large) with regard to the government small business size standards for this type of report.</p>
<p>Provide any other pertinent information regarding how you or your organization, as the contractor, will approach this analysis.</p>
<p>Your responses will be treated as "confidential" and will not be shared outside the U.S. Government.  Responses shall be no longer than three pages in length.</p>
<p>Disclaimer <br />This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government to issue any solicitation or ultimately award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. It should be noted that responding to this RFI will not give any advantage to any organization in any subsequent procurements.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ) Picatinny Arsenal, has a requirement from the PD TMDE to provide the Next Generation Automatic Test System (NGATS). <br>  <br> NGATS is the latest addition to the Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE) developed and managed by the PD TMDE.  NGATS is a reconfigurable, general-purpose, mobile, deployable, Automatic Test System (ATS) designed to provide off-platform sustainment support to all Army weapon systems.  This flexible testing platform will provide diagnostic maintenance of Current and Future Force electronic systems and will standardize the Army's Automatic Test Equipment (ATE).  NGATS tests Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs) by isolating failures to the component level.  Current ATS in the Army inventory, such as the IFTE Base Shop Test Facility (BSTF) V3/V5 and the Direct Support Electrical System Test Set (DSESTS), are experiencing sustainment and obsolescence issues.  NGATS is the answer to filling these needs. <br>  <br> In accordance with Statement of Work (SOW), the contractor will produce and support the NGATS Console, perform final integration and verification of the NGATS console into the Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) shelter, and provide engineering services.  Expected products from this effort will be complete production quality NGATS consoles, integration of a subset of the consoles into government provided shelters in accordance with the CLIN structure, a complete technical data package suitable for re-competition efforts, documentation required to maintain the system, logistics support plans and data, a complete set of technical manuals, and all software source code. <br>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Applied Energy Systems, Inc of Malvern, PA for the acquisition of two replacement Control Panels for the Dichlorosilane Gas Cabinet to be used in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) NanoFab Facility at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.
<p>The Center of Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is a multi-user facility that provides hands-on access to state-of-the-art Nanofabrication equipment and processes to researchers of all levels of knowledge from novice to expert and from both inside and outside NIST. The tools within the facility are used by the researchers on a pay-by-use basis.</p>
<p>Sole source determination is based on the urgent need to replace two (2) Control Panels for the existing Dichlorosilane Gas Cabinet. The display and its software, control all of the safety operations and valve sequences to provide dichlorosilane gas delivery to a variety of tools in the NanoFab cleanroom. The current display has completely failed and no longer responds to any commands leaving the gas cabinet shutdown with no means to deliver the dichlorosilane gas to the cleanroom tools. The dichlorosilane gas is a required component for several standard nanofabrication processes. Multiple NIST and external projects rely on the gases on a daily basis. The loss of the this capability is having a significant impact on the continuation of projects.</p>
<p>The display controller that has failed has proprietary software to safely monitor, execute purge commands, and maintain gas flow. Only Applied Energy Systems control panels are 100 percent compatible with the existing system. No other manufacturer or distributor is capable of providing the required control panels.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for future use. All inquiries must be received by May 24, 2013.</p>

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:  Knowledge Facilitation Project
<SOLNBR>NB620000-13-02750
<RESPDATE>052813
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Todd D Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Prometheus Computing, LLC, of Cullowhee North Carolina for Knowledge Facilitation Project IT Technical Enhancements under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(b)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p><br />The major phases of the Knowledge Facilitation Project have been completed and the maintenance phase will be transitioned in-house to the Government in October to maintain the project and provide limited updates as needed. While the Government has personnel with the requisite capabilities to perform the maintenance, they must first be trained on the architecture of this very complex program. The current (and last) task order includes a set of high-priority subtasks, and was not originally envisioned as the final task order, so it does not include subtasks for final debugging of code developed under this task order or subtasks for training and transition to another programmer. Therefore, a three-month extension is urgently required to close-out this task order and transition the project in-house.</p>
<p>Because of the very specific nature of this database project, and its development by Prometheus Computing programmers working closely with NIST customers, there is not a practical alternative to closing out this project other than the required extension. Given the expected availability of IT resources in-house, and the limited work remaining to be done, it would not be cost effective to the federal government to conduct a new solicitation for contract support. Because the close-out requires intimate knowledge and understanding of the project and underlying code, it is not possible to use another vendor to complete these tasks.</p>
<p>The CNST project management system developed under this task order is now in daily use and a mission-critical system for daily operation of a national nanotechnology user facility supporting over 1600 researchers participating in over 400 projects per year (all managed through this system). It is essential that NIST be able to debug, maintain, and continue to add features to this system. Failure to execute this extension would cause an unacceptable delay in the CNST's ability to manage projects and report metrics as required to the DOC.</p>
<p>The IDIQ (SB1341-09-CQ-0044) from which the original task order (12-402) was awarded was competed via full and open competition in 2009.</p>
<p><br />Prometheus Computing is the only contractor who can provide the Knowledge Facilitation Project IT Technical Enhancements services that meet NIST's requirements. Therefore, the Prometheus Computing is uniquely qualified to provide the required services.</p>
<p>The effort will be completed no later than December 31, 2013.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541690, and the size standard is $14.0M.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (Eastern) on May 28, 2013. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>1. DISCLAIMER a. This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) for the purpose of determining market capability of sources or obtaining information. It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services discussed in this notice. Information on the specific topics of interest is provided in the following sections of this announcement. b. This is a Request for Information only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.0002 and 15.201(e).  The Government does not anticipate any contract will be awarded from this announcement, and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI.  As such, this RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute any obligation on the part of the US Navy. c. Responding to this RFI is not prerequisite to participation in any future RFP or solicitation, should one be issued.  All submissions will become US Navy property and will not be returned.  All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.   2. BACKGROUND a. Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information from industry regarding the ability to provide wired and wireless IT equipment on behalf of the Department of the Navy. Equipment includes all Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) wired and wireless equipment as well as end user devices such as WiFi access points, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) equipment, biometric equipment, wireless telephony, mesh radio equipment, wireless alarm and sensor equipment, wireless medical reporting equipment, wireless camera equipment, and IP television equipment. b. The current state of afloat wired and wireless communications can best be described as a Segmented or stove-piped state, as each mode of communications (such as Private Branch Exchange (PBX),  Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) services, Land Mobile Radio (LMR) equipment, Wireless phones, etc.) utilize their own cable distribution and antenna infrastructures.  In turn, they perform in an isolated or unaware state from the rest of the wired and wireless end-points.  Such a condition can become a restrictive element for growth, scale, and innovations in ship-wide communications. The implementation of a common infrastructure could effectively begin to move the communications infrastructure from Segmented to Integrated and allow ships to consider other added value technologies that may become applicable due to the unification of traditionally segmented communications technologies. c. Leveraging a common  infrastructure is a foundational step in the creation of a long term shipboard communications roadmap that considers future conditions.  Understanding that the latest generation of shipboard personnel is reporting to ships with an established culture for information sharing, collaboration and continuous connectivity, it is critical to create a next generation technology roadmap that utilizes a common infrastructure; therefore harnessing this potential. To prove that a common infrastructure can meet shipboard requirements, SSC Pacific has created an innovation lab in which we have developed the Common Optical Distribution Architecture (CODA) in order to successfully execute a proof of concept. d. To perform a successful proof of concept, SSC Pacific will utilize the innovation lab to provide the backbone infrastructure for commercially available communications technology. The infrastructure serves two purposes; it demonstrates a single infrastructure that will accommodate the latest in wired and wireless technology. It also provides a platform in which various technologies can be showcased and demonstrated (such as an RFID system monitoring personnel within the innovation center). The innovation lab is looking for COTS equipment that can be easily integrated on an Ethernet Network. e. Based on the information received, the Government may issue Bailment Agreements to receive certain technologies for development and testing at various facilities.  3. SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUESTED             a.          The intent of this RFI is to obtain information regarding the ability to provide COTS wired and wireless equipment for a research and development project, on behalf of the Department of the Navy. Specifically, the US Navy is seeking feedback and comments from industry on commercially available wired and wireless technologies that the US Navy could possibly leverage in a demonstration environment. These technologies could eventually be deployed onboard US Navy ships to support day-to-day operations or specific missions. Specific feedback and comments from industry regarding the ability of each technology to coexist with other in close quarters.             b.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. (End of clause)</p>

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within thirty days (30) of contract expiration date. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>52.222-17 Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers. (JAN 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Service employee, as used in this clause, means any person engaged in the performance of a service contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as those terms are defined in 29 CFR part 541. The term "service employee" includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a contractor or subcontractor and such persons.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise provided herein, in good faith offer those service employees employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of award of this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the service employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this contract in positions for which the service employees are qualified.</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of service employees necessary for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ fewer employees than the predecessor Contractor employed in connection with performance of the work.</p>
<p>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, there shall be no employment opening under this contract, and the Contractor and any subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to any person prior to having complied fully with this obligation.</p>
<p>(i) The successor Contractor and its subcontractors shall make a bona fide express offer of employment to each service employee as provided herein and shall state the time within which the service employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the period within which the service employee must accept the offer of employment be less than 10 days.</p>
<p>(ii) The successor Contractor and its subcontractors shall decide any question concerning a service employee's qualifications based upon the individual's education and employment history, with particular emphasis on the employee's experience on the predecessor contract, and the Contractor may utilize employment screening processes only when such processes are provided for by the contracting agency, are conditions of the service contract, and are consistent with Executive Order 13495.</p>
<p>(iii) Where the successor Contractor does not initially offer employment to all the predecessor contract service employees, the obligation to offer employment shall continue for 90 days after the successor contractor's first date of performance on the contract.</p>
<p>(iv) An offer of employment will be presumed to be bona fide even if it is not for a position similar to the one the employee previously held, but is one for which the employee is qualified, and even if it is subject to different employment terms and conditions, including changes to pay or benefits. (See 29 CFR 9.12 for a detailed description of a bonafide offer of employment).</p>
<p>(c)(1) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (b) of this clause, the successor Contractor and any subcontractors (i) may employ under this contract any service employee who has worked for the contractor or subcontractor for at least three months immediately preceding the commencement of this contract and who would otherwise face lay-off or discharge, (ii) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any service employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 6701(3), and (iii) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any service employee(s) of the predecessor contractor whom the Contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular service employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job (see 29 CFR 9.12(c)(4) for additional information). The successor Contractor bears the responsibility of demonstrating the appropriateness of claiming any of these exceptions.</p>
<p>(2) In addition, any Contractor or subcontractor that has been certified by the U.S. Small Business Administration as a HUBZone small business concern must ensure that it complies with the statutory and regulatory requirements of the HUBZone Program (e.g., it must ensure that at least 35 percent of all of its employees reside within a HUBZone). The HUBZone small business Contractor or subcontractor must consider whether it can meet the requirements of this clause and Executive Order 13495 while also ensuring it meets the HUBZone Program's requirements.</p>
<p>(3) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to permit a Contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive order or law. For example, the requirements of the HUBZone Program (see FAR subpart 19.13), Executive Order 11246 (Equal Employment Opportunity), and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 may conflict, in certain circumstances, with the requirements of Executive Order 13495. All applicable laws and Executive orders must be satisfied in tandem with, and if necessary prior to, the requirements of Executive Order 13495, 29 CFR part 9, and this clause.</p>
<p>(d)(1) The Contractor shall, not less than 30 days before completion of the Contractor's performance of services on the contract, furnish the Contracting Officer with a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. Where changes to the workforce are made after the submission of the certified list described in this paragraph, the Contractor shall, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause, not less than 10 days before completion of the services on this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer with an updated certified list of the names of all service employees employed within the last month of contract performance. The updated list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment, and, where applicable, dates of separation of each service employee under the contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors.</p>
<p>(2) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives.</p>
<p>(3) The Contracting Officer will direct the predecessor Contractor to provide written notice (Appendix B to 29 CFR chapter 9) to service employees of their possible right to an offer of employment with the successor contractor. Where a significant portion of the predecessor Contractor's workforce is not fluent in English, the notice shall be provided in English and the language(s) with which service employees are more familiar. The written notice shall be-</p>
<p>(i) Posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite; or</p>
<p>(ii) Delivered to the service employees individually. If such delivery is via email, the notification must result in an electronic delivery receipt or some other reliable confirmation that the intended recipient received the notice.</p>
<p>(e)(1) If required in accordance with 52.222-41(n), the predecessor Contractor shall, not less than 10 days before completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors. If there are no changes to the workforce before the predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor Contractor is not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of performance and the requirements of 52.222-41(n) are met. When there are changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the predecessor Contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less than 10 days prior to performance completion.</p>
<p>(2) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor and subcontractor shall maintain the following records (regardless of format, e.g., paper or electronic) of its compliance with this clause for not less than a period of three years from the date the records were created.</p>
<p>(1) Copies of any written offers of employment or a contemporaneous written record of any oral offers of employment, including the date, location, and attendance roster of any service employee meeting(s) at which the offers were extended, a summary of each meeting, a copy of any written notice that may have been distributed, and the names of the service employees from the predecessor contract to whom an offer was made.</p>
<p>(2) A copy of any record that forms the basis for any exemption claimed under this part.</p>
<p>(3) A copy of the service employee list provided to or received from the contracting agency.</p>
<p>(4) An entry on the pay records of the amount of any retroactive payment of wages or compensation under the supervision of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division to each service employee, the period covered by such payment, and the date of payment, and a copy of any receipt form provided by or authorized by the Wage and Hour Division. The Contractor shall also deliver a copy of the receipt to the service employee and file the original, as evidence of payment by the Contractor and receipt by the service employee, with the Administrator or an authorized representative within 10 days after payment is made.</p>
<p>(g) Disputes concerning the requirements of this clause shall not be subject to the general disputes clause (52.233-1) of this contract. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR part 9. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between or among any of the following: The Contractor, the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the service employees under the contract or its predecessor contract. The Contracting Officer will refer any service employee who wishes to file a complaint, or ask questions concerning this contract clause, to the: Branch of Government Contracts Enforcement, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210. Contact email: <br />displaced@dol.gov.</p>
<p>(h) The Contractor shall cooperate in any review or investigation by the Department of Labor into possible violations of the provisions of this clause and shall make such records requested by such official(s) available for inspection, copying, or transcription upon request.</p>
<p>(i) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the Contractor or its subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, appropriate sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the Contractor or its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order 13495, the regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary, or as otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p>(j) The Contractor shall take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance. However, if the Contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the Contractor may request that the United States, through the Secretary, enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.</p>
<p>(k) The Contracting Officer will withhold, or cause to be withheld, from the prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the same prime Contractor, such sums as an authorized official of the Department of Labor requests, upon a determination by the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, that there has been a failure to comply with the terms of this clause and that wages lost as a result of the violations are due to service employees or that other monetary relief is appropriate. If the Contracting Officer or the Administrator, upon final order of the Secretary, finds that the Contractor has failed to provide a list of the names of service employees working under the contract, the Contracting Officer may, in his or her discretion, or upon request by the Administrator, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of the payment of contract funds until such time as the list is provided to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(l) Subcontracts. In every subcontract over the simplified acquisition threshold entered into in order to perform services under this contract, the Contractor shall include a provision that ensures-</p>
<p>(1) That each subcontractor will honor the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (c) of this clause with respect to the service employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a predecessor Contractor and its subcontractors;</p>
<p>(2) That the subcontractor will provide the Contractor with the information about the service employees of the subcontractor needed by the Contractor to comply with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause; and (3) The recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (f) of this clause.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and -</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>

<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>

<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the Offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the Offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the Offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p><br />Experience, Past Performance, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2 QUOTES SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The offeror shall identify at least two (2) relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years. For each contract, list:</p>
<p>a. Contract number and customer point of contact (including two (2) points of contact <br />With telephone numbers)<br />b. Dollar value of the contract (Original and Final)<br />c. Type of service performed and whether Prime or subcontractor<br />d. Required completion date for the contract<br />e. Date the services were actually completed<br />f. Ship Name, Hull Number<br />g. Contract type (FFP, IDIQ, Requirement, Cost Type)<br />h. Percentage of growth in contract price (Additional work divided by award price)</p>
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br />- Quality of Product or Service<br />Did the customer get what was specified?<br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?<br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?<br />- Schedule<br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />How was the customer service? Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Management of Key Personnel<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>****Past Performance is significantly more important than Price****</p>
<p>Award may be made without any type of discussions or negotiations. This is based on the Contracting Officer's determination after an evaluation has been completed on all offers. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>FAR 52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (OCT 2010) ALT IV <br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required<br />(b) If the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness either in the initial solicitation or in any change to the contract after award, the contracting officer will require submission information in sufficient detail in order to make such determination. <br />The information may be as follows: <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMAL COST BREAKDOWN<br />In addition to placing your offer in the appropriate place in Schedule of supplies and Prices, it is requested that you provide a breakdown of your costs, to include but not be limited to, those items identified in the sample format below:<br />Trade, (i.e. laborers, rigger, etc.)<br />Breakdown of labor grades by trade category<br />Manhours per trade, per labor grade<br />Cost/hour/trade<br />Supplies/materials (description &amp; cost of each)<br />Sub-total<br />Pension Plans<br />Overhead at a rate of ______%<br />Profit at a rate of ________%<br />Total for item _____________<br />FAR 52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity - Separately Priced Line Item (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs.

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>

The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>FAR 52.212-2 QUOTES SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The offeror shall identify at least two (2) relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years. For each contract, list:</p>
<p>a. Contract number and customer point of contact (including two (2) points of contact <br />With telephone numbers)<br />b. Dollar value of the contract (Original and Final)<br />c. Type of service performed and whether Prime or subcontractor<br />d. Required completion date for the contract<br />e. Date the services were actually completed<br />f. Ship Name, Hull Number<br />g. Contract type (FFP, IDIQ, Requirement, Cost Type)<br />h. Percentage of growth in contract price (Additional work divided by award price)</p>
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br />- Quality of Product or Service<br />Did the customer get what was specified?<br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?<br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?<br />- Schedule<br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />How was the customer service? Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Management of Key Personnel<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>****Past Performance is significantly more important than Price****</p>
<p>Award may be made without any type of discussions or negotiations. This is based on the Contracting Officer's determination after an evaluation has been completed on all offers. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>FAR 52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (OCT 2010) ALT IV <br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required<br />(b) If the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness either in the initial solicitation or in any change to the contract after award, the contracting officer will require submission information in sufficient detail in order to make such determination. <br />The information may be as follows: <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMAL COST BREAKDOWN<br />In addition to placing your offer in the appropriate place in Schedule of supplies and Prices, it is requested that you provide a breakdown of your costs, to include but not be limited to, those items identified in the sample format below:<br />Trade, (i.e. laborers, rigger, etc.)<br />Breakdown of labor grades by trade category<br />Manhours per trade, per labor grade<br />Cost/hour/trade<br />Supplies/materials (description &amp; cost of each)<br />Sub-total<br />Pension Plans<br />Overhead at a rate of ______%<br />Profit at a rate of ________%<br />Total for item _____________<br />FAR 52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity - Separately Priced Line Item (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>(2) VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS</p>
<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs.

The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The first floor will host the Rehabilitation Clinic; the second floor will be occupied by the Prosthetics and Eye Clinics.  The existing Clinics are located in a connecting hospital building.  Enroute between the old and new location is an elevator that reaches all needed floors. No furniture, nor equipment will need to be carted outdoors, or on motor vehicle transportation.  The new building will be largely pre-furnished with nearly all of the desks and work stations for the medical providers.  This move is focused as a contents, files, warehouse, and equipment items move.  This effort will be conducted over a period of two weeks.  In the first week the second floor Prosthetics and Eye Clinics will be moved and then activated.  In the following week, the Rehabilitation Clinic will move.  These moves will be conducted during the daytime (Monday through Friday) and Saturday's if needed.  Sundays will be no move days.  Each Clinic's moves are planned in two phases; first day the offices and exam rooms will be moved.  The next phase will move the equipment, storage, and warehouse contents and shelving.  A rigger will be required on the second phase of both clinics move.  In total, the moves have an open window of two weeks for four phases of operations. 
2.  Scope:  The moves services for all locations will require the contractor to appropriately wrap, pack and handle the equipment, office contents, task chairs, file cabinetry, warehouse stock with commercial grade shelving, and heavy equipment items.

FAR 52.232-34 -- Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Other Than Central Contractor Registration (May 1999)

(a) Method of payment.

(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.

(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--

(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or

(ii) Request the Government to extend payment due dates until such time as the Government makes payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).

(b) Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information. 

(1) The Contractor is required to provide the Government with the information required to make payment by EFT (see paragraph (j) of this clause). The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the office designated in this contract to receive that information (hereafter: ``designated office'') by no later than 15 days prior to submission of the first request for payment If not otherwise specified in this contract, the payment office is the designated office for receipt of the Contractor's EFT information. If more than one designated office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the designated office(s).

(2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the designated office. However, EFT information supplied to a designated office shall be applicable only to contracts that identify that designated office as the office to receive EFT information for that contract.

(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.

(d) Suspension of payment. (1) The Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.

(2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension.

(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 

(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--

(i) Making a correct payment;

(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and

(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.

(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--

(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or

(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply.

(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.

(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to the designated office, and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.

(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor's financial agent.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract.

(j) EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause.

(1) The contract number (or other procurement identification number).

(2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s).

(3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this information.

(4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractor's financial agent.

(5) The Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox).

(6) If applicable, the Fedwire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the Contractor's financial agent.

(7) If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fedwire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.

(End of clause)

VAAR 852.203.70  Commercial advertising

As prescribed in 803.570-2, insert the following clause:

COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING (JAN 2008)

The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor.

(End of Clause)


VAAR 852.211-70  SERVICE DATA MANUALS (NOV 1984)
 (a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.
  (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.
  (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions.
  (d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).
  (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.
  (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section.
  (g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.
  (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.
  (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches.

(END OF CLAUSE)


Other Applicable FAR and VARR Provisions

FAR 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)
(a)

(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --

(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;

(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and

(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples.

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.

(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).

This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.


(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of Provision)

(2) Identify the solicitation and/or contract number;

(3) Include an original signed by the protester or the protester's representative and at least one copy;

(5) Specifically request a ruling of the individual upon whom the protest is served;

(6) State the form of relief requested; and

(7) Provide all information establishing the timeliness of the protest.

(b) Failure to comply with the above may result in dismissal of the protest without further consideration.

(c) Bidders/offerors and contracting officers are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures to resolve protests at any stage in the protest process.  If ADR is used, the Department of Veterans Affairs will not furnish any documentation in an ADR proceeding beyond what is allowed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

This provision replaces paragraph (f) of FAR provision 52.212-1. Offers or modifications of offers received after the time set forth in a request for quotations or request for proposals may be considered, at the discretion of the contracting officer, if determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Late bids submitted in response to an invitation for bid (IFB) will not be considered.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Warren Seymour, at warren.g.seymour.mil@mail.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<DESC><p>Below are questions asked about the RFQ and corresponding answers.<br />Question 1<br />What is the number of concurrent users during the busy hour for testing the base test? Is it 1250 users?<br />Answer<br />Section C.4.4.1 of the SOW describes the number of peak visitors required during each two hour test, as well as the ramp up period to achieve that peak level.<br />Question 2<br />Using the table on page 9, Base level only, are you looking for 15,000 concurrent users? Or taking into consideration the 5 minute anticipated visitor duration, if 1,250 concurrent users is what they need.<br />Answer<br />See question 1.<br />Question 3<br />The base test would be for 15,000 users visits per hour is making an estimation per hour of 1250 users being in the web for five minutes. Each concurrent user is making 12 web connects in one hour. This number appears considerably less than the average 2.1 million per hour. Please expand or clarify?<br />Answer<br />The requirements for the web load testing scenarios are articulated in SOW Section C.4.4.1.<br />Question 4<br />The number of page views per visitor shall be 4 per test case , is that correct?<br />Answer<br />The number of page views per visitor shall be 4. The 10 pages per test may not necessarily be linked to one another. The Offeror should assume 1 to 2 test case to page coverage (5 different test cases will need to be developed for the Base year requirement of 10 pages per test), and that test scripts created in the base year can be reused in the option years.<br />Question 5<br />To achieve 10 pages per test will require 3 test cases?<br />Answer<br />The government does not understand the question.<br />Question 6<br />Will the SEC have resources available during the load testing to monitor the web services, databases, and networks band utilization during the testing?<br />Answer <br />The SEC will either actively monitor the internal servers and networks during the load test executions, or will review health reports the following morning.<br />Question 7<br />Post analysis results between testing: what is the expected time?<br />Answer<br />The test results should be available within an hour of the test completion. Any recommendations that result from those results should be delivered within 1 business day of the test completion.<br />Question 8<br />What is the expectation of post analysis support to deliver the results after the load test?<br />Answer<br />See question 7<br />Question 9<br />What is the estimated time line between the five base tests for the two hour test? Please clarify the estimate time between the specific tests: is it an hour, a day, a week?<br />Answer<br />The time between tests will vary based on overall project schedule constraints. The estimated time between test executions will likely be no less than 1 day.<br />Question 10<br />If the test fails what is the expected turnaround time before the next test?<br />Answer<br />The turnaround time for a failed test will vary based on project schedule constraints, and could be the same day or the following day.<br />Question 11<br />"What is your expectation of the 7x24 for 1 year monitoring service:<br />a. How many visits per hour?<br />b. Would we use the same test case?"<br />Question 12<br />a. Visits are expected every 5 minutes to each of the pages or apps being monitored from each of the required points of presences. <br />B. The quoter should recommend what test case(s) to use for this monitoring requirement.<br />Question 13<br />What is the process if the quoted tool is not totally 508 compliant?<br />Answer<br />Per section 6012.02 of the RFQ, a product that is not 508 compliant may be eliminated from further consideration for award. However, per the final paragraph of this section, offerors should submit a VPAT for their products to identify the areas that are and are not compliant and articulate whether a plan is in place to correct the product's deficiencies.</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ) Picatinny Arsenal, has a requirement from the PD TMDE to provide the Next Generation Automatic Test System (NGATS).  <br>    <br>  NGATS is the latest addition to the Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE) developed and managed by the PD TMDE.  NGATS is a reconfigurable, general-purpose, mobile, deployable, Automatic Test System (ATS) designed to provide off-platform sustainment support to all Army weapon systems.  This flexible testing platform will provide diagnostic maintenance of Current and Future Force electronic systems and will standardize the Army's Automatic Test Equipment (ATE).  NGATS tests Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs) by isolating failures to the component level.  Current ATS in the Army inventory, such as the IFTE Base Shop Test Facility (BSTF) V3/V5 and the Direct Support Electrical System Test Set (DSESTS), are experiencing sustainment and obsolescence issues.  NGATS is the answer to filling these needs.  <br>    <br>  In accordance with Statement of Work (SOW), the contractor will produce and support the NGATS Console, perform final integration and verification of the NGATS console into the Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) shelter, and provide engineering services.  Expected products from this effort will be complete production quality NGATS consoles, integration of a subset of the consoles into government provided shelters in accordance with the CLIN structure, a complete technical data package suitable for re-competition efforts, documentation required to maintain the system, logistics support plans and data, a complete set of technical manuals, and all software source code.  <br>

<a href="mailto:kurt.l.kleinlein.civ@mail.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) has a requirement for Combined Screening Team (CST) to assist the Area Support Group-Kuwait (ASG-KU) in performance of screening of non-U.S. citizens seeking employment or access to any U.S. installation within the Area Support Group-Kuwait (ASG-KU) Area of Operations (AOR). The overall goal is to identify, detect, deter, neutralize and exploit all Foreign Intelligence and Security Services (FISS) and all International Terrorism Organizations (ITO).  <br>    <br>  The CST tasks consist of Biometric Automated Toolset (BAT) enrollment, Locally Employed Person (LEP) screening, and Counterintelligence (CI) screening. CST will perform functions for the purpose of granting installation access badges to include enrolling all LEPs in BAT and conducting LEP screenings. CI Qualified Contractors (CIQCs) will conduct CI screening as per LEP screening interview results. Walk-in reports identified by CIQC to have CI value will be referred to ASG-KU-CI. In accordance with AR 381-20, Para 4-1, Sub Para K, CST contractors supporting CI activities will be authorized to perform CI analysis. CST contractors will maintain a local CI database of all Other Country Nationals (OCNs) screened through ASG-KU, which will be populated in the BAT data base. CIQCs will conduct CI screenings of LEPs upon occurrence of CI indicators during the screening process. CST will coordinate with the ASG-KU Direct Support CI Detachment, in order to effectively support CI operations within the scope of this PWS. CST will be equipped to travel and operate from multiple fixed sites, with the assigned Action Officer and IAW unit procedures, but will not conduct intelligence missions outside of secure areas. CST will not be armed or used to conduct source operations or Threat Awareness and Reporting Program (TARP) investigations or briefings. Regardless of any other direction the contractor shall not conduct any COVERT intelligence gathering, as the use of contractors to do so violates Army policy. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government.  <br>    <br>  The ACC-RI intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract under solicitation W52P1J-13-R-0057 using full and open competition. The Government anticipates a base year plus four (4), one-year options. The solicitation is expected to be released on or about 15 April 2013. Potential offerors are instructed to visit the ASFI website: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi to view the actual solicitation when it is released. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to Mr. Kurt L. Kleinlein at kurt.l.kleinlein.civ@mail.mil or Ms. Shanna Smith at shanna.r.smith6.civ@mail.mil.  <br>

Services must be commercially available, meet industry standards for performance and transmission, be capable of interfacing with GSA's existing and future long distance services, and have capabilities and capacities to meet current and potential Government needs.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: The Government anticipates an eight (8) year contract performance period, inclusive of both base period and option periods. <br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted. This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform the resultant contract, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The successful offeror will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. One or more firm fixed price (FFP) indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are anticipated to be awarded. The successful offeror awarded the resultant contract shall be authorized to provide telecommunication services in the State of Alaska (and any subset thereof, i.e. borough, as applicable).

<p><br /><strong>INDUSTRY DISCUSSION:</strong></p>
<p>Background. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) insures multifamily mortgages under a variety of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) programs. The Department assumes the role of mortgagee (that is, lender) under certain circumstances, including: (1) when the borrower defaults, and the FHA-insured mortgagee assigns the mortgage to HUD and files a claim or partial claim for insurance benefits; (2) when a current mortgage is assigned to HUD by the mortgagee pursuant to Section 221(g)(4) of the National Housing Act; (3) when a purchase money mortgage is taken back by HUD to finance the sale of property owned by HUD; or (4) when an FHA-insured or HUD-held first mortgage is restructured under the "Mark-to-Market" (or its predecessor "DEMO") program or when an outstanding insured loan is refinanced and HUD agrees to a Partial Payment of Claim (PPC) on the insured mortgage and, as a result, one or more new subordinate HUD-held mortgages are originated. Collectively, this portfolio is referred to as the HUD Held portfolio.</p>
<p>The HUD Held portfolio currently consists of approximately 3,000 loans (approximately 1,000 first mortgages and 2,000 subordinate ones). M2M and DEMO Notes total 2,400 and non-M2M/demo Notes total 600. Fewer than 10% of the M2M/demo loans are in first position; almost all are subordinate to new insured or conventional financing. Due to the Department's enforcement actions and loan sales, the HUD-&not;Held portfolio may rise to as many as 5,000 loans or fall to as few as 500 loans during a 5 year period. The average unpaid principal balance (UPB) of the first mortgage loans is approximately $2 million, with the UPBs ranging from less than $100,000 to as high as $122,000,000. Although the loans have historically remained in the HUD Held portfolio for an average length of time exceeding 15 years, the average holding period is estimated to be less than 3 years, due to HUD's loan sales and other initiatives. In addition, there are approximately 4,500 202/811 Direct Loans requiring UCC Set Up and Maintenance. Approximately 58% of the current HUD Held portfolio (exclusive of M2M/DEMO notes) is performing under the terms of the original mortgages or under the terms of a modified mortgage. Approximately 3% of the non M2M/DEMO Notes are subject to workout agreements. One or more subordinate HUD-held mortgages may be created on a project whose first mortgage has been restructured under the Mark-to-Market (or DEMO) program administered by the Office of Affordable Housing Preservation (OAHP). These new mortgages are generally "cash flow notes" on which payments are due to HUD only annually from surplus cash. There are usually no reserves or escrows with these mortgages. <br /><br />The numbers of performing loans, modifications and workouts can be expected to vary substantially during a 5 year period. The number of M2M and DEMO Notes is expected to remain fairly constant until they season enough to include in Note Sales. Properties securing these loans may be located in any of the 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands or Guam. Most of the properties securing these loans are multifamily apartment projects, and the remainder is mostly nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Many of the first mortgages have one or more escrow accounts associated with them (reserve for replacement, taxes, etc.).</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, HUD forecloses and becomes Mortgagee-in-Possession (MIP) or owner with respect to some of the properties in the HUD-Held portfolio. In a foreclosure sale, with the foreclosure commissioner, HUD advertises the sale, sells the property at foreclosure and transfers the property to a third-party purchaser. As MIP, HUD will manage the property. HUD also advertises and sells HUD-Owned projects. HUD usually becomes owner of a project by obtaining title at a foreclosure sale, bidding on the debt at a foreclosure sale, or accepting a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a HUD-Held loan. HUD also relocates tenants from defaulted subsidized properties where the physical condition standards are not in compliance with HUD requirements. The relocation, foreclosure, MIP and HUD-Owned projects are referred to as the Property Disposition portfolio. When HUD is MIP or owner of a project, HUD generally contracts with a property manager to manage the operation of the property. In addition, the Property Disposition (PD) Centers administer relocation contracts. It is anticipated that 15-20 relocations may come into the Property Disposition portfolio annually and remain in the portfolio approximately 6-9 months to allow sufficient time for payment of the final invoice. Currently, HUD has about 21 projects in foreclosure; there are 2 MIP properties and 0 HUD-Owned properties. During a 5 year period, it is estimated that approximately 25 to 50 foreclosure projects and 3 to 5 MIP and HUD-Owned projects will enter the Property Disposition portfolio annually, and about the same number will leave the portfolio. The length of time loans (properties) remain MIP varies substantially, but it should be assumed that loans (properties) would remain in this status for approximately one (1) year.</p>
<p>HUD requires a print ad service provider to perform print advertising for foreclosure and HUD-Owned sales. The advertising of these sales currently generates approximately 4 disbursements per week. The average multifamily property, currently in the portfolio, contains approximately 115 units. It can be estimated that properties processed as foreclosure or HUD-Owned sales will remain in the Property Disposition portfolio for approximately 12 to 24 months, although exceptions will occur. The management of the Property Disposition portfolio currently generates approximately five (5) disbursements per week. Each relocation action generates approximately two (2) disbursements per month. In conjunction with the sale of properties in the Property Disposition portfolio, HUD periodically makes Up-Front Grants or Loans to support the rehabilitation, demolition, or redevelopment of the properties. There may be a need to administer the disbursement on Up-Front Grants and Loans.</p>
<p>The Office of Affordable Housing Preservation (OAHP) (previously the Office of Multifamily Affordable Housing Assistance Restructuring or OMHAR) is responsible for conducting restructuring activities for the Department's Mark-To-Market (M2M) Program. OAHP is also responsible for processing other partial payment of claims on insured Multifamily mortgages outside of the M2M program. There is a requirement to direct questions related to M2M, DEMO Notes and Partial Payment Claims (PPC) Notes to the OAHP.</p>
<p>OAHP approves restructuring plans and manages the closing of restructurings, which includes the satisfaction of existing insured or HUD-held debt and creation of new HUD-held M2M/DEMO Notes. The service provider will generally interact directly with OAHP staff on all actions described below, except as specifically noted herein. After M2M closing, properties may include takeout financing (a new FHA-insured or conventional loan), with subordinate M2M debt, usually a M2M Mortgage Restructuring Note (MRN) and a M2M Contingent Repayment Note (CRN). The M2M Mortgage Restructuring Note can be in the primary position if there is no new takeout (currently 138). The majority of the M2M Notes are subordinate debt (currently 2127) which do not require a service provider to bill, collect and administer escrow accounts for taxes and Reserve for Replacements (reserve for replacement). Servicing and Accounting functions under the M2M and DEMO Notes should be handled in the same fashion as other HUD Notes, except for the unique billing and collection and issues caused by the nature of a surplus cash note and the relationship of the Post Closing Portfolio Management (PCPM).</p>
<p>A service organization is needed to provide Multifamily Mortgage Loan Servicing (MLS) and Accounting, Property Management, Relocation and Sales Servicing and Accounting and 202/811 Direct Loan Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Setup and Maintenance.</p>
<p>The service provider must be able to interface data with FHA Subsidiary General Ledger (FHASL). In October 2002, FHA implemented a new OMB-compliant - Off the Shelf (COTS) software package to function as the FHA Subsidiary General Ledger (FHASL). The FHASL currently operates on PeopleSoft Financial (Solaris10 Operating System). FHASL uses the US Standard General ledger chart of accounts and classification consistent with the Federal Generrally Accepted Accounting Principles (FEDGAAP) requirements and Credit Reform. With this implementation FHA now has the capability to record and track budgetary resources control expenditure against available resources, and automatically produce financial statements and other reports from the general ledger.</p>

<p><strong>2. Office of Affordable Housing Preservation- Servicing and Accounting functions for the Mark to Market, and Demo Notes </strong></p>
<p>The service provider shall provide the Servicing and Accounting functions for the Mark to Market, and Demo Notes. The Office of Affordable Housing Preservation (OAHP) Inventory is 2,347 Loans as of February 2013 and is made up of the following:</p>
<p>&bull; 135 Notes that require monthly billing and collections for principal, interest (usually amortizing), and /or escrows.</p>
<p>&bull; 1,379 Notes with annual billings and collections. The service provider will prepare and Bill for the annual payment which is based upon Surplus Cash calculations. The annual billing uses the amounts due as reported in the Annual Financial Statements. Billing is also subject to adjustments based upon the results of a Surplus Cash Analysis and review, currently performed by another outside contractor (the Post Closing Portfolio Management, or PCPM, contractor). HUD holds the 2nd mortgage in almost every instance here. These are the Mortgage Restructuring Notes.</p>
<p>&bull; 671 Notes with no billing or collections for payments to Principle and Interest until satisfaction of the notes referenced in the categories above. In most instances, the notes in this particular category will move up to the second category referenced above.</p>
<p>&bull; 162 Notes are primarily Balloon notes with no annual billing or collections, but will become due and payable either at maturity or it matures simultaneously with the note in one of the previous category. Deferred interest is accrued and paid at maturity.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that OAHP will be closing approximately 40 new transactions on an annual basis. The majority of the 40 new notes will fall under the second category referenced above, requiring an annual Surplus Cash Analysis billing, collection and application of payments.</p>
<p>Services include:<br />&bull; Establish and Maintain relationship with HUD's lockbox facility in order to retrieve and post all loan payments. We are fairly certain that the Locbox is a separate HUD contract.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ); IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  <br>  <br> 1.0 DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future RFP will not be entertained.  <br>  <br> 2.0 SUBJECT: The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is conducting market research to assess the commercial availability or technical maturity of technologies that are capable of satisfying the capability gap for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases (ID) in austere environments. Moreover, the USAMRMC wishes to receive industry comment on both the commercial interest and the commercial viability of diagnostic devices capable of meeting our needs, inclusive of affordability given the projected Department of Defense (DoD) demand. Attachment 1 describes the USAMRMC Target Product Profile (TPP) for ID diagnostic capabilities. Of note is the Key Performance Parameter (KPP) of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance. Commensurate with this parameter, respondents should strongly consider associated development cost, post FDA-clearance costs, and overall commercial viability both globally and in the US market in order to determine if candidate products can be sustained in a way that is both profitable to the company and affordable by the DoD.  <br>  <br> 3.0 Background: In the absence of approved prophylactic drugs and vaccines, prevention and early diagnosis remain the best option to mitigate the impact of certain ID pathogens in US Service Members. The USAMRMC has a need to develop and field (in a sustainable and affordable manner) forward-deployable, rapid, ID diagnostics that meet or exceed the specifications listed in Attachment 1 (see ATTACHMENT A). Recently, the USAMRMC prioritized diseases and pathogens of interest for rapid diagnostic devices (see Table 1 in ATTACHMENT A). This table, although not comprehensive, lists those IDs for which diagnostics are needed based on military end-user desirability and potential impact. Additionally, Table 1 lists the anticipated DoD annual purchase quantities . Note: Table 1 depicts the diseases and pathogens that are the USAMRMC's top priorities. However, the USAMRMC also has interest in developing other ID diagnostic capabilities that are not included in the table. Procurement quantities are subject to change and industry should comment on the feasibility of sustaining the capability on the US market given the procurement quantity listed.  <br>  <br> Prior to determining the acquisition strategy, the USAMRMC must assess the commercial market for availability and maturity of commercially developed ID diagnostic candidates that are both rapid and forward-deployable (henceforth referred to as quote mark candidates quote mark ) and gauge industry interest in developing these candidates for the US market. Moreover, the USAMRMC must ensure that a sufficient US market and industry interest (in that market) exists to warrant investment in development and (more importantly) sustainment of these candidates (following FDA-clearance) at quantities and cost that are sustainable in the marketplace and affordable to the USAMRMC.  <br>  <br> Specifically, the USAMRMC is interested in determining the following:  <br> A. determining what infectious disease diagnostic products industry is either developing or currently marketing in the US or in foreign markets.  In particular, the USAMRMC is interested in candidates that can be used to diagnose the USAMRMC ID Pathogen Priorities shown in Table 1 and that meet specifications in Attachment 1.  <br> B. the current developmental status of each candidate  <br> C. how specifications of each candidate compare with the USAMRMC threshold/objective specifications (Attachment 1)  <br> D. reasons why FDA clearance is or is not being considered for each candidate  <br> E. the support interested industry sources will require from the DoD (technical and scientific expertise, clinical sites, research and development financial support, the anticipated annual DoD purchase that will be required to  sustain each product on the US market and at what unit cost  <br>  <br> In answering item 3.0 C, please consider that in order for the USAMRMC to be able to field a candidate, it must meet or exceed the specifications listed in Attachment 1.  In short, these specifications include, but are not limited to: FDA-cleared, no greater than moderate complexity, usable in austere environments (without the requirement for electricity or for ancillary laboratory equipment not provided with the diagnostic test), relatively small and lightweight, fielded with external controls, and provide results rapidly. It is preferred that the candidates will be usable by medical personnel (such as a medic or physician assistant) without specialized medical laboratory technician training.  As such, it is anticipated that CLIA-waived status will be required in order to field candidates in far-forward operating environments.  Industry sources should provide their perspective on the complexity and feasibility of obtaining CLIA-waived status. <br>  <br> Although the MRMC is interested in technical performance of industry ID diagnostic candidates, respondents should concentrate a majority of response content on the business case and sustainability of such assays in the US market.   Ultimately, the USAMRMC wishes to gauge industry interest and obtain industry feedback in order to assess the viability and affordability of developing and (subsequently) maintaining a supply of ID diagnostic capabilities on the US market that meet our specifications at an affordable price; given our anticipated demand level. Respondents should address these items as explained in Section 4.0.  <br>  <br> 4.0 Response Instructions:  <br>  <br> Respondents should address the following in their submission:  <br> A. Name and address of company  <br> B. Names and contact information of key company personnel  <br>  <br> Note: For items 1 through 13 (below), please provide answers for each product candidate you possess that corresponds to a USAMRMC need; i.e.  ID pathogen priorities listed in Table 1 and that meets or exceeds the specifications in Attachment 1.  <br>  <br> C. Description of each ID diagnostic candidate currently in development that is (or will be) capable of meeting or exceeding the specifications in Attachment 1 to include:  <br> 1. Name of proposed candidate(s)  <br> 2. Intended use or proposed intended use  <br> 3. Technical Description: A brief technical description explaining the technology utilized and manufacturing methods used and anticipated (or proven) sensitivity and specificity.  <br> 4. Description of Packaging/Kit: Either current or proposed  <br> 5. Ancillary Equipment/Consumables: Description of any equipment and consumables required to utilize the assay kit; indicating if each item is included with the kit (or not).  <br> 6. Package Insert (if available)  <br> 7. Candidate Maturity: Please briefly describe the developmental status (ex: in clinical performance evaluation) and/or clearance status of the candidate to include (as applicable) FDA-clearance status and/or any clearance/obtained marketing permits for use in foreign countries. If not yet FDA-cleared, please comment on your interest in achieving FDA clearance and an estimated time frame for achieving FDA clearance. If not FDA cleared, please briefly describe your quality system for assay manufacture (ex: GMP, ISO, etc).  <br> 8. Projected selling price range per assay (please specify ranges for both US and foreign markets). It will be assumed that the US market price range will reflect the selling price to the DoD. Costs for the US market should be inclusive of external controls.  <br> 9. Projected US and foreign market sales  <br> 10. Projected annual US market sales volume (# of assays) needed to sustain the assay in the US market, at the price range described in item h.  <br> 11. Minimum batch/production run size (# of assays / batch)  <br> 12. Willingness to pursue FDA clearance and the US market 13. Willingness and ability to serve as the regulatory sponsor (510(k) holder) <br>  <br> D. For the following items, please respond in general, i.e., not on a candidate specific basis.   <br> 1. Please describe the barriers to US market entry as you see them and provide suggestions on how the DoD can help to make rapid diagnostic development more viable and sustainable. To that end, explain and/or answer the following:  <br> 2. General capabilities and limitations of your company that may require assistance from the USAMRMC  <br> 3. Feasibility of and willingness to pursue CLIA-waived status (in general) of candidates that have the potential to meet Attachment 1 specifications. Comment on whether CLIA-waived devices are within your strategic plans. Why or why not?  <br> 4. Please comment on the overall market and sales with emphasis on US market and sustaining that market. Include commentary on continuing to market candidates in the US both with and without DOD demand. Specifically, are capabilities of this type sustainable in the US market at the DoD demand levels depicted in Table 1? If not, what is a more realistic DoD demand that the USAMRMC should consider?  <br> 5. Please describe (in general) any concerns you may have involving the sustainability of ID diagnostic products that meet or exceed USAMRMC specifications given the size of both US and foreign markets, and your anticipated profit margins. Expand on issues that you think the USAMRMC should consider in further considering development and acquisition strategy in terms of the potential to decrease unit cost and achieve better overall sustainability.  <br> 6. Please describe any developmental or commercial partnerships and/or relationships that would facilitate development and fielding/supply to the US market.  <br>  <br> 5.0 CONTACT INFORMATION: Any and all questions related to this RFI shall be directed to Shannyn Scassero at shannyn.scassero.civ@mail.mil no later than 21 MAY 13. All information regarding Capabilities Statements or any other proprietary information relative to this RFI shall be submitted via email to shannyn.scassero.civ@mail.mil no later than 12:00 PM ET on 14 JUN 13.  <br>  <br>

No solicitation will be available. The draft BOA and the BOA submittal requirements are posted on FED BIZ OPPS in conjunction with this announcement. The United States Coast Guard Civil Engineering Unit Oakland is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8 (a) firms serviced by SBA District Offices in Washington, Oregon and California, and other 8(a) participant with SBA recognized bona-fide places of business in Washington, Oregon and California to participate in a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Pilot Program. BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the US Coast Guard, Civil Engineering Unit (CEU) Oakland, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of construction services, if and when ordered. The BOA contains contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to all task orders issued under the BOA according to the dollar amount of each task order. Annually, CEU Oakland will review the continued need for the BOA in light of (a) usefulness and need for services and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year. Under the BOA, 8(a) firms compete on task orders for maintenance, repairs, construction and construction related service requirements pursuant to the BOA. General contractors are preferred, but specialty contractors will be considered as well. Individual projects will be solicited and awarded if and when required.

Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issues hereunder. Either party may cancel the agreement with 60 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on task orders issued prior to the effective date of cancellation.</p>
<p>SOLICITATIONS: Each project solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror, and evaluation criteria and the basis for award to be used for each project. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, may consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. If the award basis will be on price alone, the Contractor may be required to furnish a bid bond with each proposal over $25,000. CEU Oakland will require Payment Bonds on each task order over $30,000 and Performance Bonds on task orders over $100,000. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time.</p>

Questions must be submitted by using the 'Submit a Question' feature at www.fedbid.com. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.*** <BR> <BR>For this solicitation, VHA NCO 02 - 528 - Upstate New York HCS intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 02 - 528 - Upstate New York HCS is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>Award will be based on lowest price technically acceptable. Failure to include the required specification documentation will be considered non-repsonsive.  Solicitation is FOB destination and quote should reflect that accordingly. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>FBO Posting 402-0099-13, Request for Information: Supply Chain Risk Management Risk Analysis Database, Questions and Answers 12 - 36, posted May 14, 2013
<p>Q12. Can you please provide examples for requirement: Would these be system generated action items, i.e. flags, due to an out of compliance found on a vendor? Or when new requests come in? Or another option?<br />A12. System generated action items for companies without assessments, to resolve out of compliance assessments and other possibly dependencies as a business process.</p>
<p>Q13. Please confirm that the end users will provide all the risk analysis rules and risk mitigation plans and the logic for selecting the appropriate risk mitigation plan.<br />A13. The Government confirms.</p>
<p>Q14. Number of vendor and products?<br />A14. There is not a finite number of vendors and products.</p>
<p>Q15. In Item 2, Description of Services, it is stated that the "The database will allow requisitioners to input detailed information regarding a specific procurement; based on this information, the database will then identify potential risks and mitigation approaches". Will the identification of potential risks and the mitigation approaches be an automatic process or will it be a manual process. <br />A15. Automatic process.</p>
<p>Q16. If it is automatic then we have the following questions <br />Question: Number of rules of risk evaluation. Are these rules one step or multi step? <br />Answer: Multi step. Rough Order of Magnitude is 30 - 50.</p>
<p>Question: Number of rules for selecting the risk mitigation plan. Are these rules one step or multi step?<br />Answer: Multi step. Rough Order of Magnitude is 30 - 50.</p>
<p>Question: Number of risk mitigation plans. Are these static set or will the Analysts continue to add/edit these? <br />Answer: Government users will add/edit. Rough Order of Magnitude is 30 - 50.</p>
<p>Question: Will the rules be static or dynamic in terms of new rules and editing/updating old rules? If the system has to allow the user to add/edit new/old rules then we need a rules editor capability AND some kind of an expert system technology to process the rules.<br />Answer: Dynamic.</p>
<p>Q17. If it is going to be a manual process then we have the following questions<br />Question: Please explain the process of identification of potential risks for a specific procurement.<br />Question: Please explain the process of identifying the best risk mitigation approaches for the same procurement.<br />Answer: Not applicable.</p>
<p>Q18. Item 6.1.4.5 - How many preformatted reports are there?<br />A18. Rough Order of Magnitude is 30 - 50.</p>
<p>Q19. Item 6.1.4.5 in terms of your requirements for "customizable reports". Are you looking for a report designer built in?<br />A19. The Government seeks a standard database tool for reporting, i.e., one that allows reports to be generated by selecting data items.</p>
<p>Q20. Item 6.1.3 - Please clarify which records will be added at the rate of 500/month.<br />A20. Acquisitions/procurements/similar items.</p>
<p>Q21. Item 6.1.4.7 - Tracking action items for SCRM Analysts. Please explain the scope of this feature.<br />Answer: The purpose is to identify actions that need to be taken by the SCRM analysts.<br />Question: Should there be a calendaring function to allow the analyst to set up the schedule?<br />Answer: No.<br />Question: Should there be a alerting/notification capability?<br />Answer: Tracking / notifications should be within the system.<br />Question: What happens if the analyst does not respond to the alert? Should there be a backup person?<br />Answer: Tracking / notifications should be within the system.</p>
<p>Q22. Is there a preferred development platform (Windows/.Net OR Java/J2EE)?<br />A22. No preference.</p>
<p>Q23. Preferred database platform (MS SQL Server versus Oracle)?<br />A23. No preference.</p>
<p>Q24. Should the application support Apple's IOS and/or Google Android devices?<br />A24. No.</p>
<p>Q25. You are asking for a firm fixed price. But because the design specs are not fully identified nor finalized, so will there be room to update the price once the requirements are finalized? Alternatively can we provide a price range?<br />A25. This is a Request for Information, not a quoted or proposed price. Submitted prices are used for market research purposes.</p>
<p>Q26. Is the required risk mitigation for the development of the software platform or is risk mitigation required for the data imputed into the platform?<br />A26. Risk mitigation is performed by analysts based on risks identified through the database functions.</p>
<p>Q27. Are there any OCI constraints?<br />A27. This is a RFI and used for market research purposes.</p>
<p>Q28. Will there be an O&amp;M requirement for the database?<br />A28. Yes but that is not part of this RFI.</p>
<p>Q29. What is the location of the government facility where the integration work will occur?<br />A29. Washington, DC metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Q30. Will the government require analytical support for mitigation activities?<br />A30. Not part of this RFI.</p>
<p>Q31. Does the Government anticipate releasing a Draft RFP for this procurement? If so, is there an anticipated date of release? <br />A31. This is a RFI and used for market research purposes.</p>
<p>Q32. Will there be an Industry Day for this procurement? <br />A32. This is a RFI and used for market research purposes.</p>
<p>Q33. What is the anticipated timeline for the release of the Final RFP? <br />A33. This is a RFI and used for market research purposes.</p>
<p>Q34. We will be hand delivering our RFI response and would like to know if there are any special instructions that we need to know about. <br />A34. Please follow the instructions and do not hand deliver. Submittal of your quote will be in two parts: one electronic by email and the other of hard copy. Hard copy submittal is by postal mail to the address specified.</p>
<p>Q35. Under the Introduction section, it's mentioned that this notice does not constitute a request for a quote or proposal, however, under section 7, this notice does request a firm fixed price for the database as well as other pricing for different scenarios, add-ons, etc. Given the unusual request for pricing within an RFI, can you please clarify how the pricing received will be used and any caveats a responder might use with its submission (i.e. may we call it a ROM or estimate, etc., or will we be bound by the pricing provided)?<br />A35. This is a Request for Information, not a quoted or proposed price. Submitted prices are used for market research purposes.</p>
<p>Q36. We would like to know if the Government requires a CD with our hardcopy delivery.<br />A36. Submittal of your quote will be in two parts: one electronic by email and the other of hard copy. Please do not submit a CD. For hard copy, use paper; for electronic, use an electronic file sent by email.</p>

<AWARDEE>Plateau Systems LTS (INC) 4401 Wilson Blvd #400 Arlington, VA 22203
<DESC>NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION NASA SHARED SERVICES CENTER LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION I recommend NASA, NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC) negotiate with Success Factors (Formally Plateau Systems Ltd) for continued maintenance of the Agency's Learning Management System (LMS) software licenses required for NASA's SATERN Training Management System. This action will result in a delivery order issued against GSA Contract GS-35F-0069M. The total estimated cost of this effort is $XXXXX.  The period of performance is for a (1) one year base period and three (3) one year option periods: Base period  May 1, 2013 through April 30, 2014 Option period 1 May 1, 2014 through April 30, 2015 Option period 2  May 1, 2015 through April 30, 2016 Option period 3  May 1, 2016 through April 30, 2017 This procurement is for the renewal of annual software maintenance services for the Agency's current Learning Management System (SATERN) license which currently supports a user base of 75,000 users. The maintenance will consist of the following: 	The delivery of Releases, Versions, Correction Levels and Software correction packages, technical support via telephone, and remote support/update. 	Maintenance of Success Factors Training Materials. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), which implements the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program cited in FAR 8.401 pursuant to Title Ill of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies, for the acquisition of supplies or services when only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because of the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.	 Under the Federal eGov initiative, NASA competitively selected Success Factors in   late 2005, to be the primary commercial off the shelf (COTS) software vendor for the management and documentation of NASA-wide training.  Success Factors LMS is uniquely positioned in the market to provide the services as required due to their proprietary ownership of the software and knowledge of best practices for which the product can and has been implemented for other federal agencies. 2.   Success Factors is solely positioned to support NASA's continued implementation and support of its product capabilities/enhancements due to their detailed knowledge of NASA's existing configuration.	This knowledge has been obtained via the existing contract vehicle previously managed on NASA's behalf by OPM's GoLearn Program. 3.	No other vendor has access to detailed and timely knowledge of the Success Factors LMS existing and emerging product set, especially with regard to ongoing development and product planning which directly benefits NASA's ongoing activities to improve training management throughout the Agency. 	   4.	Additionally, other impacts would result in a total loss for customizations and patches. This is because Success Factors owns the application and code, and they are the only vendor licensed to provide support requiring code changes. Currently NASA	is in discussion with the application vendor for the following: a.	corrective patches for 508 Compliance issues  b.	External Training Request Form Review option c.	Item details drops from catalog when Enable Order is set to No d.	Link Search is missing after proxying into a Users record e.	Add Item Curricula ID to learning plans, history and curricula 5.	Finally, any issues that arise due to the release of a new Browser version (such as Firefox 10 or Internet Explorer 10), new flash, or new Java would never be  resolved. While configuration changes might work to alleviate such issues, they would always be a work-around, never a true correction. Pursuant to FAR 8.404, BPAs or orders placed against a MAS, using the procedures in this subpart, are considered to be issued using full and open competition (see 6.102(d)(3)). Therefore, when establishing a BPA (as authorized by 13.303-2(c)(3)), or placing orders under Federal Supply Schedule contracts using the procedures of 8.405, ordering activities shall not seek competition outside of the Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize the requirement.   However, the Limited Source Justification will be synopsized at www.fedbizopps.gov within 14 days after award pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(2). Pursuant to FAR 8.404(d), GSA has already determined that prices of supplies and fixed-price-services, and rates for services offered under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable.  Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing.  However, NASA will seek additional discounts from the GSA listed prices. Market research conducted including a search of the internet and the GSA Schedules determined that no other companies are authorized by Success Factors to provide software maintenance. Success Factors does not sell their source code to Value Added Resellers (VAR), therefore competition could not be obtained and another vendor could not maintain the software.  Consequently, no other manufacturer or VAR is capable of providing this service at this time.  Due to the specialized nature of this requirement, there are no known actions which the agency may take to remove or overcome barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for the services required.  Therefore, purchase of the services from Success Factors is the only practical approach. I hereby certify the facts in this justification and any supporting data used for this justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

Notice: Sole-Source Announcement

1.	The Department of Veterans Affairs SAO West, NCO 19 Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center proposes to enter into an emergency repair purchase order with an ending date of 17 June 2013. Nevertheless this is an urgency of need requirement, there is only on responsible source and no other services will satisfy Denver VAMC requirement. Therefore, this shall be a sole-source request using FAR 6.302-1 The purpose of this requirement is to procure services to repair TWO (2) Orthopat Auto transfusion Systems Model 1050110-ENG; SSN: 02767T-1 and 10F107.  The repairs are because of mechanical failures resulting in blood leaks rendering the device unusable; because the hardware and software is proprietary, the repair cannot be handled by any unauthorized field technician. These repairs are urgently needed for the Denver VA Medical Center Operating Room (OR) and applicable medical emergency procedures. 

2.	The Orthopat Auto transfusion System is needed to deliver the patient's own red blood cells with high hematocrit and reduced risk of infection for the patient.  The OR is short these two devices.  The OR has had to adjust and delay scheduling of patient orthopedic joint (hips/knees) replacement surgeries.  This is limiting the number of cases that can be done in a day.  This is creating a greater backlog for the service.  Patients needing hip replacement and knee replacement surgeries are going without these potentially life-saving procedures and enduring a reduced quality of life.

3.    The approximated expenditure for the repairs is not greater than $10,000; $5,000 price of repairs for each             Orthopat. The original purchase price for each Orthopat was $16,000 each. A not to exceed repair cost of $5,000 for each Orthopat shall be illustrated in the contract. Cleaning charges shall be applicable.
