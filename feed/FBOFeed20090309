<DESC>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: •	Program name •	Government or contractor POC •	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. •	Date & period of performance •	Cost of effort •	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, we’re looking for ways to implement a “throttle”  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources  must respond with a complete Request for Information package of no more  than 10 pages though, providing everything requested above. All parties  are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, an e-mail  address, and a facsimile number in their response. This information should be sent electronically to Mr Rick Fennell at  ricky.fennell@wpafb.af.mil.  Responses should be received no later than 15  March 2007. For more information on "C-17 Aircrew Training System/Maintenance Training  System (ATS/MTS) Sustainment Re-Compete", please refer to:  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5147

Evaluation Criteria:

The FDA will evaluate the offerors proposal submission based on Technical, Past performance, and Price as described below.  Technical, Past Performance, and Price are of equal importance.

A- Technical Approach and Expertise: 
	The offeror’s proposal shall include a detailed, technically and methodically sound maintenance plan for all Heimann x-ray machines listed for FDA locations in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and a plan addressing procedures for scheduling maintenance and performing repair and service of equipment within a 24 hour response time.  The plans shall include how maintenance and service calls will be administered.  The plan shall include the personnel and material resources to be committed to accomplishing the plan and indicate the assignments of key personnel.  The plan must also demonstrate the offeror’s understanding of all relevant industry related technical and mechanical methods and the managerial skills required for timely completion of all tasks set forth in the Statement of Work which shall include, but are not limited to, the following:

1)	Demonstrated evidence that offeror’s repair/maintenance technicians are formally trained and certified by Smith’s Detection on Heimann X-ray Machines and other related equipment.
2)   Demonstrated evidence that offeror’s technicians are experienced in maintenance and
       repair of Heimann X-Ray machines and other related equipment list in the Statement of
       Work
3)	The adequacy and suitability of the offeror’s support personnel, and subcontractor(s) support personnel.  Identify personnel who will be assigned to this requirement and demonstrate their qualifications, background, recent experience and specific accomplishments.
4)	Demonstrated evidence that the Contractor has a sufficient number of personnel or subcontractors and to be able to respond within a 24 hour timeframe. 
5)	Demonstrated evidence that the Contractor has accessibility to official Heimann equipment and parts.

Emergencies: 
Demonstrate the ability to support adequate staff and services in the event of an emergency.
Organizational Experience : 
Demonstrate organizational experience in managing a maintenance and service contract for x-ray machine equipment.
1)	Evidence of the availability of Heimann x-ray machine spare parts and materials for warranty and service calls.

Quality Control Plan: 
Offerors shall submit a quality control plan, which addresses the adequacy and approach of the maintenance and service contract for the Heimann x-ray machines owned and operated by the FDA.
B- Past Performance:
Past Performance findings will be highly influential in determining the relative merits and risks associated with the Offeror’s proposal in a comparative assessment with all competitors.  The Government will evaluate the reputation and quality of the Offeror’s past performance.  The assessment of the Offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the Offeror to other Offerors.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  The Government is seeking to determine whether an Offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.
Offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the Offeror’s response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration.  In investigating the Offeror’s past performance, the Government will consider references submitted by the Offeror and may consider information from other sources.  Some of the questions in the referenced evaluation questionnaires are associated with point values and some are included in the questionnaire without point values to allow the Government a subjective assessment of the Offeror’s performance.  The Government will make a subjective evaluation of past performance in consideration of both average scores and responses to subjective questions.
A minimum of three corporate references from contracts with a similar scope and nature completed within the last three years will be evaluated.  Information may also be obtained from sources other than those identified by the offeror.  

C - Price: 
FDA will evaluate the offeror’s submission/proposal on their ability to provide support at a reasonable and realistic price (to include any discounts offered).

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for applied research that lead to the development of efficient, theoretically sound, and consistent algorithms for organization and fusion of high-dimensional data sources as well as automated methods for image understanding.

The future naval battlespace requires an integrated sea-land-air capability in support of joint military operations potentially conducted with other services and allies. In this complex tactical picture, information gathering, processing, analysis, and understanding to enhance battlespace awareness is at the heart of the concept of joint operation. With emerging advanced technologies, information is collected in bulk from multiple data sources, either sensor-based or human-based, at a rate that exceeds the rate that humans can analyze, understand, and respond. To support highly complex and integrated naval operations with the deluge of data in a timely manner, it is imperative that certain data processing leading to situational awareness and analysis are automated to alleviate the workload for human operators and present them with only pertinent information.

Within the battlespace a Naval focus is the development of the underlying computational tools to support adaptive, persistent surveillance capabilities for situational awareness, for mission planning, for force protection, etc., in the maritime domain. The maritime domain extends from 250 miles offshore to 200 miles inland, and covers a variety of environments including ocean, littoral zones, riverine environments, deserts, urban areas, etc. In adaptive persistent surveillance scenarios data is obtained from all sources, individual and networked sensors, as well as from non-sensor sources. The data may also be current or from archived databases. The network of sensor assets should be able to perform surveillance autonomously with only minimal, high-level human supervision. Therefore, the surveillance system must be able to self-coordinate and navigate autonomously, recognize and track interesting objects and agents, dwell on relevant scenes, discard irrelevant data, index and store data of interest for forensic investigations and after action analysis, and provide timely alerts with pertinent information to warfighters.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for a Landscape Contractor to provide nursery and landscape services in support of the Art and Architecture program related to the construction of the New U.S. Courthouse in Rockford, Illinois.  The procurement will be issued as a lump sum, firm fixed-price contract open to all business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.  

The project scope for this procurement is to find a Landscape Contractor to provide nursery and landscape services.  The services will be comprised of a base period of twenty four months plus three (3) one year options to the contract to provide maintenance.  

The base work includes but is not limited to the selection of 154 crabapple trees (104 of which will be planted at the project site), growing, digging, preparation, transporting trees, planting, lawn repair seeding, and installation of steel edging and French drains are all included in the base scope.  A selection of five distinct varieties of crabapple trees will comprise the 154 trees.  The tree installation will be irrigated by work provided by others.  The Contractor shall coordinate irrigation volume with others.  The Contractor shall grow or arrange to contract grow, by no later than late spring 2009, the specified trees to the desired caliper by the targeted delivery date in spring 2011.  The completed installation will be considered a living piece of art, as part of the Art-in-Architecture program. Options 1, 2, & 3 include weekly maintenance of the tree installation, and exclude the maintenance of turf.  

The “best value trade-off process” will be utilized in this procurement for the evaluation of offers and the selection of the successful Offeror to receive the award.  The Government will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of both the technical factors and the total evaluated price.  For this procurement, the technical will be significantly more important than price.  The technical factors will include experience and past performance on similar projects, qualifications and experience of key personnel, project plan and geographical location/ proximity to project site.

Small Business Participation:  In accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, this procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns. Although this procurement is open to large business, small businesses are encouraged to participate. In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, disadvantaged, veteran owned, service disabled veteran owned and HUBZone businesses through subcontracting opportunities.  In the event a large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement) is the awardee, an acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by SBA prior to award of this contract. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to have participation from small, small disadvantaged, small woman-owned, small HUBZone and small veteran-owned business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 561730 with a size standard of $7 million.  

Joint Ventures:  Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality contractor team effort.

Interested Parties/How to Offer:  The solicitation package will only be available electronically and is anticipated to be available on or about March 24, 2009.  The solicitation package will be available on the FedBizOpps website, www.fbo.gov.  The offer due date and time for receipt of proposals will be on or about April 23, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. (Central Standard Time).  In order to be eligible for award, offerors are required to provide electronic representations and certifications at www.bpn.gov/orca and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information.

Potential offerors must register on the FedBizOpps website to have access to solicitation material.

This conference will permit prospective offerors the opportunity to clarify any concerns regarding the RFP, and tour the grounds at the New U.S. Courthouse in Rockford, Illinois.  We consider attendance at this conference important to the preparation of a competitive and cost effective proposal and to understanding the total result desired by the Government. Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions and miscalculations in offers.  Additional details regarding the pre-proposal conference will be included in the RFP.

As required of FAR 6.303-2, each justification shall include the following information:  1. Requesting Agency:   		Department of Veterans Affairs					Veterans Health Administration 					Decision Support Office					200 Springs Road Ads					Bedford, MA 01730    Contracting activity:		Austin Information Technology Center (AITC)1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 78772 2. Nature and/or description of the action: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to procure from Eclipsys Corporation, a one-year contract with options to renew for four years for the continuation of the Eclipsys Transition II (TII) software used by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for its Decision Support System (DSS).  The contract will be for maintenance and technical support of the existing software and the creation of customized programs, adaptations and extracts to meet VA's changing business needs.  The VHA will acquire the required service through the Austin Information Technology Center's contracting activity. 3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):   The contractor must provide the following:I.	Maintain the current software in a production ready state to include:a.	Periodic maintenance releases and new version product update software for installation.b.	Appropriate software modifications when the software malfunctions, or when the software does not meet the specification contained in the functionality presented to the VA.c.	Be complete with all technical documentation that fully describes the release and update instructions to install the release on the mainframe at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC).d.	Be fully tested in a VA test environment and certified by the Contractor that the release contains all VA specific codes and procedures in full working order prior to release to the VA for testing and installation.e.	Be production ready at a time mutually agreed to by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) and the Contractor.f.	The contractor shall make appropriate expertise available to attend conference calls and face-to-face meetings in order to maintain the DSS operational application during the term of this contract.II.	Provide software enhancement support.a.

The contractor shall modify existing Eclipsys code to:i.	Incorporate into the processing cycle new source extracts (inputs to the system) or national data extracts (outputs from the systems) or modifications to both types of existing extracts when requested.ii.	Repair global errors when the data being processed with current code results in inaccurate patient utilization or encounter data due to the condition of the source data.iii.	Support the annual fiscal year conversion.iv.	Support ongoing efficiency and effectiveness endeavors that modify either the operating system or Eclipsys software code or VA custom code.III.	Support of the Operating systema.	The Contractor shall provide support of the software operating system on the AITC's mainframe consisting of: i.

An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:Title 41 U.S.C. 253.(C)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:"	The current Eclipsys code for the VA's Decision Support System is proprietary to Eclipsys.  VA has a restricted rights license to use the software.  VA does not have the code.  Therefore, only Eclipsys can maintain the software."	The Eclipsys software is more than an activity based cost accounting system.  It takes the financial data and aggregates it to the department and product level.  It also attaches each product (patient utilization) to a veteran's episode of care thereby allowing reconciliations and cost comparisons at the patient level.  Additionally, the current system captures approximately 600 data fields that are unique to the VA operation.  Some of these fields provide additional patient clinical data, which can be used in analyses to enhance patient care and effectively manage resources.  No other supplies or services will satisfy VA's requirements. "	Each of the 128 VHA facilities has slightly different clinical practice patterns and methods of recording data used by DSS.  There is approximately 18 years of custom coding in the software to ensure the accuracy of data from the 86 financial and workload extracts from each of these sites.  Additionally, Eclipsys developed the custom mainframe routines used to run the system. Reconstructing this custom code for another application would be extremely time consuming, and create substantial risk to the continuance and effectiveness of the program.  No other supplies or services will satisfy VA's needs.  "	Any other vendor would be required to learn the VA business model, implement their system in 316 locations and then through extensive testing determine the amount of custom code needed to accommodate incomplete workload capture.  This would create a substantial duplication of costs to the VA since both systems would need to run concurrently to ensure continuity of data reporting.  VA could not recover these substantial duplication costs through competition.  "	Replacing the current system VA has been using for years would require extensive training of VA personnel.  The expense of this training could not be recovered through competition. "	There are approximately 5 terabytes of active DSS data and about another 8 terabytes on tapes that would need transformation if another system was installed.  There is substantial risk that this vital historical data could not be used to trend workload, practice patterns or determine if scarce resources are being effectively used.  "	Replacing the entire system VA has in place would not only be extremely expensive, complex and risky, it would result in unacceptable delays in VA fulfilling its requirements.  A cost benefit analysis was conducted and if award was made to another contractor there would be substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition."	Replacing the system that has proven itself with one that is unproven and untested in the unique VA environment would create substantial risk to the continued ability of VA to manage its resources and to improve the care to the veterans it serves.  A host of current DSS users would need to alter processes to accommodate changes, which introduces substantial risk for the continuance of the gains made to improve veteran's care.  Further:o	The system meets the legal requirements for a Managerial Cost Accounting System.o	The Allocation Resource Center (ARC) uses DSS patient cost data to formulate the reimbursement to each VHA facility.  Any changes to the source system would require substantial testing and alteration to the reimbursement process.o	Some medical centers use DSS data to create their budgets based on the allocation from the ARC thereby being able to track variances between budget and actual cost.o	The ARC also uses DSS clinical data to answer inquiries from Congress that directly effects the funding to the VA for special programs.o	VA management at all levels uses DSS data to better manage outcomes of patient care and to allocate resources.  There are over 100 financial and workload reports on the DSS web site to meet the needs of these end users.o	Nursing Service is using DSS data to track the ratios of nurses to patients to insure adequate coverage.o	DSS data is used for medical center performance measures.o	At least 15 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) have data warehouses tailored to accept data from the current system.6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  A sources sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps on 2/18/09.  Although ten (10) responses were received an analysis indicated that none of the interested contractors have a solution that will meet the needs of the Government, from the standpoint of technical, cost, and schedule, as detailed in paragraph 5 above.7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The Contracting Officer will ensure that the firm-fixed prices are consistent with historical cost data on the current contract, as well as being comparable with other contracts for similar requirements, and be in line with the independent Government cost estimate.8. A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.In addition to posting a sources sought notice on FedBizOpps, the following resources were researched:  American Health Information Management Association; Bearing Point; College of Healthcare Information Management Executives; Department of Health and Human Services - Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society;KLAS; Medical Records Institute; The Health Technology Center; The Scottsdale Institute; Price Waterhouse Coopers; and various vendor web sites.9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as (COTR/PM to provide): "	The Office of Manage and Budget (OMB) requires VA to conduct periodic operations analysis of the system.  Price Waterhouse Cooper conducted one in 2000.  BearingPoint conduced one in 2004.  There is currently another one in progress.  The Price Waterhouse Cooper review recommended keeping the current system due to the cost benefit analysis being unfavorable for any other system.  The Bearing Point review identified other available systems but their analyses neither accounted for the costs of running concurrent systems during implementation, which would create an unfavorable cost benefit analysis, nor was there any assurance those systems could handle the workload generated by the VA.10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.   ASM Research Inc.Teradata Government Health SolutionsCGI FederalAEI - Stratus Consulting GroupLockheed Martin Information Systems and Global ServicesSAS Federal Health PracticeIBMLongview International Technical Solutions, Inc.FedSources, Inc.INPUT11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required (CO to provide).  "	VA conducted extensive market research to determine if any other software could meet its needs."	VA will include option in solicitation for software source code so that VA or VA contractor could maintain the software in the future.12. Certification requirement:  (Technical/requirements personnel must certify).  I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Government's minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division, Eglin Air Force Base, Valparaiso, Florida is conducting a Sources Sought Synopsis for market research purposes. <br />Title: X-Ray Computed Micro Tomography (XCMT) Machine</p>
<p>Background: We are seeking a tool to investigate the microstructures of composite materials ranging from energetic materials to concretes. We would like to make non-destructive measurements and construct a 3-D renderings which could then be input into a computer model, as well as use these microstructures to determine characteristics of the compacted materials such as specific surface area of primary particles and particle/pore geometry characteristics. Particle sizes of organic explosive might be as small as several microns, while the aggregate in concrete would be considerably larger, and therefore require samples greater than 65 mm in diameter.</p>
<p>We are specifically interested in taking the 3-D structures provided by the XCMT machine and turning it into a computational mesh. This would probably best be done if the 3-D image is in some kind of CAD format. In any event, we want to take the actual internal structure and generate a computational mesh in order to perform analysis on that known structure.</p>
<p>We would like to have the capability to perform dynamic tensile and compression testing of specimens, this is not mandatory but it is highly desired.</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements consisting of the following:<br />1. At a 5 mm sample size, 1 micron resolution is required.<br />2. At a 50 mm sample size, 10 micron resolution is required.<br />3. Largest sample size to be at least 65 mm diameter by 100 mm long.<br />4. The ability to handle materials that have similar material contrast. For example, must be able to resolve table sugar dispersed in a polyurethane binder, as well as fine aluminum powder (~20 micron) dispersed in a polyurethane binder.<br />5. Must be able to examine samples that are irregularly shaped.<br />6. Require that the XCMT can effectively handle a large variety of materials from carbon fiber composites, polymer foams, machined parts, metal specimens and high explosives with large range of Z materials.<br />7. Ability to convert the data to 3-D computer generated image which can be put into a mesh file for computer simulations.<br />8. Must be able to fit through a 6 foot wide and 6 foot high door.<br />9. Software for quantitative analysis and for presentation.<br />10. Must produce negligible X-Ray signature outside of instrument so that no dosimeter is required for personnel when working with or around the XCMT continuously (2000 hrs/yr).<br />11. New Materials: All parts used in this system must be new. No recycled, refurbished, or otherwise used parts are permitted in this system.<br />12. Utility Requirements: The vendor will provide all electronic controllers as well as interconnection and power cables required for operation using 110 VAC, 60 Hz power. The system must be air cooled and not require water hook-up. If chilled water is required for instrument cooling, the chilling unit must be provided with the instrument and operate using 100V, 60Hz power. Vendor will describe in writing the utility requirements (including connections and capacity) upon contract approval so that appropriate infrastructure arrangements can be made prior to shipment of XCMT.<br />13. Documentation/Data: Require a copy of all documentations, user instructions prior shipments.<br />14. Delivery, Installation, and Training: Provide approximately delivery date of the system, installation of system on site, and training for two operators.<br />15. Serviceability and Warranty: Vendor will clearly describe which parts are covered under the standard Warranty, the duration of the standard Warranty. Vendor is invited to propose as an option an extended Warranty plan which will cover all parts, labor, and travel charges for a limited time period.<br />16. Vendors are invited to submit as an option a tensile/compression load cell capable of at least 440 N for a sample size diameter of at least 20 mm in the XCMT.<br />17. Vendors are invited to submit as an option advanced computational capabilities to reduce time required to manipulate/transform data, or convert data between different file formats.<br />Interested parties with the ability to satisfy the minimum requirements should submit corporate information to include commercial brochures and/or technical capabilities of the proposed system. The Government will not pay for information requested or compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.<br />This is not a solicitation announcement and this notice does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions for future requirements.</p>

<p>Minuteman III Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer (PIGA) Float<br />NSN: 1420-01-386-7795 AH</p>
<p>This request is an announcement for information/market research for planning purposes. The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.<br />1.0 SUBJECT:<br />Sources sought for the repair of the float sub-assembly used in the Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer (PIGA) instrument for the Minuteman III guidance system. This repair supports the 526th Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Systems Group (526 ICBMSG) which is responsible for the ICBM missile guidance set.<br />2.0 DESCRIPTION:<br />Honeywell DSES-Space, Clearwater, Florida (CAGE Code 09128) is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the only qualified source of repair for the PIGA Float since 1975. Honeywell is the only known source that currently has the capital-owned support equipment, high tech facilities and proprietary data necessary to manufacture and repair the PIGA Float. The PIGA float consists of parts made of I400 Beryllium which is hazardous and requires specialized equipment, handling procedures and stringent safety requirements. Some of the Beryllium components are coated with an aluminum oxide using a plasma powder spray and finished to tolerances within millionths of an inch. Every part of the float requires precision machining and a tremendous amount of attention to detail. The float body alone is the size of a thimble and consists of more than 200 critical machining measurements. A pyroceram glass and ferrite ceramic material are also used in the PIGA float.

<DESC><p>This request is an announcement for information for planning purposes only. This sources sought does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Request for Quote, or Invitation for Bid. Nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government's acquisition approach.</p>
<p><br />The Air Force Technical Application Center (AFTAC) is seeking interested sources for Phase 4 (P4) of the US National Data Center (US NDC) program. The US NDC is the geophysical data acquisition, data processing, reporting and archiving component of the United States Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS) operated by the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC). AFTAC's mission is to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties to standards set by US verification and policy leaders. This mission requires the US NDC to detect, locate and identify foreign nuclear tests and provide rapid reporting and technical assessment to the appropriate national security agencies and policy makers. The US NDC processes and integrates data and information up to and including the Department of Defense (DoD) SECRET level. The US NDC also serves as the data distribution center for all US government and authorized users for International Monitoring System (IMS) data. The focus of this phase is to add increased functionality to the current baseline, fine-tune current systems by increasing performance level, upgrade existing hardware, and sustain the present operational systems.</p>
<p><br />The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data acquisition and processing system which provides the capability to receive, process, archive and report events of interest in monitoring nuclear treaty requirements. It acquires waveform data from a global network of seismic, hydroacoustic and infrasonic stations. Data is stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external to AFTAC, and reliably forwarded to a classified processing system. The US NDC receives data from the International Data Center (IDC) originating from International Monitoring System (IMS) sensors on U.S. territory and from other countries. Users interactively review, refine, correct, and display currently available results.</p>
<p><br />The US NDC consists of the following components: (a) A 24x7 operations center located in the AFTAC Operations Center (AOC), Patrick AFB, FL (PAFB); (b) A 24x7 alternate (ALT) hot-backup system located at Goodfellow AFB, TX (GAFB); (c) A Training System located at the 312th Training Squadron GAFB; (d) A Remote Operations Center (ROC) located at PAFB (used to support unplanned and/or short term AOC outages, fire drills, etc.); (e) The US NDC Sustainment System (SUS, aka the test-bed) and (f) the US NDC Development System (DEVL), both located at AFTAC/PAFB.</p>
<p><br />Current System Parameters include the following:</p>
<p><br />1) Hardware: SUN SPARC-based servers and workstations, Storage area network drives, LTO3 tape archives<br />2) Software: Solaris 8 &amp; 10, Oracle 10g<br />3) Code: C, C++, FORTRAN, PERL, Scheme, SQL, Lisp, ASM, CSH, Java, Makefile, SH, TCL, YACC</p>
<p><br />The operational US NDC hardware (OPS, Alt, Training System, and Remote Operations Center) along with most of the development/sustainment hardware is and will continue to be maintained through a separate AFTAC maintenance support contract.</p>
<p><br />Contractor responsibility will include the development and integration of a total system including ongoing upgrades, advanced geophysical studies and tuning/optimization of software algorithms. All personnel must have a Secret clearance and all key personnel must have a Top Secret (SCI) clearance. A majority of the work will be done within the AFTAC building at Patrick AFB, FL. Therefore, the contractor must have or establish a facility in Florida and have key personnel available to work within AFTAC.</p>
<p>Examples of new and ongoing US NDC development and sustainment items include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p><br />1) One of the primary objectives of the Phase 4 effort is to provide a software and hardware architecture with implementation which will provide the platform for future system growth and enhancements. The functionality shall maintain and enhance existing data acquisition, detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation, event classification, event reporting, data distribution, and data archiving capabilities to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs as specified in the US NDC System Requirements Document (SRD).</p>
<p><br />2) A second major objective of the P4 effort is to make use of modern, object-oriented (OO) software design and development practices to re-architect the US NDC's legacy source code/software baseline that has evolved over the past 15+ years. The most immediate need/target is the interactive analysis tool suite.</p>
<p><br />3) Integration of 3rd party efforts: The Department of Energy (DoE) and Air Force labs, as well as various government contractors are involved in numerous areas of US NDC development. Some examples are: portions of the knowledge base, event classification methodology, and Geographical Information System (GIS). It will be the prime contractor's responsibility to team with these AFTAC partners and integrate their products.</p>
<p><br />4) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing Total System Integration Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC. The US NDC contractor is responsible for integration of hardware, COTS/GOTS software and calibration information, and contractor developed software into the US NDC system.</p>
<p><br />5) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing 24x7 on call support to insure 99% operational availability rate.</p>
<p><br />6) The US NDC contractor participates as a key member of the US NDC Change Management Board (CMB) to insure the US NDC will continue to meet the operational availability requirements. The CMB oversees the US NDC Change Request (CR) process and prioritizes O&amp;M work which includes but is not limited to software bug fixes and minor enhancements, adding new stations to data acquisition and both station and network processing.</p>
<p><br />7) Studies<br />a) Conduct scientific studies to help improve detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation and event classification to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs.<br />b) Conduct engineering and IT infrastructure studies (e.g., hardware, software, databases) to help improve overall system performance and help reduce maintenance costs and man power needs.<br />All applicable upgrades to the US NDC shall also be made to the training system, and to the Alt US NDC, both of which are located at Goodfellow AFB TX.</p>

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the conductof the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory Mission (CLARREO), InfraredInstrument Concept Study.  The foundation for CLARREO will be its ability to produceirrefutable climate records through the use of exacting on-board traceability of theinstrument accuracy to international measurement standards.  Current satellite-based sensors are not designed to meet the accuracy requirements forclimate measurements.  Many sensors used for climate measurements are designed to meetoperational weather needs and are not designed to meet the demanding calibrationaccuracies required for climate measurement.  The CLARREO mission is intended to meetclimate needs through careful consideration of the instrument design, calibrationtraceability at all stages of development and operation, and spectral, spatial, andtemporal sampling focused specifically on the creation of accurate, long-term climatedata records.CLARREO is one of several Decadal Survey missions defined in 2007 in a report issued bythe National Research Council (NRC).  LaRC (in conjunction with NASA Headquarters and theEarth Systematic Missions Program Office) is conducting an integrated Pre-Phase A missionstudy leading to a Mission Concept Review (MCR).In support of the Pre-Phase A mission study, NASA LaRC intends to conduct concept studiesof infrared (IR) remote sensing instruments capable of meeting the CLARREO measurementrequirements.  The studies shall cover instrument architecture, instrument conceptualdesign and risk mitigation planning. The objectives of the IR instrument concept studiesinclude the following.a)	To verify that suitable IR instrument technologies and concepts either exist, orcould be developed in a timely manner, to meet the requirements of the CLARREO mission;b)	To identify promising low-TRL (Technology Readiness Level) IR instrument conceptsso that, if deemed necessary by NASA, development of the associated instrumenttechnologies could be conducted for timely infusion into the CLARREO project schedule;c)	To provide NASA with IR instrument concept data that will support NASAs Phase Adevelopment of an overall CLARREO mission architecture and spacecraft configuration; andd)	To reduce CLARREO project risk by identifying technological and programmaticchallenges associated with the IR instrument development, fabrication and delivery.No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sitesfor the release of any solicitation or synopsis.Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet theabove requirement should submit a capability statement of 5 pages or less indicating theability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business;average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether theyare large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of yearsin business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potentialteaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potentialprime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant workperformed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and pointof contact - address and phone number).

<a href="mailto:barbara.dejoie@mms.gov">Dejoie, Barbara</a>
<DESC>U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a competitive requirement for a Geoscientist Training Program being awarded to the offeror whose proposal gives evidence of the greatest value to the Government as outlined in the Statement of Work below.
Statement of Work/New Geoscientist Training Program
Introduction The Geoscience professionals at the MMS are responsible for evaluating fair market value of offshore leases, ensuring conservation and diligence of resource development, estimating the volume of public resources and reserves, and assuring safe operations throughout the Gulf of Mexico.  A training program to bring the many new employees and FCIP personnel up to speed as soon as possible is essential.
Objectives
With critical time frames outlined by the OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2007-2012, new employees need an accelerated training program to bring them to minimum levels of competency in a shortened time frame.  This training program needs to accommodate 10 to 20 new employees, be intensive, concentrated, and tightly integrated with geology, geophysics and engineering disciplines. This training program should also be commercially available in an off-the-shelf configuration designed for oil and gas prospect and development analysis.  The training should integrate critical hands-on experience to allow the new employee to return from training and immediately contribute to mission goals. The training must start June 1st, 2009 as there are already 12 to 15 new employees on board that are mandated to be trained by the FCIP program or are just new hires that need to be incorporated into Unit assignments as soon as possible.  Required areas of competency for an MMS Geoscientist are structural styles; sequence stratigraphy; open-hole log analysis; seismic survey design, acquisition, and processing; 2-D and 3-D seismic subsurface interpretation; subsurface geological mapping; oil and gas prospect identification; field determination and mapping; and field performance and reserves estimation.  Also, overviews of the oil and gas industry in general are important for these new hires as many of them have little or no Gulf of Mexico backgrounds.  Through past history at the MMS this training must also include an intensive mentored mapping project workshop in conjunction with the classes in a controlled environment with measureable results.  Furthermore, the training needs to be at MMS, New Orleans.
Scope	To provide a concise but complete training program to FCIP employees and other new hires with up to one years experience at the MMS.  The training program is to cover the gamut of disciplines and techniques in the fields of oil and gas exploration and development.  The program should be a structured set of training classes and exercises in conjunction with an extended interpretation and mapping project.  The training is to take place as soon as possible, in a limited time frame, and is expected to substantially raise the competency level and knowledge of the new employees.

Training Requirements
- Course	Because of the many new hires at the MMS these classes and final project are to be bundled as one continuous course; must commence no sooner than May 1st, 2009 and conclude no later than October 30th, 2009; and will be at least 10 weeks but no more than 15 weeks in duration.

<DESC>The Land Resources Division of the National Park Service (NPS) is looking for a two-day course in writing legal land descriptions.  This class will be held in Spokane, Washington during the week of June 22, 2009.  This class shall follow the principals outlined in Wattles, Gurdon H., Writing Legal Descriptions, 1976.  This course will serve as a refresher for individuals with substantial experience writing legal descriptions as well provide individuals new to this discipline a complete foundation of knowledge necessary to write and interpret legal descriptions of real property.  As such, the instructor should have at least 15 years of experience in this field and be able to answer difficult questions about specific situations encountered when writing legal descriptions.
 Experience working with the Department of Interior (DOI) is preferred.  This class should include a brief history of legal descriptions in western civilization as well some instruction in traditional methods used to plot legal descriptions.  However, the focus of this course shall be on the parts of a legal description (preamble, body, clauses) itself and what is required in a good legal description.  While legal descriptions for sectionalized land will be covered the majority of the class should focus on metes and bounds descriptions.  The class shall include several hand-on exercises.  Some of these exercises should assume complete survey data is available while others shall assume the description will be drafted entirely by using other parcels already on record in the public repository.

<DESC>The Government's intent for soliciting information from industry is to determine market availability and potential sources of supply for power efficient techniques to disrupt Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) used by terrorists.
The Naval Sea Systems Command is soliciting information from industry regarding power efficient techniques to disrupt RCIED.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify potential sources of supply for unique techniques that may improve the effectiveness of existing or future Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems.  The desired solution may fit most or all of the following specifications:
.	Ability to defeat advanced, complex, RCIED that maybe used today or in the future.	Ability to perform in real or simulated combat conditions.	Ability to perform while moving on a military vehicle or foot-mobile configuration.	Technique at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) stage 6 or higher is required.	Technique should require two or less antenna mounting locations and should be flexible with respect to antenna placement/integration with host platform
The host platform needed to demonstrate the technique may be in the form of an existing CREW system with an adjunct technique integration kit.  Alternatively, the technique may be designed with an interface to enable integration into a test bed or notional future open architecture CREW system.  The desired technique solution, after integration with a host platform, may fit most or all of the following specifications:
.	Technique should be capable of operating from military vehicle auxiliary power at nominal 28 volts DC and have total system power consumption of less than 500 Watts .	Technique may also be used for man portable configuration host platforms that require use of battery power and associated man pack weight constraints (a very low system weight is highly desirable for a man pack configuration).	Ability to log data of interest when integrated with a host platform.	Design of integrated technique/host system should incorporate human factors engineering principles.	Design of integrated technique/host system should have a built in test or test procedure to verify proper operation.	Status indicators for operators that could be viewed by others nearby should only convey unclassified information such as operation/standby mode, transmit power level, high temperature warning, etc.	Environmental in accordance with MIL-STD-810F (-20 to 65 degrees C operational/-30 to 70 degrees C storage).	Ruggedized vehicle standards for shock, vibration, dust, etc

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J) Program Management Office (PMO), in coordination with DISA's Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), is requesting information to determine sources with CORE competencies and demonstrated experience in developing and sustaining Command and Control (C2) software for the GCCS-J Program Management Office (PMO). GCCS-J is the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Command and Control (C2) system of record (SOR) for achieving full spectrum dominance. GCCS-J is the principal foundation for dominant battlespace awareness, providing an integrated, near real-time picture of the battlespace necessary to conduct joint and multinational operations. It enhances information superiority and supports the operational concepts of full-dimensional protection and precision engagement. GCCS-J provides a robust and seamless C2 capability to the Commander-in-Chief (CINC), Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), National Military Command Center (NMCC), Combatant Commanders (CDRs), Joint Force Commanders, and Service Component Commanders. Employing the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), GCCS-J offers vital connectivity to the systems the joint warfighter uses to plan, execute, and manage military operations. GCCS-J is a fielded and mature system in use by operational forces today and continues to evolve to satisfy all validated and prioritized requirements and address changes in joint warfighting doctrine and business processes, and to keep pace with technology and emergent requirements.</p>
<p>GCCS-J is a major Information Technology investment and is designated an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IAM Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program. Through approval of the GCCS-J Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) and subsequent progress reporting, the GCCS-J Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and Component Acquisition Executive (CAE) monitor the investment's cost, schedule, and performance. GCCS-J is being implemented in an evolutionary manner through distinct blocks, using spiral development. Each block is self-contained, targets a specific set of Joint Staff (JS) validated, prioritized user requirements, and delivers multiple releases of GCCS-J functional capabilities, in accordance with an Assistant Secretary of Defense, Networks and Information Integration (ASD (NII))-approved APB. GCCS-J employs a predominantly open system client/server architecture, which is evolving to a web-based architecture that allows a diverse group of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) software packages to operate at any GCCS-J location. GCCS-J integrates C2 mission applications/capabilities, database, web technology, and office automation tools. It fuses select C2 capabilities into a comprehensive, interoperable system by exchanging imagery, intelligence, status of forces, and planning information. A key portion of the GCCS-J functional capabilities are the force planning products commonly referred to as the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES). It is the functionality encompassed in these products, which provides the Joint Staff and Unified commands their primary conventional war planning tools and capabilities. GCCS-J has been designed from the user's perspective, characterized by short design and development cycles, incremental fielding of functionality, operational prototyping, developer liaisons and rapid response to user problem reports.</p>

<DESC>On behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT),Vehicle Health Management System (VHMS) the US Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center, Maneuver Ammo Center is interested in potential sources that have the capability to provide logistics development and support with a focus on early design influence, logistics consequences and cost estimates for decision making, acquisition logistics documents, plus fielding and support plans for the VHMS.  The VHMS effort is currently focused on big weapon platforms organic to the Heavy Brigade, like the Abrams Tank, Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and Paladin 155mm Self Propelled Artillery.  Because each of these platforms is a complex system by itself, the integration of vehicle health status and maintenance information from an entire Brigade multiplies the factors to consider when acquiring this System.  The contractor would help the Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) management team develop and present VHMS logistics plans and products for PM-HBCT and other approvals, then provide oversight for Platform and HBCT implementations. The contractor would work directly for the ARDEC VHMS Logistics Lead who will assign tasks and negotiate schedules, receiving general supervision from the Leader, ARDEC Munitions ILS Competency Team.  Plans must be compatible with the Common Logistics Operating Environment (CLOE), Condition Based Maintenance, and Logistics Management Information with intermediate information pull-offs within a Brigade.  The contractor would be assigned to lead and/or support efforts like a Logistics Integrated Product Team, supportability analyses, Cost Benefit Analyses (CBA), common VHMS-related hardware and software, user interfaces, communications and database interfaces, comments on VHMS documents developed by an array of working groups, diagnostics & prognostics, plus logistics risks and issues.  Related tasks may be assigned in the realm of policy research and papers. Interested parties should notify Paul Giovannoli, CCJM-MA, Building 10, Picatinny Arsenal, N.J. 07806-5000, 973-724-2136, EMAIL ADDRESS  paul.giovannoli@us.army.mil by providing a capabilities statement and list of resources available. Responses should also indicate business size and any socio-economic considerations under NAICS Code 541614. This Market Survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This Market Survey is not to be construed as a commitment by the U. S. Government.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  No award will be made as a result of this Market Survey, as this is a request for information only.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil  65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>The TRICARE Southeast (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4) and Northeast (TRBO Reg. 1) Regions, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 93 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of CRUTCHES, CANES and ACCESSORIES. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across Southeast and Northeast region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source (s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in this multi-regional initiative include: Southeast Region - Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Commuity Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS), the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  Northeast Region - Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC), National Naval Medical Center (Bethesda, MD), Malcolm Grow Medical Center (Andrews AFB, MD), Dewitt Healthcare System (FT Belvoir, VA), Keller Army Community Hospital (WestPoint, NY), and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (FT Meade, MD).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The Southeast Region has been designated as the Lead TRBO for this standardization action.  The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is July 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Southeast and Northeast region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<BR> <BR>Point of Contact: Virginia Slayton, (706)787-2093, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Region are seeking product line items in the category of CRUTCHES, CANES and ACCESSORIES, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within the Southeast and Northeast region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $134,333.18.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast and Northeast Southeast and Northeast regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Virginia Slayton, (706)787-2093, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EDT on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Southeast region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Southeast Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EDT on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Lead TRBO Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Regions Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast and Northeast region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast and Northeast region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.

Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor. <BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>  <BR>1.

Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Crutches, Canes and Accessories products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the Lead TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) attention at the participating Medical Treatment Facilities and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the Medical Treatment Facilities by COB, 5:00 PM EDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the Lead TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  <BR>2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale.   A one to five scoring range will be used to rate the sample products.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>4.	To determine acceptability, the Clinical Product Team (CPT), comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast and Northeast Regions will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a non-clinical / non-patient care setting. <BR>    <BR>The following Clinical /Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Standard and Forearm Crutches<BR>1.	(Patient Safety) Height mechanism adjusts quickly with only simple steps required to make the adjustment.<BR>a.	 The ability to adjust the crutch height quickly and simply will assist patients and clinicians in making safe and accurate adjustments.  National Patient Safety Goal #9  Reduce the risk of (patient) harm resulting from falls<BR>b.	The evaluator will adjust the crutches and note whether adjustments can be performed easily and quickly.<BR>2.	 (Patient Safety/Comfort) Hand grips minimize undue strain on the hand/wrist during crutch use.  <BR>a.	An ergonomically designed and padded hand grip supports the palmar arch and wrist without causing undue rotation of the hand.  A proper handgrip also reduces; pressure on veins, arteries and nerves in the hand which helps decrease muscle fatigue and the potential for nerve damage.  National Patient Safety Goal #9  Reduce the risk of (patient) harm resulting from falls.    <BR>b.	Evaluator will ambulate, non-weight bearing, with crutches and note any wrist/hand discomfort related to hand grips.<BR>3.	(Patient Safety)Tips of crutches stay securely seated on the crutch, and promote stability, during ambulation.<BR>a.	Tips that are easily dislodged from the crutch or tend to slip during ambulation may increase the possibility of a patient falling during crutch ambulation. Any patient fall may cause injury.  National Patient Safety Goal #9  Reduce the risk of (patient) harm resulting from falls.    <BR>b.	Evaluator will ambulate, in a non-weight bearing manner, with crutches and note whether the tips stay securely seated during ambulation.  <BR><BR>Standard Crutch ONLY<BR>4.	(Patient Safety/Safety) Underarm pads minimize underarm discomfort during crutch use.<BR>a.	Crutch pads without certain ergonomic features (smooth, curved surface with non-bulky padding) increase underarm friction causing irritation and soreness. Underarm pads use also decreases the potential for axillary nerve damage. National Patient Safety Goal #9  Reduce the risk of (patient) harm resulting from falls.    <BR>b.	Evaluator will ambulate with crutches in a non-weight bearing manner, and note any underarm discomfort related to underarm pad design.  <BR><BR>Canes ONLY<BR>5.	(Patient Safety/Comfort)Cane handle is comfortable. <BR>a.	 A properly designed and padded hand grip supports the palmar arch and wrist without causing undue rotation of the hand during cane use, minimizing muscle fatigue. National Patient Safety Goal #9  Reduce the risk of (patient) harm resulting from falls.    <BR>b.	Evaluator will ambulate using the cane in a partial weight bearing method, and note any wrist/hand discomfort related to the cane handle.<BR><BR>6.	(Patient Safety) Tips of canes stay securely seated on the cane, and promote stability, during ambulation.<BR>a.	Tips that are easily dislodged from the cane or tend to slip during ambulation may increase the possibility of a patient falling during ambulation. Any patient fall may cause injury.  National Patient Safety Goal #9  Reduce the risk of (patient) harm resulting from falls.    <BR>b.	Evaluator will ambulate, in a non-weight bearing manner, with canes and note whether the tips stay securely seated during ambulation.  <BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process:  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast and Northeast Region combined.  Pricing must be received at the Lead TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EDT), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Southeast and Northeast region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast and Northeast Region). <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Southeast and Northeast region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Southeast and Northeast regions, (Post-Standardization Costs).  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  Operational Impact of RIA prices on the LSA Region are considered more important than other pricing elements.   THE CLOSING DATE IS 31 MARCH 2009 5:00 PM EDT.<BR><BR><BR> <BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil   65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>The TRICARE Southeast (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4) and Northeast (TRBO Reg. 1) Regions, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 93 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of MANUAL RESUSCITATION BAGS. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across Southeast and Northeast regions based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in this multi-regional initiative include: Southeast Region - Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Commuity Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS), the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  Northeast Region - Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC), National Naval Medical Center (Bethesda, MD), Malcolm Grow Medical Center (Andrews AFB, MD), Dewitt Healthcare System (FT Belvoir, VA), Keller Army Community Hospital (WestPoint, NY), and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (FT Meade, MD).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The Southeast Region has been designated as the Lead TRBO for this standardization action.  The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is July 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Southeast and Northeast region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<BR> <BR>Point of Contact: Virginia Slayton, (706)787-2019, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Region are seeking product line items in the category of MANUAL RESUSCITATION BAGS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within the Southeast and Northeast region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $101,618.00.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast and Northeast regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Virginia Slayton, (706)787-2019, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EDT on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Southeast region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Southeast Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EDT on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Lead TRBO Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Regions Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast and Northeast region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast and Northeast region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to Virginia.Slayton@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor. <BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>  <BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of disposable/single use Manual Resuscitation Bags with configuration options.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.<BR>a. At a minimum the vendor must provide the following:  Disposable /single use Manual Resuscitation Bags with configuration options available in a range of bag volume sizes (adult, pediatrics and infant).  Adult Resuscitation Bags must be provided fully assembled (non re-breathing valve, self-inflating bag, swivel patient adapter and mask), Pediatric disposable resuscitation bags must be fully assembled (non re-breathing valve, self inflating pediatric volume bag, swivel patient adapter and pediatric mask), Infant manual resuscitation bag must be fully assembled (non re-breathing valve, self-inflating infant volume bag with infant size mask) and available configuration options for each size  (oxygen tubing, reservoir bag, disposable manometer, pressure relief valve, adjustable peep valve).<BR>b. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufactured and /or distributed by brands) via catalog, and literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal...  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for Manual Resuscitation Bag product line.  Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor (PV) (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor for the Southeast and Northeast Regions) for Manual Resuscitation Bags in the Regions.   (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Vendor MUST provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Manual Resuscitation Bag products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question<BR>6.	Vendor MUST provide Manual Resuscitation bags that are latex free/safe.<BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the Lead TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) attention at the participating Medical Treatment Facilities and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the Medical Treatment Facilities by COB, 5:00 PM EDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the Lead TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.  <BR>2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale.  A one to five scoring range will be used to rate the sample products.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>4.	To determine acceptability, the Clinical Product Team (CPT), comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast and Northeast Regions will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a clinical patient care setting. <BR>    <BR>The following Clinical /Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.	(American Heart Association Guideline__Provider must avoid fatigue to avoid poor CPR results) Manual Resuscitation Bag is light weight.<BR>a.	Light weight bag reduces user fatigue.  <BR>b.	Evaluator will perform bag compressions observing the pressure needed to compress the bag and support needed to manage the bag.  <BR><BR>2.	(American Heart Association Guidelines__Manual adult ventilations should be performed at 12 breaths per minute) Resuscitation Bag is self-inflating.<BR>a.	Self-inflating allows required ventilation per minute.  Resuscitation bag does not require compressed oxygen to provide adequate mechanical ventilation.<BR>b.	Evaluator will observe resuscitation bags ability to refill timely after each compression.<BR><BR>3.	(American Heart Association Guideline__Resuscitation Bag must be compressed firmly with one-hand to delivery adequate tidal volume that cause patients chest to rise) Bag design allows one-handed grip    <BR>a.   Comfortable hand fit will allow uniform compressions.<BR>b.   Evaluator will grasp resuscitation bag with one hand to squeeze/compress bag for manual ventilation noting the bag to hand fit and ease of operation.<BR>      <BR>4.	(American Heart Association Guideline__Provide high quality CPR with fewer interruptions)     Manual Resuscitator has swivel patient adapter.<BR>	a. Swivel adapter facilitates easy position change without interrupting ventilation.<BR>                  b. Evaluator will manually check adapters ability to swivel before attaching to   patient.<BR><BR>5.	(American Heart Association Guideline__Good continuous face mask seal during both ventilation and compressions is critical)  Mask is clear with facial cuff.<BR>a. Clear mask allows observation of patient for skin color changes and facial cuff provides air tight seal.<BR>b. Evaluator will observe chest rise with compressions which indicate adequate tidal volume is being delivered. Evaluator will maintain visual observation of the patients face for skin color changes or vomiting during CPR.      <BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process:  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast and Northeast Region combined.  Pricing must be received at the Lead TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EDT), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Southeast and Northeast region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast and Northeast Region). <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Southeast and Northeast region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>	<BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Southeast and Northeast regions, (Post-Standardization Costs).  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  This is included as a reporting Matrix. Operational Impact of RIA prices on the LSA Region are considered more important than other pricing elements.   THE CLOSING DATE IS 31 MARCH 2009 5:00 PM EDT.<BR><BR> <BR>

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Arthropod-Borne Animal Diseases Research Laboratory (ABADRL), Laramie, Wyoming, intends to enter into a single source contract with Cepheid, Inc., Sunnyvale, California, for a SmartCycler TD System.  This thermocycler is identical with ABADRL's current field-deployable equipment that has been used to develop and validate arthropod-borne viral diagnostic tests both iin the laboratory and in the field.  The additional thermocycler is needed to increase capacity and to have the capability of performing simultaneous and comparable assays at more than one location and must be compatible with the Government-owned equipment ABADRL is currently using.  This equipment has been used to develop and validate arthropod-borne viral diagnostic tests because it is compatible with instrumentation available at international collaborator institutions and primary end-users of the technology.  Identical equipment iocated in multiple locations is required so that the results are consistent.  This is an international "One Health, One Medicine" effort predicated on having a consistent tool for emergency zoonotic disease responders.  This instrument is required to be compatible with equipment currently available at the U.S. National Animal Health Laboratory Network, Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories and collaborating emergency zoonotic disease outbreak responders.  There are numerous patents covering the SmartCycler technology.  Other interested parties may submit questions and/or qualifications statements by Close of Business March 23, 2009.

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent for sole source procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (FAR 13) and Other Than Full and Open competition (FAR 6.302-1).&nbsp; A solicitation will be issued.&nbsp; The associated NAICS Code is 518210.&nbsp; The Naval Special Warfare Group ONE Contracting Office intends to award a sole source contract for the contract effor for Special Warfare Automated Logistics Information System (SWALIS) support to AMSEC LLC.&nbsp; Based on FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.&nbsp; The highly complex program management and software development required for the continued deployment of the SWALIS enterprise solution for NSWC demands stability of performance that can only be successfully accomplished through direct contract support due to the very limited Government staff available.&nbsp; Under Phase 1 SWALIS contract, and the web enabled Table of Allowance contract, AMSEC LLC, provided NSWC with SWALIS customized software development and system deployment services.&nbsp; The next phase of SWALIS development and deployment incorporates legacy data conversion, which must be completed by December 2009 and the full technology insertion into all identified functional areas in a global enterprise arena by 2012.&nbsp; With the implementation of SWALIS currently underway and the shift away from manual, antiquated processes, it is critical that there be continuity of technical, business and program support, which the current contractor (AMSEC LLC) has been providing for the past 36 months.&nbsp; Period of Performance is Base year plus two option years (March 2009 through March 2012). This notice is not a request for competitive quotes, however, any firm that believes that they can meet the above SWALIS support requirements may give written notice via email to the contracting officer.&nbsp; Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; The Government anticipates an award date of March 18, 2009.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with the authority contained in FAR 6.302.1, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with DecisionTek, LLC of Rockville, Maryland for Phase III follow-on work to supplement the Generalized Train Movement Simulator (GTMS) software developed previously by the firm. Under Phase III, the GTMS software will be augmented to be a comprehensive stand along too designed to support analyses of safety regulatory requirements with a particular emphasis on exposure to accident risk associated with the implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) systems. The Phase III GTMS will introduce failure probabilities, including the probability of human error, to the Phase II GTMS Platform. The augmented system will simulate railroad safe operations, accidents, and rare events over a 20-year time horizon and generate a full set of operational and safety metrics including probability density functions. Statistical methods to be utilized will generate robust results and optimize computer run times. This is not a competitive and no written solicitation is available.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Accelrys, Inc. 10188 Telesis Ct., Ste. 100, San Diego, CA to provide software maintenance for the period of April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010 for DMOL3 and MS Visualizer Software licenses that are currently in used at NIST. The key feature for performance and function are the numerical atom-centered basis sets, which allow the same level of theory to be used for small organic molecules as for solids and surfaces. Other solid state codes that use a planewave basis set require very high-energy cutoffs, large memory, and long computation time that make describing molecular adsorption and hydrogen problematic and inefficient. No other commercial code has numerical basis sets. DMOL3 is also an all electron code, and does not require the use of less accurate pseudopotentials or muffin tins to describe core electrons, NIST also requires that the results be accessible through the Cerius2 and Materials Studio visualizers and interface software, which NIST already has in-house. DMOL3 is NIST’s primary computational instrument, and NIST had been using it for more than six (6) years to generate results.  NIST needs to be able to compare the numerical results from new calculations with the old DMOL3 results, otherwise NIST has to repeat years of worth of work because of difference between methods. No other vendor offers DMOL3 or the MS Visualizer. Product meets all applicable 508 standards. 
A firm-fixed-price purchase order will be issued on or about March 20, 2009, The Government intends to solicit on this one source under the authority FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested concerns may identify their capabilities to provide renewal of these licenses by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to provide the required license renewals. Capability statements may be emailed to Janice.Moten@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procedure. This noticed is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Research and development efforts at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) have lead to the capability for testing and developing closed Brayton cycles including supercritical Brayton cycles for power production. This technology for producing electrical power can be driven by a nuclear reactor, a solar receiver, a natural gas, geo-thermal or coal flame or other sources of thermal energy.  Two Brayton cycles have been assembled, are operating, and are available for testing.  One is a low pressure Brayton cycle that operates up to 900 K and has a compressor inlet pressure that is near one atmosphere. The other is a supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle and compression loop that is being used at compressor inlet presures up to 1300 psia and maximum pressures to 2200 psia.  Concepts, and prototype control algorithms, and dynamic system models also have been developed for both systems.

This synopsis of intent is to give notice of the Governments intent to make a sole source modification to increase capacity of a current award.  Contractors who can provide the U. S Army Engineering and Support Center with the services, in accordance with the synopsis listed below, are invited to submit electronically an affirmative written response indicating a bona fide ability to meet this specific requirement.  <BR><BR>The Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) contracts were awarded under full and open competition to four small businesses for the issuance of fixed-price task orders.  The contracts are providing support to the Army Training Facility Program Office (ATFPO) including infrastructure and training planning studies, MILCON projects justification programming and NEPA documentation, investment strategies and related planning support services.  Since the award of these contracts, the Army Training Facility Program Office (ATFPO) has been assigned Army-wide missions in support of Army Modularity Facilities (AMF), Global Stationing Initiative (GSI); Grow the Army (GTA) initiatives, and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).  These additional requirements have significantly increased the workload and contract dependence for the Huntsville Center in its critical support to the Army in transformation.  <BR><BR>The ATFPO is in need of the continuous core of essential program support services, technical assistance, and oversight support provided through these contracts.  The expertise developed under these contracts provides program customers with timely infrastructure and training planning studies, investment strategies, and related planning support services.  There are no other contracts available within the Huntsville Center to support such broad master planning and MILCON programming tasks.  Use of other Engineering District contracts has been investigated and found that their contract capacity will not support the projected ATFPO workload, in addition to their own support to internal customers.  It is critical that the ATFPO has sufficient support to execute the magnitude of planning and programming actions resulting from the Army Re-stationing and BRAC master planning and MILCON programming requirements.  The added mission assigned to ATFPO, to provide centralized management in the execution of all master planning and MILCON programming missions within accelerated timelines, was not foreseen or anticipated by the Huntsville Center.    <BR><BR>Responses should appear on company letterhead and include, at a minimum, affirmation of active registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), your Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number, any applicable processed credentials and qualifications, and any applicable pricing data or information.  All responses should include a point of contact, telephone number, and electronic address.  Additionally, respondents should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUB Zone, service disabled veteran-owned small business, or qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned.  Responses to this notice of intent will be used to determine the availability of this type of service.  All responsible sources may respond to this synopsis and all responses will be considered by the agency.<BR><BR>Responses should be furnished electronically by 10:00 A.M.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, intends to negotiate a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source to KayPENTAX, a division of Pentax Medical Company for Audiology /Speech Pathology equipment (complete digital strobe). This equipment includes DICOM software which would allow for the capability of images from the evaluations done on this equipment to be transferred into Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) / Veterans Health Information Systems & Technology Architecture (VISTA) IMAGING. There is no other known source that provides this equipment with DICOM software. This equipment integrates with 6 fiberoptic endoscopes that are currently in use, which can be used with this system. The integration and compatibility of equipment allows for more efficient patient care as our clinicians are already trained and familiar with this equipment and it allows for the most optimal situation for obtaining quality images during evaluations.The advanced laryngeal imaging system will digitally record stroboscopic and other endoscopic exams to a fully-integrated video capture and playback workstation. It will include a high quality imaging system for comprehensive assessment of the vocal folds' structure and vibratory characteristics. It can also be used to record other endoscopic procedures (e.g., transnasal esophagoscopy) with superior image quality. A firm fixed price contract with no option years is anticipated and shall be awarded. It is the Government's belief that only the proposed candidate possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement. It is the Government's intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source.This is not a request for proposal.  However, companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include technical, specifications of their product, pass performance information, price and delivery time.  This information will be reviewed by the Government technical representatives for consideration for future requirements.  Email statements are preferred.  Statements are due no later than March 13, 2009.  Phone inquiries will not be accepted.This is not a solicitation; it is a Notice of Intent to Sole Source requirement.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24. The acquisition will be processed as a small business set aside. The associated NAICS code is 335311.</p>
<p>2. Respondents to this Request for Proposal (RFP) should submit a fact sheet and a bid for ten (10) each of the 117G batteries with the attributes listed on Attachment 1 to this RFP package. Each battery shall include the standard available warranty. Please state what is included in the standard warranty. In addition, please state if higher level warranties are available, what they entail, and the costs associated with those warranties. In the event that this office determines to purchase a higher level warranty, that warranty will be included as a separate CLIN in the contract.</p>
<p>3. In addition, we are soliciting a quote for an additional buy of up to 1300 117G batteries. These will be purchased as funding becomes available. Therefore, all offerors shall propose any quantity discount(s) available, and what the minimum order is to receive any quantity discount.</p>
<p>4. In addition, the Government may also be interested in procuring a battery charger to be used with the 117G battery. The charger specification is also listed in the specification sheet attached to the model contract. At the present, this is only an option which the Government will evaluate, but may or may not purchase at the present time. The total number for the charger option will be 650. Please include all possible quantity discounts with the cost of this option.</p>
<p>5. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is incorporated and the Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. As indicated on the attached Standard Form 1449, award will be made on the basis of a simplified trade-off. In this instance, technical selection criteria will be of greater importance than cost. The Government will also evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s) and general statements that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well-known techniques will be used, or paraphrases of the RFP specification in whole or in part will not constitute compliance with this requirement concerning the content of the technical requirement. Offerors shall complete and submit with each proposal FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items and DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

The solicitation number is AG-0120-S-09-0016 and this solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30.  This is a small business set-aside with an associated NAICS code of 441222 and small business size standard of $7 million dollars.

The following are this solicitation’s list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure:
0001 – 21 foot jet boat – brand name or equal to Sportjon by Phantom
0002 – 200 HP inboard engine
0003 – Trailer sized for the boat
0004 – Shipping/Handling to Cordova, AK 99574

Description of requirements for the items to be acquired.  
The following are salient physical, functional or performance characteristics of the brand name item that an equal item must meet to be acceptable for award:
UHMW BOTTOM:  This is a hull bottom covering that allows a boat to operate more efficiently in VERY shallow water, protects the hull from damage and reduces fuel consumption.

BOAT DESIGN THAT ALLOWS FOR THE MAJORITY OF CARGO TO BE STORED IN BOW OF BOAT:  The boat design should have close to ½ of the haul forward of the console.  This haul design assists in distribution of weight and balance while running and allowing the boat to travel safely in VERY shallow water.  It also increases the comfort and safety for passengers by separating passengers and cargo.

DUEL CONSOLE AND DUEL WINDSHIELDS THAT HINGE DOWN:  The windshields need to hinge down to protect glass from breaking while running in narrow streams and trailering the boat over gravel roads.

DRY WEIGHT OF 1,500 LBS OR LESS:  This is an important item considering the conditions in which this boat needs to run.  This boat needs to run in very shallow sloughs and streams as well as deep fast moving water.  If the boat becomes stuck in shallow water it needs to be light enough for a couple of people to move it into deeper water.  When running in deeper/faster water and loaded with people and gear this boat needs to be light and maneuverable as possible to quickly react to changing water conditions.

TUNNEL HULL,
A 20 TO 22 FOOT LENGTH.
A 91 TO 94 INCH BEAM.
A 200HP INBOARD JET ENGINE.
INSULATED ENGINE BOX TO REDUCE ENGINE NOISE.
A 1,500 LB WEIGHT CAPACITY OR BETTER.
PERSON CAPACITY OF FIVE (5)
CANVAS CANOPY COVERING SEATING AREA.
A 40 GALLON FUEL CAPACITY.
SAND TRAP.
STOMP GRATE:  This is for lower unit clean out.
FUEL FILTER/WATER SEPERATION SYSTEM.
BOAT TRAILER SIZED FOR THE ABOVE DESCRIBED BOAT.
The Forest Service needs a boat that can safely transport crews and material on the very dynamic Copper River Corridor.  This boat needs to be big enough to move larger crews and gear, light enough to travel in very shallow water, maneuverable and powerful enough to transition from slow/shallow water to deep/fast water and conservative with fuel consumption due to the long distances/remote locations on the Copper River.

The date for delivery is 90 days after receipt of order.  Shipping terms are FOB Destination.

CLIN 0001: National Archives Participation in the National Hispanic Internship Program .

Description (1) Background and Scope; The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has a critical need to expand its recruitment presence in the Hispanic community.  NARA’s Strategic Plan calls for NARA to strive toward increasing the percentages of NARA employees in underrepresented groups to match their respective availability levels in the civilian labor force.  Currently, Hispanics comprise only 1.3 percent of NARA’s workforce and traditional recruitment methods alone are not enough to address this problem. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed Federal agencies to look to alternative sources for Hispanic applicants.  

In an effort to meet the expectations set forth in the Strategic Plan, NARA is seeking to partner with an internship organization that can assist NARA in expanding its outreach in the Hispanic community.  Specifically, NARA is seeking assistance in filling fifteen (15) vacant intern positions for the summer 2009.  The internships will focus on locating, researching, and organizing archival documents and records of particular interest to Hispanic communities.  Interns must meet the following qualifications:

•	Be currently enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program in an archives or related field of study (e.g., history, library and information science, museum studies, etc.);
•	Be a student in good academic standing as defined by the college or university in which the student is enrolled;
•	Demonstrated experience and/or interest in the archival field or related profession.
•	Be available for a ten-week period beginning June 8, 2009.

The partner organization must be able to provide the following services: 

•	Market NARA internship opportunities to eligible applicants;
•	Identify, recruit, evaluate, and process applicants for identified NARA internship positions;
•	Facilitate travel and housing arrangements for the selected interns;
•	Provide a structured program of academic and social activities to supplement the internship experience;
•	Provide ongoing counseling and programmatic support to the interns throughout their internship experience.

The partner organization must be able to provide these services within sufficient time to meet the start date of the NARA summer internship program: June 8, 2009.  In particular, intern applications and other relevant materials must be available for NARA to review by March 24, 2009 in order to allow sufficient time for the interview and selection process.


The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant purchase order: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jun 2008); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (Feb 2009)-contractors shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the contractor has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>Then National Institute of Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Illumina; 9885 Towne Center Drive, San Diego, California.  The Laboratory of Neurogenetics has an Illumina Genome Analyzer which allows the lab   to generate highly accurate results in under a week for discoveries in genomics, epigenomics, gene expression analysis, and protein-nucleic acid interactions.  This sophisticated equipment requires frequent visits from service technicians to ensure the Genome Analyzer is functioning properly.  This allows the lab to continue obtaining consistent data and results for the many experiments conducted.  The Lab of Neurogenetics cannot use another vendor to service this equipment as complex as the genome analyzer.  This service requires a certified Illimina service tech for visits to perform many tasks including; troubleshoot problems, install new software upgrades, train staff, and perform preventive maintenance.  Due to frequent visits and the cost for replacements parts it is in the Governments best interest to continue the warranty on the Genome Analyzer with Illumina.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurement requirements.
Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The period of performance is for 1 year.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 811219 and the Standard Size is 6.5.

<DESC>This is a study of the safety impact of traffic management techniques. The objective is to determine the safety impact of these techniques and to recommend approaches that can be taken in designing traffic management techniques that minimize safety risks using advanced traffic simulation models, historical data to analyze the safety impacts of changes in weaving movements resulting from dedicated traffic lanes, and reductions in truck-car lane sharing due to truck only lanes.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” or the “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the “Invoice” option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(l) Reserved<br />(End of Provision)<br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  

Informal forum with the Ombudsman
Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman
Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. (End of clause) Alternate I (Oct 2008). When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i) and (l) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. (4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may- (A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. (e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

(iii) Materials means- (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control; (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); (D) The following subcontracts for services which are specifically excluded from the hourly rate: [Insert any subcontracts for services to be excluded from the hourly rates prescribed in the schedule.]; and (E) Indirect costs specifically provided for in this clause. (iv) Subcontract means any contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, entered into with a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of the prime contract or a subcontract including transfers between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor.

Payment shall be made for services accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery destination(s) set forth in this contract. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: (i) Hourly rate. (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis.      (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated.      (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.      (3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. (ii) Materials. (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the- (1) Quantities being acquired; and      (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor-      (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert 'None'."] (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert "$0" if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert 'None')."] 2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment- (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); (B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures; (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost- (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall- (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the- (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); (B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; (C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and (D) Contractor point of contact. (ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.

The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if- (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2). (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on- (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.

(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.

<DESC>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: •	Program name •	Government or contractor POC •	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. •	Date & period of performance •	Cost of effort •	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, we’re looking for ways to implement a “throttle”  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources  must respond with a complete Request for Information package of no more  than 10 pages though, providing everything requested above. All parties  are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, an e-mail  address, and a facsimile number in their response. This information should be sent electronically to Mr Rick Fennell at  ricky.fennell@wpafb.af.mil.  Responses should be received no later than 15  March 2007.

(b) Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: •	Program name •	Government or contractor POC •	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. •	Date & period of performance •	Cost of effort •	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, we’re looking for ways to implement a “throttle”  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources  must respond with a complete Request for Information package of no more  than 10 pages though, providing everything requested above. All parties  are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, an e-mail  address, and a facsimile number in their response. This information should be sent electronically to Mr Rick Fennell at  ricky.fennell@wpafb.af.mil.  Responses should be received no later than 15  March 2007.

<DESC><p>NOTIFICATION:&nbsp; THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN SET ASIDE FOR COMPETITION AMONG 8(a) CERTIFIED FIRMS NATIONWIDE.&nbsp; THIS NOTIFICATION IS PROVIDED FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND COMPANIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO SUBMIT ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR PROVIDE ANY RESPONSE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Original Posting:&nbsp;</p>
<p>This request is an announcement for information for planning purposes only. This sources sought does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Request for Quote, or Invitation for Bid. Nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government's acquisition approach.</p>
<p><br />The Air Force Technical Application Center (AFTAC) is seeking interested sources for Phase 4 (P4) of the US National Data Center (US NDC) program. The US NDC is the geophysical data acquisition, data processing, reporting and archiving component of the United States Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS) operated by the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC). AFTAC's mission is to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties to standards set by US verification and policy leaders. This mission requires the US NDC to detect, locate and identify foreign nuclear tests and provide rapid reporting and technical assessment to the appropriate national security agencies and policy makers. The US NDC processes and integrates data and information up to and including the Department of Defense (DoD) SECRET level. The US NDC also serves as the data distribution center for all US government and authorized users for International Monitoring System (IMS) data. The focus of this phase is to add increased functionality to the current baseline, fine-tune current systems by increasing performance level, upgrade existing hardware, and sustain the present operational systems.</p>
<p><br />The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data acquisition and processing system which provides the capability to receive, process, archive and report events of interest in monitoring nuclear treaty requirements. It acquires waveform data from a global network of seismic, hydroacoustic and infrasonic stations. Data is stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external to AFTAC, and reliably forwarded to a classified processing system. The US NDC receives data from the International Data Center (IDC) originating from International Monitoring System (IMS) sensors on U.S. territory and from other countries. Users interactively review, refine, correct, and display currently available results.</p>
<p><br />The US NDC consists of the following components: (a) A 24x7 operations center located in the AFTAC Operations Center (AOC), Patrick AFB, FL (PAFB); (b) A 24x7 alternate (ALT) hot-backup system located at Goodfellow AFB, TX (GAFB); (c) A Training System located at the 312th Training Squadron GAFB; (d) A Remote Operations Center (ROC) located at PAFB (used to support unplanned and/or short term AOC outages, fire drills, etc.); (e) The US NDC Sustainment System (SUS, aka the test-bed) and (f) the US NDC Development System (DEVL), both located at AFTAC/PAFB.</p>
<p><br />Current System Parameters include the following:</p>
<p><br />1) Hardware: SUN SPARC-based servers and workstations, Storage area network drives, LTO3 tape archives<br />2) Software: Solaris 8 &amp; 10, Oracle 10g<br />3) Code: C, C++, FORTRAN, PERL, Scheme, SQL, Lisp, ASM, CSH, Java, Makefile, SH, TCL, YACC</p>
<p><br />The operational US NDC hardware (OPS, Alt, Training System, and Remote Operations Center) along with most of the development/sustainment hardware is and will continue to be maintained through a separate AFTAC maintenance support contract.</p>
<p><br />Contractor responsibility will include the development and integration of a total system including ongoing upgrades, advanced geophysical studies and tuning/optimization of software algorithms. All personnel must have a Secret clearance and all key personnel must have a Top Secret (SCI) clearance. A majority of the work will be done within the AFTAC building at Patrick AFB, FL. Therefore, the contractor must have or establish a facility in Florida and have key personnel available to work within AFTAC.</p>
<p>Examples of new and ongoing US NDC development and sustainment items include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p><br />1) One of the primary objectives of the Phase 4 effort is to provide a software and hardware architecture with implementation which will provide the platform for future system growth and enhancements. The functionality shall maintain and enhance existing data acquisition, detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation, event classification, event reporting, data distribution, and data archiving capabilities to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs as specified in the US NDC System Requirements Document (SRD).</p>
<p><br />2) A second major objective of the P4 effort is to make use of modern, object-oriented (OO) software design and development practices to re-architect the US NDC's legacy source code/software baseline that has evolved over the past 15+ years. The most immediate need/target is the interactive analysis tool suite.</p>
<p><br />3) Integration of 3rd party efforts: The Department of Energy (DoE) and Air Force labs, as well as various government contractors are involved in numerous areas of US NDC development. Some examples are: portions of the knowledge base, event classification methodology, and Geographical Information System (GIS). It will be the prime contractor's responsibility to team with these AFTAC partners and integrate their products.</p>
<p><br />4) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing Total System Integration Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC. The US NDC contractor is responsible for integration of hardware, COTS/GOTS software and calibration information, and contractor developed software into the US NDC system.</p>
<p><br />5) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing 24x7 on call support to insure 99% operational availability rate.</p>
<p><br />6) The US NDC contractor participates as a key member of the US NDC Change Management Board (CMB) to insure the US NDC will continue to meet the operational availability requirements. The CMB oversees the US NDC Change Request (CR) process and prioritizes O&amp;M work which includes but is not limited to software bug fixes and minor enhancements, adding new stations to data acquisition and both station and network processing.</p>
<p><br />7) Studies<br />a) Conduct scientific studies to help improve detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation and event classification to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs.<br />b) Conduct engineering and IT infrastructure studies (e.g., hardware, software, databases) to help improve overall system performance and help reduce maintenance costs and man power needs.<br />All applicable upgrades to the US NDC shall also be made to the training system, and to the Alt US NDC, both of which are located at Goodfellow AFB TX.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. It is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources. Interested parties responding to this announcement shall provide a point of contact, their company's Cage Code, and indicate their company's business size (i.e. large, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBzone, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), or woman-owned small business) in relation to NAICS Code 541511, size standard $25 million. The Government reserves the right to set this action aside for a type of small business concern.</p>

<DESC><p>This notice is posted pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 5.2 -- Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions.</p>
<p>The 61st Contracting Squadron, Los Angeles Air Force Base (LAAFB), CA intends to solicit for a follow-on contract for Engineering and Environmental Services. It is anticipated this will be a Commercial Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) type contract with Cost Reimbursement line items. This proposed contract is being considered as a set-aside under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 541330, Engineering Services. The size standard for NAICS 541330 is $4M. The government is interested in all small businesses including (8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that are interested in performing this requirement. The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business) anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision.&rdquo; Required contract work includes a broad range of services. Examples include customer support services; planning and engineering services; environmental services, design, construction management, cost estimating, and real property maintenance. Service areas include the main LAAFB installation in El Segundo, CA, Fort MacArthur, Pacific Crest, and Pacific Heights in San Pedro, CA, the Carson Annex in Carson, CA and Camp Parks in Dublin, CA (all Contractor manpower shall work out of the main base in El Segundo, but may be required to perform temporary services at other LAAFB properties). The contract is anticipated to begin 15 July 2009 with a 20 day transition period (25 June &ndash; 14 July 2009). The basic period of performance is anticipated to be one year (15 July 2009 &ndash; 14 July 2010), with up to 4 one-year options.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has a requirement for a Real Estate Professional to offer comprehensive office leasing advisory and brokerage services for the procurement of OCC Headquarters office space in accordance with applicable Federal procedures, following the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and General Services Acquisition Management Regulation (GSAM).   The Real Estate Professional will provide services as a Pre-solicitation Consultation and Solicitation Brokerage to the Leasing Contracting Officer for the Real Estate and Capital Assets Department throughout the acquisition process.  OCC’s headquarters is currently located in Southwest Washington, DC, occupies one entire building and multiple locations in nearby buildings.  OCC expects to occupy a new, consolidated headquarters location in the 500,000 square foot range in 2014 and the option to lease an additional approximately 40,000 square foot facility. See http://www.occ.treas.gov for more information. It is mandatory that the primary contact for the project possess both extensive federal government and private sector real property leasing experience for large procurements.  Thorough knowledge and extensive experience with GSA forms and complying with the appropriate procurement regulations, as well as negotiating large private sector leases and government leasing transactions in the Washington, DC area within the past two years is essential.  As needed, the contractor shall furnish qualified personnel, equipment; and facilities to complete the tasks under the contract.  The contractor shall make a full disclosure to OCC of any potential conflicts of interest.  The Contractor must work out of office space within the Washington, DC Metropolitan Area and be able to respond to the Lease Contracting Officer (LCO) within 24 hours (one work day) during the day-to-day performance of this contract.  Responding to the LCO shall be defined as written (via facsimile) or electronic (i.e., e-mail) if person-to-person verbal communication is not possible.  The acquisition strategy entails the award of a firm fixed price type of contract including a base year and four additional one-year option periods. The Contracting Officer has made a determination that FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and Part 15 (Contracting by Negotiations) is the appropriate method of procuring this requirement.  Technical proposals will be evaluated base on Key Personnel Experience, Strategic Acquisition Plan, and Past Performance of the Project Team in all comparable transactions performed within the last five (5) years for the Organization, and the Commission split with OCC.

Offerors may submit proposals for any, or all, items.  The applicable NAICS code is 236220 – Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The small business size standard is $33.5 million in average annual receipts. The government will proceed to issue a solicitation under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, for a commercial service (routine alteration & repair).  This solicitation is a 100% set-aside for small business concerns.  Offerors will be evaluated on price, experience, and past performance.  Experience and past performance are as important as price.  Contract award will be to the offeror(s) whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the best value to the government. The government total estimated value is between $250,000 and $500,000.  

Payment protection is required for awarded contracts equal to, or greater than $30,000.00 and less than $100,000.00.

In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.

<DESC>Contract N68936-04-D-0019 Tybrin Corporation is one of three Multiple-Award Contracts (MAC's) for Combat Environment Simulation (CES) support at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA.  NAWCWD intends to negotiate on an other-than-competitive basis an extension of the contract ordering period from May 31, 2009 to September 30, 2009.  Contract N68936-04-D-0019 is one of three CPAF, IDIQ, level-of-efforts multi-award contracts supporting CES.  The other two CES MAC's are N68936-04-D-0020 with Lockheed Martin Services and N68936-04-D-0022 with L-3 Services Inc., Global Security & Engineering Solutions (L-3 GSES).  The purpose of the modification is to increase the ceiling and extend the ordering period of the contract.  The current level-of-effort for the contract is 568,922 hours.  The level-of-effort will be increased by approximately 33,715 hours for the contract.  The work is competed among the multi-award contracts at the order level using best value source selection processes.  An increase to the ceiling for Contract N68936-04-D-0019 is necessary in order to modify existing orders on the contract to meet program needs until follow-on multiple award contracts c! an be awarded.  The extension is needed to avoid work stoppage on existing programs until the follow-on solicitation can be released and awards made from it.  Contractors who believe that they can step in and take over a program must submit a written response demonstrating technical, cost and management capability without causing hardships to program schedule and costs.  No new work requirements are planned for the current contracts and orders.  Requirements are competed among the CES MAC's and awarded and funded at the task/delivery order level.  NAWCWD is currently developing the follow-on requirement.  NAWCWD anticipates the follow-on contracts will be Cost Plus Award Fee /IDIQ/level-of-effort type contracts with five year ordering period, no options.  The follow-on requirement is also known as CES III.  New requirements are intended for competition among those contractors selected for CES III.  The Combat Environment Simulation (CES) Division at China Lake requires supp! ort to develop and acquire new range systems, integrate various range systems and upgrade and modernize existing range systems.  Specifically, there are requirements for the integration of various T&E and training systems into existing range systems and infrastructure; the fielding of systems at new range locations; the modification/update/upgrade of major software systems, and the development, modification, or integration of supporting range systems and assets (for participants tracking, data communications, exercise monitoring, and debrief, etc.). The CES Division also requires a variety of engineering, technical and management services related to development, fabrication, procurement, integration, test, training and technical support of radar and pod instrumentation systems, EO/IR/MW/UV/Laser/C4I Threat Simulator systems, tactical training ranges for all DoD services, related network-centric systems and components, Advanced Air Defense technological concepts, Information Assurance/Operations, Artificial Intelligence, and Neural Networking i! n a Network Centric Warfare environment.  As required by specific task orders, the contractor shall design, develop, fabricate, install, integrate, and test network-centric warfare equipment and/or systems designed to provide a dense, realistic, electromagnetic  (radio frequency, infrared, electro-optic, and laser energy) environment to be used by the Defense community for weapon systems development, real-time aircrew tactical training, test and evaluation, test and evaluation of defense suppression systems, electronic warfare (EW) systems, electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment, and electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) equipment.  These efforts will include fixed and moving ground, sea, and air targets, multi-lateration and GPS-based instrumentation pods, threat emitters, integrated hardware/software systems and environments and hostile equipment modeled entirely in software.  The contractor shall install and integrate the systems and equipment on test and evaluat! ion ranges and training ranges.    Because of the synergistic nature of the CES Division's product and the thrust to emphasize commonality and joint interpretability across all Department of Defense (DoD) ranges, the body of projects executed by this division take on the look and feel of a single unified acquisition.  Level of facility clearance required: SECRET.  Level of safeguarding required: SECRET.  Contractor's interested in subcontracting opportunities contact the Prime Contractor.  All responsible sources, that submit a proposal, shall be considered by the Agency.  The anticipated award date of the modification: May 14, 2009.  Questions should be addressed to Commander Code 220000D, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, 429 East Bowen Road - Stop 4105, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.

<DESC><p>Pre-solicitation Notice Description: NAICS &ndash; 562910. General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting competitive proposals for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for Asbestos Abatement, Greater Southwest Region (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas). This procurement is a set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVO). This procurement is an Indefinite Quantity Contract for Asbestos Abatement in Government-owned, GSA controlled or leased buildings in various counties/parishes in the Greater Southwest Region (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas). The Asbestos Abatement IDIQ Contract is for a period of one (1) year from Notice to Proceed, with four 1-year options, not to exceed five years. The maximum ordering limitation is up to $1,500,000.00 (One Million Five Hundred Thousand) per year. The guaranteed minimum shall be $500.00 per each one-year period. A bid guarantee will be required in the amount of $200,000.00. THE SUCCESSFUL FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ALL LOCATIONS WITHIN THE GREATER SOUTHWEST REGION (ARKANSAS, LOUISIANA, OKLAHOMA, NEW MEXICO, AND TEXAS). See ATTACHMENT A &ndash; City Listing(s), includes but is not limited to the cities listed. The successful firm shall have the capability to perform work at several sites simultaneously and to handle large projects. More than one project may be in progress at any one given time or location during the term of the contract. The successful firm shall have the capability to respond rapidly on an emergency as-needed basis for the Greater Southwest Region (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas). This negotiated procurement will be accomplished by using source selection procedures, which will result in award of a firm fixed price contract to the contractor offering the best value to the Government. Technical ability is significantly more important than price. Work includes all asbestos abatement (construction) activities, but may require the contractor to make site surveys, to provide determination for confirmation of asbestos scope of work on site, to take bulk samples of suspected asbestos containing materials (i.e., ACM), and prepare reports on the results of the site surveys. The work will primarily require asbestos workers, building laborers, carpenters, lathers, plasterers, insulators, truck drivers, industrial hygienists and other disciplines with specialized experience. Projects will primarily involve asbestos abatement, but may also include selective demolition and/or restoration, including re-insulation, reinstallation of ceiling, lighting, etc. The successful contractor must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a licensed asbestos abatement contractor in at least one or more of the following states: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. All work performed under this contract shall be performed by licensed asbestos abatement parties (either a Prime Contractor and/or Key Subcontractor) that is licensed in the state and/or municipality in which the work is to be performed. Proof of licensing and of the requisite experience will be verified prior to awarding a contract, or any delivery order issued under the contract. The Government may or may not hold discussions on technical proposals (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a); therefore, the offeror&rsquo;s proposal should contain the offeror&rsquo;s best terms from a technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government is not limited to contacting only those references provided by the offeror. The Government may also consider the offeror&rsquo;s performance on contracts not submitted by the offeror that the Government is aware of, or becomes aware of. Technical factors are listed in descending order of importance. Experience and Past Performance is significantly greater in importance than each of the remaining factors. (1) Experience and Past Performance of Prime Contractor and Key Subcontractors; (2) Experience, Past Performance and Qualifications of Key Personnel; (3) Management and Technical Approach. Offerors will not be reimbursed for proposal submittal expenses. The Government furnished line item listing in this contract will be the primary ordering source. If the awarded contractor refuses to accept work for any line item included in a task order issued under this IDIQ contract the Government will deem this to be a material breach of the contract and may terminate the contract for cause, without additional expense to the Government. Any documents related to this procurement will be available via the Internet only. No hard copies will be available. Contractors are responsible for downloading their own copy of all documents. These documents will be in .pdf(Adobe Acrobat) format and will be available at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about March 12, 2009. It is the contractor&rsquo;s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any information or documents in the special notices, the solicitation and amendments, if any. Contractors can also register to be notified by e-mail of new postings including synopsis, solicitations, and amendments at the site. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. We encourage contractors to periodically check the site; it is the contractor&rsquo;s responsibility to make sure you have all of the documents related to the procurement. This procurement is being made under the Small Business Demonstration Program. ATTACHMENT A - City Listings Includes, but is not limited to the following cities.

<DESC>RESPONSE TO QUESTION:
Q: Can we use another chiller manufacturer instead of Trane for the Carson City Chiller Replacement Project (Solicitation GS-09P-09-KSC-0049)?
A:  A Trane chiller was used as the basis of design.  However this is a "Trane or equivalent" specification.  The selection will be considered in the evaluation, to include sources of maintenance and the degree and impact of having to use multiple sources of maintenance (the remaining unit is a Trane), which will be weighed against price.  Offerors are invivted to submit alternate proposals, each of which will be considered.

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The Corps received the following Question:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Note 1. Drawings C-109, C-110, C-111 allows the USACE to change the size of the borrow areas. How is the contractor to estimate the amount of material available from each area if you can change the size of the area?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is possible that the contractor could estimate using the main channel area, Deadman's Slough, and head of raft channel only to find out that only 50% of the required volume is now available and the rest must come from the above Brownsville site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The cost for dredging each of these areas is vastly different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Response: There is enough information in the plans (bathymetry, cut dimension, typical section) for the contractor to calculate quantities available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Based on current information - we have estimated that there is enough material in the main channel cut to build all the islands in the contract. Depending on the approach, the contractors may or may not want to use the other cuts. We have not provided estimates for each cut, as conditions can change at any time. We do not know if the selected contractor will want to dredge from the Above Brownsville site, but we left that in as an acceptable source of material. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The areas are identified as suitable areas for granular material and amounts available are based on the best information currently available regarding bathymetry. The notes on the plans identify those areas that may be dredged prior to construction and for which estimated quantities may change.</span></p>
