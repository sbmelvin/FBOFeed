<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.</p>
<p>Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<br />Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.</p>
<p>20. Buyer name, phone#, and email address Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer James Headington, 405-855-3535, James.Headington.1@us.af.mil.</p>

<SUBJECT>NEW GENERAL A&E IDIQ CONTRACT
<SOLNBR>140R1018R0035
<CONTACT>Cooper, Scott
<DESC>The Pacific Northwest Regional Office (PN Region) of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation intends to award two Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to provide General Architectural and Engineering (AE) services for the Pacific Northwest Region.   The term for each contract is five years.  The total value of each contract shall not exceed $25,000,000.00.  The minimum guarantee is $20,000.00 in the first year only. The contract ceiling price is $25,000,000.00. 
The scope of these contracts is to provide general engineering services to support a variety of Reclamation programs. These contracts will primarily require intensive civil, electrical, hydraulic, and mechanical engineering expertise. Additionally, expertise in architecture, environmental, natural, physical and social sciences, planning, economics, and cost estimating will be required.
Based upon the projected work, the focus for these contracts will be to provide support for several large, complex, multi-year projects.  These projects will require firms with extensive backgrounds in hydropower, civil, mechanical and electrical engineering with staffing levels capable of concurrently working on multiple large task orders.

<DESC>NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING SPECIALIST.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

This is a market survey for information and comments from industry that will aid in the formation of an acquisition strategy for the acquisition of Extron branded or equivalent components for the technical refresh of the Detroit area video wall in support of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The draft requirements are identified in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).

At this time, the Extron brand is the only brand known that will suffice for the requirements of this acquisition.

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor’s expense.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest, capabilities, and rough orders of magnitude (cost estimates) from businesses interested in and capable of providing the required Extron brand or equivalent components per the Statement of Work (SOW). Respondents to this Market Survey are encouraged to provide comments regarding the government’s approach to this requirement.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the potential acquisition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards for this effort:

NAICS – 334310, Audio and Video Equipment Manufacturing
Size Standard – 750 Employees

Interested firms are required to submit a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

The FAA requires interested vendors to address the requirements in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). This document is provided for feedback and comments.

Each vendor should include the following information along with their submission:

1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:

- Type of supplies and services that are Extron branded or similar provided by your firm (if an alternative to Extron brand, please send information regarding the alternative (i.e.: brand, model / part numbers, specifications, how the item is similar, etc.)

- Size and type of Extron / alternative brand supplies provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance)

- Number of years in business

2. Clearly state whether or not you can provide all of the types of supplies listed in the draft SOW.

3. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

4. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) or budgetary estimate for the items described in the draft SOW.

All responses to this market survey must be received by 5:00 p.m. Central Time (Oklahoma Time) on January 18, 2018.

The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following:

Email: bill.white@faa.gov

If email is your method of submission, please include "MARKET SURVEY RESPONSE: Detroit Area Video Wall Tech Refresh” in the subject line of your email.

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Description</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) plans to solicit proposals under <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">full and open competition </strong>procedures from offerors having the capability to provide services that will increase the availability of post-mortem human brain tissue for research. The NIH intends to support multiple awardees/collection sites in order to provide sufficient critical resources for research on neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The objective is to make awards to offerors that can acquire at least 50 donors per year (with the possibility of up to 200 unique human donors per year for a range of 250 &ndash; 1,000 by the end of the five-year contract period, if all option periods are exercised).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Qualified offerors will be required to acquire specimens, document and maintain a current inventory by entering data on the donors and tissue samples into a third-party interactive website (Section 508 compliant) herein referred to as the NIH NeuroBioBank Portal, and participate in the sharing of tissue(s) and associated data under the NIH NeuroBioBank guidelines. The NIH NeuroBioBank Portal will facilitate tissue requests and coordinate the distribution from the various brain banks to qualified scientific investigators who are dedicated to the improved understanding, treatment, and prevention of these disorders; (see NIMH, NINDS, NICHD, NIDA and NIA for areas of disease focus). Various types of deliverables will be required including a collection of brain tissue and biospecimens, data, and reports. The anticipated contracts will include Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and protocols to ensure uniformity among sites when possible, and Quality Assurance/Quality Control requirements for prospective evaluation of short- and long-term specimen integrity, viability and function.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Qualified offerors should have the ability to:</span></p>

Tissue shall be collected in accordance with all applicable state and local laws and federal regulations. Tissue acquired will be primarily focused on the postmortem brain, but other nervous system tissues from individuals with neurodevelopmental, neurological, and neuropsychiatric disorders and unaffected controls shall also be sought. Other tissues including pre-mortem biopsies and surgical resections are also considered valuable resources for research and will be collected on an <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ad hoc</em> basis.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-indent: -.5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">2.<span style="font: 7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Acquire autopsy reports, medical records, and other clinical data from the next of kin of acquired donors. Using these information sources as well as other validated methods including a comprehensive neuropathological evaluation and post-mortem interviews (when appropriate), determine to a high-level of confidence, the clinical brain diagnoses of the donor at the time of death.</span></p>

The Contractor shall report data and an accurate index of their brain and tissue inventory to the NIH NeuroBioBank Portal, a third-party interactive website (Section 508 compliant), on a quarterly basis.</span></p>

Sufficient freezer space as well as additional storage and processing capacity for non-frozen material including fixed tissues will be considered when evaluating capacity to perform these services. The Contractor should provide a climate-controlled facility with the capacity to maintain room temperatures such that freezers can function normally when all equipment is operating, with sufficient back-up power to maintain normal operation in a power failure. The Contractor shall also provide enough back-up freezer space to accommodate the failure of at least one freezer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Complete transfer of the contents of a freezer shall occur within 2 hours of an initial freezer failure. Adequate on-site back-up power to handle complete electrical power failure must be provided.</span></p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plans to solicit proposals from Offerors that can demonstrate the capability to act as a data, statistics, and clinical trial support center; providing data and clinical research support and resources in managing and carrying out multiple trials in drug abuse research. NIDA is seeking systems for data management, statistical support, document management and clinical trial services. The systems will be used to support clinical data capture, data analysis, information exchange, scientific discovery efforts and clinical evaluation of promising new drug abuse treatment interventions in order to further NIDA's mission.<br /><br />NIDA's National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) conducts single and multi-site clinical trials through grants, contracts and cooperative agreements in sites located across the nation and in other countries. These are usually studies of behavioral, pharmacological, and integrated behavioral and pharmacological treatment interventions in rigorous, clinical trials to determine efficacy, effectiveness, practicality, and feasibility across a broad range of treatment settings and diversified patient populations and to transfer research results to physicians, clinicians, providers, and patients. In support of efforts to address the national opioid public health crisis, the CTN plans a significant expansion of its opioid research portfolio. Development and implementation of studies to improve access to high-quality addiction treatment, for example, by facilitating delivery of opioid use disorder treatment in general medical settings is expected. These studies could be Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, and/or Phase IV type trials. They may also include registry type trials or surveys.<br /><br />Although no actual clinical trials will be conducted under this requirement, the project activities will support NIDA trials in the following technical areas:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Establish and administer state-of-the-art, secured web-based systems for the collection, storage, management, quality assurance, and reporting of study data as well as systems to facilitate the collection and management of participant and site level electronic health records data.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Assist in the design and analysis of clinical trials, including the development of the statistical sections of protocols, study design, randomization and stratification methods, power and sample size calculations, interim monitoring and analysis plans, and data analytic plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Review and monitor the quality of study data including the development and management of a computerized data monitoring system that executes quality assurance and quality control procedures to evaluate accuracy, timeliness and completeness of data submitted by the clinical sites, including verification of the clinical and laboratory data used to determine that study participants have reached protocol-defined endpoints.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Monitor trial performance and progress and maintain a secure web-based clinical trial performance monitoring system to track key trial performance metrics (e.g. key dates, recruitment, availability of primary outcomes, missing data, etc.). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Coordinate meetings of study Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMB) to include the preparation and presentation of reports on safety, data integrity, and site performance as well as coordination of meeting sites, materials, travel support, etc.).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Participate in relevant committee and subcommittee meetings including representation by the contract Principal Investigator on the CTN Steering Committee and representation by other senior data and statistical experts on other relevant CTN committees, subcommittees and workgroups.<br /><br />NIDA anticipates that one (1) indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), task order contract will be awarded for a period of performance of three (3) years. NIDA may award either cost reimbursement and/or fixed price task orders under this contract. These individual task orders may include options and/or options quantities. If options or option quantities are utilized for an individual task order, it&nbsp;will be clearly defined in the Task Order RFP and be determined and evaluated at the time of task order solicitation and award. NIDA anticipates that at least one task order will be awarded with the contract. Future funding will be made through issuances of task orders and will be dependent on NIDA programmatic needs and availability of funds. Various task orders will be issued to support distinct tasks and studies which will separately support the CTN and the NIH launched HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) Initiative.<br /><br />RFP No. 75N95019R00016 will be available electronically on or about January 26, 2019.&nbsp;The RFP can be accessed through the FBO.gov or through the NIDA website: (URL: https://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nida-requests-contract-proposals-rfps). All information required for the submission of a proposal will be contained in or accessible through the RFP package. Responses to the RFP will be due 45 days from the release date. NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. <br /><br />Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

 The total fee for the contract term shall not exceed $15,000,000.  The guaranteed minimum for the contract term (including option years) is $10,000.  Firm-fixed price task orders will be negotiated for this contract.  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  Estimated construction cost of project is between $300,000 and $30,000,000.  Estimated start date is July 2019.
This proposed contract is being solicited on a 100% set-aside for small business concerns basis.  The Small Business size standard classification is North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541330, Engineering Services.  The Government seeks the most highly qualified firm to perform the required services, based on the demonstrated competence and qualifications, in accordance with the selection criteria.

The market research study Sources Sought Announcements OPHA1FY190001 and OPHA1FY190002 conducted by NAVFAC Hawaii included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms.  As a result of the market research analysis, there was not the minimum number of qualified WOSB or SDVOSB firms to perform the type of work solicited, and a determination was made to set aside this procurement under the Small Business Program as a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAVFAC Hawaii small business office concurs with this decision.
The type of design and engineering services expected to be performed under this contract are for various Design-Bid-Build and Design-Build mechanical engineering projects with associated multi-discipline architect-engineering support services for new construction, alteration, repair, and installation of mechanical systems and associated facilities.
All contractors are advised that registration in System for Award Management (SAM) Database is required prior to award of a contract.

<ARCHDATE>02022019
<CONTACT>Rodriguez, Diane
<DESC>This is a sources sought notice for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All businesses, regardless of size, capable of providing these items are invited to respond to this announcement and submit a capability statement for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine a firm's previous experience performing similar work as well as their technical, administrative, management, and financial capability.  The capability statements will be reviewed and used to determine an appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy.  
Proposed Project:
The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region has a requirement for the construction of the Arizona Heritage Trail.  The Trail will be approximately 3.6 miles long and will run along the Arizona side of the Colorado River from the top of Davis Dam to the Arizona State Route 68/NV State Route 163 Bridge (Laughlin Bridge).  The design includes two trailheads, one Davis Dam Trailhead and the other Davis Camp Trailhead; one trail, Desert Trail 12 feet wide and; three spur trails 8 feet wide, Mohave Spur Trail, Davis Camp Spur Trail, and McCormick spur trail; and two day-use facilities, Fishing Nodes and the Kayak Launch.   An aerial view of the area is provided.
Below is a brief description of each feature:
Davis Dam Trailhead
This trailhead would be located near the east end of the Davis Dam between Davis Dam Road and Lake Mohave.  The trailhead will include a trail entry monument, wayfinding shelter/trail map, interpretive panels, bike racks, trash receptacles, 2-unit vault accessible restrooms, doggy bag poop bag dispenser, and solar power for the lights.  Portions of the trailhead will be replanted with native vegetation provided by the NPS or a source approved by Reclamation and the NPS.  Access to the Lake Mohave Spur Trail will be from this trailhead.  Facilities at the trailhead and along the main trail and spur trail will include solar lights along the trail, with 2-3 fishing nodes, and 1 or 2 kayak launch facilities.  Retaining walls will be required along portions of the trail.
Davis Camp Trailhead
This trailhead would be located east of the Davis Camp entrance road.  Amenities at the Davis Camp Trailhead would include an entry monument, wayfinding shelter/trail map, interpretive panels, bike racks, trash receptacles, doggy bag poop bag dispenser, flush restrooms, potable water, picnic shelters, bike repair station, mist cooling system, equipment storage area, and a maintenance entrance gate, and parking lot.  Portions of the trailhead would be replanted with native vegetation provided by the NPS or a source approved by Reclamation and the NPS.  A spur trail lined with lights would lead from this trailhead into Davis Camp and would be maintained by Mohave County.  The Trail down to Highway 163 will be lighted.
Vehicles would access this trailhead from McCormick Boulevard off State Route 68.  Pedestrians and bicycles may also reach the Davis Camp Trailhead from the Davis Dam Trailhead via the proposed trails and pedestrian bridges that span the large drainage wash.  
Desert Trail
The hardened service Hike and Bike Desert Trail (Desert Trail) would start at the security barrier on the east end of Davis Dam and terminate at the Laughlin/Bullhead City Highway 163 Bridge.  The trail shall be of a hardened surface 12-foot wide with 2-foot shoulders on both sides of the trail.  The Trail shall be fully accessible and will be a combination of placed concrete and Roller Compacted concrete surfaces.
The Desert Trail would start from the north side of Davis Dam and parallel Davis Dam Road 750 feet to the proposed Davis Dam Trailhead adjacent to the west side of the Lake Mohave Spur Trail. 
The Desert Trail would cross Davis Dam Road approximately 1,850 feet east of the Davis Dam Trailhead.  The road crossing would be equipped with a crosswalk with yellow flashing lights.  The trail would then parallel David Dam Road to the southeast on an existing dam construction-era road until it intersects and follows the centerline of the dam;s electrical switchyard access road.  A small accessible parking lot would be constructed at this location. The security area access road would be equipped with an entry monument and gate.  The entry monument would be large enough to attract motorists and would be designed to identify the entry as well as highlight this area as a place of significance and special character.  The design theme would reflect the area's natural history and setting.  This portion of trail from Davis Dam road shall be designed to handle Trailer trucks and service vehicles.
The Desert Trail would pass the entrance to the switchyard and continue south on an existing transmission line right-of-way (ROW).  At the top of hill a small spur trail would lead to a proposed scenic overlook that would provide open views to the Colorado River valley, Davis Camp, Davis Dam, and the skylines of Laughlin and Bullhead City.  A shade shelter, bench, and interpretive panels, and garbage can would be placed at the overlook.
From the scenic overlook, the Desert Trail would continue south along the top of the ridgeline within the transmission line ROW and then onto an old construction road until it crosses a wash southeast of Inscription Rock.  A series of modular bridges would span the large wash as the trail continues south to the Davis Camp Trailhead. 
From the Davis Camp Trailhead the Desert Trail would head west adjacent to the Davis Camp Entry Road and turn left (South) to cross the Davis Camp Entrance road with a cross walk and yellow flashing lights.  The Trail would continue through Davis Camp.
Within Davis Camp there will be 2 access nodes, one on the north end and one behind the Museum on the southern end of the camp.  The sites would allow users within the camp access to the Desert Trail.  The points will provide parking, wayfinding, potable water, cooling misters, shade shelter, bike rack, bench, and garbage can. 
The Trail would continue behind the museum and them up near the highway and go down and use the existing crosswalk to connect to the Highway 163 Bridge Walkway.  As part of the Highway 163 Bridge rehabilitation the plan is to move the walkway to the North side of the Highway 163 Bridge.
Mohave Spur Trail
The Lake Mohave Spur Trail is an approximately 1,050 foot loop that would follow the existing dam construction-era roadway to the shore of Lake Mohave west of the Katherine Landing Access Road.  This Trail shall be 8-foot wide with 2-foot shoulders on both sides, it is anticipated that portions of this trail will require a retaining wall.  The trail would provide access to 2 or 3 fishing nodes and a Kayak/Canoe launch site.
Davis Camp Spur Trail
The Davis Camp Spur Trail would be a hardened 8-foot wide with 2-foot shoulders on both sides running west and parallel to north side of the Davis Camp Access Road to the Mohave County-managed Davis Camp entrance until it reaches the stop sign adjacent to the wash.  The trail would leave space for an additional access entry road between the existing paved roadway and the trail.
McCormick Spur Trail
The McCormick Spur Trail would be a hardened 8-foot wide with 2-foot shoulders on both sides running east from the North Davis Camp Entry Node up to the South side of the main access road into Davis Camp on out to the Highway 68 intersection to connect with an existing cross walk at the stop light.  Just prior to the Highway intersection it crosses an open area that will need to be designed for heavy loads and protected with folding or removable bollards. 
Fishing Nodes
Two or three fishing access nodes similar to the Laughlin fishing access points would be constructed along the Lake Mohave shoreline off the Lake Mohave Spur Trail.  The style of fishing node being evaluated for use is a cantilevered dock similar to those constructed as part of the Laughlin Heritage Greenway Trail.  The cantilevered dock could be constructed on adjacent uplands and extend over the water, and shall be accessible.
The precise location of the fishing nodes will be determined during the final site design, pending U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) permitting, and any potential cultural and biological resource concerns in the project area.  Biological and cultural surveys have been completed for the Project (DSG 2016; SRI 2016).
Kayak Launch
An accessible low maintenance kayak launch would be constructed along the Lake Mohave shoreline.  The precise location and design of the launch will be determined during the final site design, pending Corps permitting, and any potential cultural and biological resource concerns in the project area.  The facility shall be an accessible low maintenance sustainable facility, and handle a lake draw down of 12-feet. 
The estimated magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000 and $7,000,000.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 611310, which has a corresponding Size standard $27.5 Million. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years.
Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.

Program Details: The course of study will introduce students to unmanned maritime systems, provide them a complete understanding of the physical environment in which these systems operate, and teach them how the environment influences unmanned operations and mission planning. The purpose of this certification is for students to learn foundational material in which they can build more detailed skills related to the mission planning and operation of specific UUVs (Unmanned Undersea Vehicles, including powered vehicles as well as gliders) and USVs (Unmanned Surface Vehicles).

<p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify; line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Background: The Agency intends to issue a solicitation and ultimately enter into indefinite delivery purchase order (&ldquo;IDPO&rdquo;) with a commercial firm(s) to supply fresh bread and bakery products to military customers in New Jersey. These include various fresh baked breads, minimum 16 ounces per loaf and various fresh baked rolls, minimum 6 per package. Freshness requirements will be as follows: 1. Bread, Cakes, Doughnuts, Muffins, Pies and Rolls must be delivered no more than 24 hours after baking. Following a non-bake day, these items must be delivered no more than 72 hours after baking. 2. Brown and Serve Rolls must be delivered within 36 hours after production. 3. Bakery products shall include mold inhibitors of the proper level as allowed by the Food and Drug Administration (&ldquo;FDA&rdquo;). 4.

After soliciting, the Agency intends to make one award.<span style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp; </span>Offerors are required to propose on all items in the Schedule of Items. Failure to do so may result in a proposal being deemed technically unacceptable and therefore excluded from further consideration for award.<span style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp; </span>Because the Contracting Officer is not obligated to initiate negotiations, when proposing to the solicitation each offeror shall submit its most competitive proposal.<span style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp; </span>Said proposal shall be responsive to all of the Solicitation&rsquo;s requirements and free from any deficiencies. </span></p>

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Philadelphia is seeking eligible contractors to furnish effort including labor, material, and facilities as may be required to repair and/or modify the item specified within this document.
The Government intends to solicit with approved sources only under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for Repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) in support of 2-line item components, which are uploaded as an Attachment “A” for multiple aircrafts platforms: Items will be repaired by Parker Hannifin (59211) located in Irvine, CA. The repair work is performed by Parker’s own facilities located in various cities to include performance taking place in Irvine, CA; Kalamazoo, MI; Elyria, OH; Dublin, GA; Hauppauge, NY.
Parker is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of these items and is the only known source to possess full repair capability.
The Government does not possess (or cannot provide) the data necessary to perform the required repairs or manufacture of the item. Therefore, the items listed on the Attachment “A” are sole source to Parker. 
Even though these items are sole source to Parker, all responsible sources may identify their interest and provide capability statements in response to this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this sources sought notice will be considered by the Government.
A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Source Approval is required as these items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition. NAVSUP WSS will not delay award while Source Approval is pending.
The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source, you must submit together with your proposal the information detailed in the NAVSUP-WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.
Additional information for submitting a Source Approval Request package can be obtained at: https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navsupwss/business_opp.

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be process in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet the Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<RESPDATE>013019
<CONTACT>Quintin Hackshaw, Contracting Officer, Phone 2022600453, Email quintin.hackshaw@hhs.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Small Business Sources Sought Notice<br />ASPR/BARDA Contract Research Organizations for Clinical Studies<br />Special Notice No.: 19-BARDA-CSN-SBSSN-001</strong></p>
<p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSSN) is to seek declarations of technical capabilities, data, and materials from qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)]. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) intends to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to all types and categories of small businesses. The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this proposed requirement is 541711.</p>
<p>Please note that (Special Notice # 19-BARDA-CSN-OTSBSSN-001) Other Than Small Business Sources Sought Notice (OTSBSSN) will also be posted regarding this possible requirement, and is intended solely for prospective Offerors that are considered to be Other Than Small Business. Prospective Offerors should respond to the appropriate Sources Sought Notice relative to their business size standard.</p>
<p>Your response to the information requested will assist the United States Government (USG) in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether a small business set-aside is a possibility.</p>
<p>This SBSSN is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not constitute a commitment by the USG. The USG is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 10, to identify potential small business sources to fulfill the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market. All information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice is voluntary and the USG will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the USG. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately. All submitted information shall remain with the USG and will not be returned.</p>
<p><strong>II. AUTHORITY</strong></p>
<p>The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Division of Contracts &amp; Management issues this SBSSN on behalf of BARDA pursuant to FAR paragraphs 5.205(c) and FAR parts 10 and 19.</p>
<p><strong>III. PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>This Notice seeks declarations of technical capabilities, data and materials from the public on current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP)-compliant clinical research organizations (CROs) and similar entities that are capable of managing some or all of the services required to conduct clinical trials of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats, influenza and emerging infectious diseases. BARDA, within the ASPR at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), intends to use responses to this Notice for planning potential future acquisitions. This is not a request for proposals; BARDA will not award any contracts under this Notice. The objective of this SBSSN is to collect information about declared availabilities, capabilities, and other pertinent marketplace data about entities providing clinical trial support in order to strengthen BARDA's understanding of the current and future marketplace. BARDA will avail small businesses the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in BARDA acquisitions as either prime contractors (provided their technical proposal and business plan are in the competitive range), or as subcontractors to the prime.</p>
<p>Potential future solicitations may include services, not necessarily full service, to conduct Phase I, II, III, and IV clinical trials or to provide specific services to support the development of MCMs for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats, influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. The goal of ASPR/BARDA is to enhance the ability of HHS to obtain quality products and services economically, efficiently, and lawfully.</p>
<p><strong>IV. BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>BARDA, within the Office of the ASPR at HHS, intends to use responses to this SBSSN for planning purposes towards the possible procurement of services from CROs and similar entities. In an effort to improve preparedness, the USG is seeking to re-define the current Clinical Studies Network (CSN) service capabilities to continue to support advanced clinical development of MCMs. BARDA is planning a new solicitation to further refine standing core functions and fill gaps in services of the existing CSN. BARDA established the CSN as a core service in 2012 and awarded Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts to five full service CROs in 2013 to form the CSN infrastructure. During the five years of the CSN's existence, several important gaps in capabilities were identified and will be addressed in the new solicitation.</p>
<p>Additional needs of the CSN include:</p>
<p>1) Long-term storage capacity for records, investigational products (IP), and biological specimens;<br />2) A statistical services and data coordination center;<br />3) The ability to engage services on a routine basis without urgent timelines, and<br />4) The ability to engage services during a public health emergency (PHE) when rapid timelines are crucial.</p>
<p><strong>V. CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT</strong></p>
<p>Capability statements submitted by potential sources in response to this announcement should demonstrate the respondent's qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to meet these requirements, with particular attention to the technical areas specified below. Past performance is considered essential. In preparing tailored Capability Statements, interested parties are asked to identify relevant experience.</p>
<p><strong>V.I CLINICAL TRIAL PLANNING AND EXECUTION</strong></p>
<p>BARDA seeks a diverse pool of CROs or similar entities to provide clinical trial planning and execution services as primary contactors. Service capabilities include project management, study start up, site training and support, site feasibility and selection, site monitoring and management, specimen and IP management, laboratory services, regulatory services, Institutional Review Board services, quality assurance, as well as other services. During public health emergencies (PHEs), services need to be rapid, adaptable, scientifically robust, and minimally disruptive to the course of patient care. Considerations for executing such services need to include:</p>
<p>1) Phase of the study in relation to the development stage of the MCM investigational product (Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, or Phase IV)<br />2) The type of study (e.g., interventional or observational studies)<br />3) The requirement for near real-time data availability<br />4) The scale of the PHE (e.g., national versus local versus international)<br />5) The class of MCM (e.g., drug, biologic, device, or combination product).</p>
<p>BARDA acknowledges that some Respondents may have strengths in providing these services in the conduct of routine (i.e., preparedness) studies, while others may have strengths operating in response (i.e., emergency) scenarios. Therefore, BARDA intends to evaluate Respondents separately for these two capabilities. Respondents may respond to one or to both capability(ies) (i.e., VI.I.I and/or VI.I.II).</p>
<p><strong>V.I.I ROUTINE CLINICAL SERVICES&#63719;MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>&bull; A quality-focused CRO or similar organization that has conducted infectious disease or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threat clinical studies under a FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the last 5 years.<br />&bull; Able to manage or subcontract all clinical trial planning and execution services specified above for Phase I - IV domestic and international clinical trials.<br />&bull; Compliant procedures aligned with all applicable International Council for Harmonization (ICH)-Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and U.S. Food and Drug Administration or global health regulatory authority regulations.<br />&bull; Ability to author IND documents and provide Regulatory Operations publishing and submission capabilities.<br />&bull; Must communicate and facilitate near real-time information sharing between all entities comprising the CSN, including the Statistical Services and Data Coordinating Center and the specimen and IP archiving facility.</p>
<p><strong>V.I.II RESPONSE CLINICAL STUDIES&#63719;MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>In addition to meeting all of the above, the Respondent must have:</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to respond to RFPs for task orders under very short timelines.<br />&bull; Ability to set up and conduct quality-focused clinical studies under very short timelines in order to meet a response scenario.<br />&bull; Internal systems and processes in place to support and protect worker safety and security in austere settings.</p>

<DESC><p><strong><br />Other Than Small Business Sources Sought Notice<br />ASPR/BARDA Contract Research Organizations for Clinical Studies<br />Special Notice No.: 19-BARDA-CSN-OTSBSSN-001<br /></strong><br /><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong><br /><br />The purpose of this Other Than Small Business Sources Sought Notice (OTSBSSN) is to seek declarations of technical capabilities, data, and materials from qualified other than small business concerns. The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this proposed requirement is 541711.<br /><br />Please note that (Special Notice # 19-BARDA-CSN-SBSSN-001) Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSSN) has also been posted regarding this possible requirement, and is intended solely for prospective Offeror's that are considered to be a Small Business. Prospective Offeror's should respond to the appropriate SSN relative to their business size standard.<br /><br />If the prospective Offeror is unable to meet all of the requirements listed below, BARDA encourages the Offeror to provide as much information as possible for those items applicable.<br /><br />This OTSBSSN is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not constitute a commitment by the USG. The USG is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 10, to identify potential other than small business sources to fulfill the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market. All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the USG will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the USG. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately. All submitted information shall remain with the USG and will not be returned.</p>
<p><strong>II. AUTHORITY</strong></p>
<p>The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Division of Contracts &amp; Management issues this SBSSN on behalf of BARDA pursuant to FAR paragraphs 5.205(c) and FAR parts 10 and 19.</p>
<p><strong>III. PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>This Notice seeks declarations of technical capabilities, data and materials from the public on current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP)-compliant clinical research organizations (CROs) and similar entities that are capable of managing some or all of the services required to conduct clinical trials of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats, influenza and emerging infectious diseases. BARDA, within the ASPR at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), intends to use responses to this Notice for planning potential future acquisitions. This is not a request for proposals; BARDA will not award any contracts under this Notice. The objective of this SBSSN is to collect information about declared availabilities, capabilities, and other pertinent marketplace data about entities providing clinical trial support in order to strengthen BARDA's understanding of the current and future marketplace. BARDA will avail small businesses the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in BARDA acquisitions as either prime contractors (provided their technical proposal and business plan are in the competitive range), or as subcontractors to the prime.</p>
<p>Potential future solicitations may include services, not necessarily full service, to conduct Phase I, II, III, and IV clinical trials or to provide specific services to support the development of MCMs for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats, influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. The goal of ASPR/BARDA is to enhance the ability of HHS to obtain quality products and services economically, efficiently, and lawfully.</p>
<p><strong>IV. BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>BARDA, within the Office of the ASPR at HHS, intends to use responses to this SBSSN for planning purposes towards the possible procurement of services from CROs and similar entities. In an effort to improve preparedness, the USG is seeking to re-define the current Clinical Studies Network (CSN) service capabilities to continue to support advanced clinical development of MCMs. BARDA is planning a new solicitation to further refine standing core functions and fill gaps in services of the existing CSN. BARDA established the CSN as a core service in 2012 and awarded Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts to five full service CROs in 2013 to form the CSN infrastructure. During the five years of the CSN's existence, several important gaps in capabilities were identified and will be addressed in the new solicitation.</p>
<p>Additional needs of the CSN include:</p>
<p>1) Long-term storage capacity for records, investigational products (IP), and biological specimens;<br />2) A statistical services and data coordination center;<br />3) The ability to engage services on a routine basis without urgent timelines, and<br />4) The ability to engage services during a public health emergency (PHE) when rapid timelines are crucial.</p>
<p><strong>V. CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT</strong></p>
<p>Capability statements submitted by potential sources in response to this announcement should demonstrate the respondent's qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to meet these requirements, with particular attention to the technical areas specified below. Past performance is considered essential. In preparing tailored Capability Statements, interested parties are asked to identify relevant experience.</p>
<p><strong>V.I CLINICAL TRIAL PLANNING AND EXECUTION</strong></p>
<p>BARDA seeks a diverse pool of CROs or similar entities to provide clinical trial planning and execution services as primary contactors. Service capabilities include project management, study start up, site training and support, site feasibility and selection, site monitoring and management, specimen and IP management, laboratory services, regulatory services, Institutional Review Board services, quality assurance, as well as other services. During public health emergencies (PHEs), services need to be rapid, adaptable, scientifically robust, and minimally disruptive to the course of patient care. Considerations for executing such services need to include:</p>
<p>1) Phase of the study in relation to the development stage of the MCM investigational product (Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, or Phase IV)<br />2) The type of study (e.g., interventional or observational studies)<br />3) The requirement for near real-time data availability<br />4) The scale of the PHE (e.g., national versus local versus international)<br />5) The class of MCM (e.g., drug, biologic, device, or combination product).</p>
<p>BARDA acknowledges that some Respondents may have strengths in providing these services in the conduct of routine (i.e., preparedness) studies, while others may have strengths operating in response (i.e., emergency) scenarios. Therefore, BARDA intends to evaluate Respondents separately for these two capabilities. Respondents may respond to one or to both capability(ies) (i.e., VI.I.I and/or VI.I.II).</p>

Special Notice
Request for Information Only

The Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO20 is looking for sources of the following.

STATEMENT OF WORK/SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS

Department of Veterans Affairs
Seattle VA Medical Center
Overview: Portland VAMC requires Prospective contractors to provide the following Cianna Medical SAVI SCOUT.  Brand Name or Equal per FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal to Cianna Medical.

1 EA SSCSYS-01 - SCOUT Console 2.5D and Guide

Objective: Our objective is to provide Portland VAMC with necessary equipment to provide the best care for our veterans.   OHSU (Oregon health and Science University) no longer provides needle localization for sentinel lymph node biopsy. Which the VA relied upon and currently has equipment to support. OHSU has since upgraded to the Savi scout system which employs a microchip into the breast tissue. 
The SCOUT System employs micro-impulse radar and infrared light (IR) technology to determine the relative proximity of the Reflector, which is placed into the breast during a prior procedure. The Console provides the micro-impulse radar signal to the Handpiece along with power for the infrared light sources. The Handpiece delivers the micro-impulse radar signal and infrared light into the breast tissue and in turn receives signals reflected back from the Reflector. The Console processes the reflected radar signals to provide the surgeon with Reflector proximity information via audible and visual feedback. Basically this will be our new system for breast tumor localization

Salient Characteristics 

The Government requires the following characteristics to be met:

Must be compatible with SAVI Scout System
Small non-radioactive, non-magnetic device that allows for real time distance  measurement with a 60mm detection range, 360 degree detection within 1 mm of accuracy in pinpointing the location of tumor.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for information only. Replies by interested parties will be used by this agency for preliminary planning purposes. No proposal or contract will be awarded from this notice. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests.<br /><br />The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers has been tasked to solicit and award a firm-fixed price contract for Construction of a Multi-purpose Training Complex (MPTC), at Fort Irwin, CA. <br /><br />The National Training Center (NTC) is considered the premier training facility for the Army. Each month a new Rotational Training Unit (RTU) rolls into Fort Irwin to acquire their Brigade Combat Team (BCT) training through tough, realistic land operations with their unified action partners to prepare the BCTs and other units for combat while taking care of soldiers, their families, and civilians.
<p>Fort Irwin currently has a Multipurpose Training Range (MPTR) which is setup by hand as necessary to train units. There is currently no reliable capability to train crews to maneuver and engage moving targets. This project is required to train and test crews and dismounted infantry squads on the skills necessary to detect, identify, engage, and defeat stationary infantry and stationary/moving armor targets in a tactical array. It will provide both armor and infantry crews the opportunity to maneuver and engage moving targets.</p>
<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>The MPRC satisfies the individual and collective training and qualification requirements for armor, infantry, and aviation crews/platoons. This complex supports dismounted infantry tactical live fire operations independently and with supporting vehicles. This range supports individual and collective training and qualification for platoons, sections, teams, and crews on the skills necessary to detect, identify, engage, and defeat stationary and moving armor and infantry targets in a tactical array. With all fully automated targets, the event-specific target scenarios are computer driven and scored from the range control tower. Captured audio/video are then compiled and available to the unit during the AAR.</p>
<p>Construct a standard Multi-Purpose Range Complex (MPRC). Primary facilities include a 3-lane (6 course roads) with midpoint crossover capability MPRC, concrete bore sighting area for all machine gun and main gun with access to and from the main firing line, bore site panels, range operations control area, control tower, after action review building (large), operations/storage building (large), bleacher enclosure, covered mess, latrine (aerated vault type), ammunition loading dock, unit staging area, and bivouac area. Targetry layout for the MPRC will ensure capability to meet MPMG Heavy (0.50 cal) qualificaiton requirements.</p>
<p>Supporting facilities include electric service, site improvements, and information systems. The existing site is limited in facility and component re-use other than utilizing the existing target berms as potential borrow sites. Measures in accordance with the Department of Defense (DoD) Minimum Antiterrorism for Buildings standards will be provided. Facilities will be designed to a minimum life of 50 years in accordance with DoD's Unified Facilities Code (UFC 1-200-02) including energy efficiencies, building envelope and integrated building systems performance. Sustainability/Energy measures will be provided. Air Conditioning (Estimated 9 Tons).</p>

<p>Summary of Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The JFF Bypass Pipe at Lower Monumental has approximately 200' of 32" HDPE pipe that is above ground and exposed to seasonal temperature variation resulting in large displacement of the pipe at the expansion joint at the top of the pipe. Over time the pipe has gotten shorter, causing the expansion joint to be separated from the pipe during extreme cold temperature.<br /><br />The work includes the following:<br /><br />&bull; Cut the 32" HDPE pipe in two places, and reposition the middle and upper sections of the pipe to align with the connecting pipes in the middle section and the flume transition at the top of the upper section. The 32" HDPE pipe is elevated 10-20 feet above grade at the locations where the expansion joints are to be installed.<br /><br />&bull; Fabricate and install two new custom expansion joints for the 32" pipe and one for the 24" pipe that connects to the 32" pipe to allow for the thermal expansion and contraction of the HDPE pipe. The expansion joints, designed by the government, will consist of an insert piece that will slide inside the HDPE pipe on the downstream end of the expansion joint, a spacer spool of pipe that is tapered to transition from the inside diameter of the HDPE pipe to the inside of inside diameter of the insert piece, two mounting flanges with set screws to attach to the ends of the HDPE pipe, and a packing type seal between the sleeve piece and the downstream end of the HDPE pipe. The expansion joint components will be fabricated from 304L stainless steel. The expansion joints are designed to provide a smooth flow of water for transportation of juvenile and adult fish.<br />&nbsp;<br />In-water work is December 15, 2019 - March 31, 2020.<br /><br />All on-site work shall be performed in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1).</p>
<p>The Contractor will be responsible for establishing and managing an effective on-site Safety and Health program in accordance with EM 385-1-1 that will require the development and submission of a comprehensive project specific Accident Prevention Plan for Government acceptance. In addition, the Contractor will be required to develop and submit for Government acceptance Activity Hazard Analyses for each phase of work and a project specific Fall Protection Plan that comply with EM 385-1-1.</p>
<p>A Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) employed by the prime contractor shall be required for each shift of the contractor's on-site operations. The SSHO shall possess a minimum of 5-years' experience in construction safety on similar projects, shall have completed the 30-Hour OSHA Construction Safety training within the last 5-years, and shall have completed at least 24-hours of formal safety training each year for the past 5-years.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be responsible for establishing and managing an effective Contractor Quality Control (CQC) System that will require the development and submission of a comprehensive project specific CQC Plan for Government acceptance. A CQC System Manager employed by the prime contractor shall be required to be on-site for each shift of the Contractor's operations. The CQC System Manager must possess a minimum of 5-years relevant experience in a supervisory or management position such as Quality Control Manager, Quality Assurance Manager, or Construction Manager directly involved in the management of construction quality at the project site. In addition, the CQC System Manager shall have completed the course entitled "Construction Quality Management for Contractors" within the last 5-years. <br /><br />The Contractor will be required to use the Government-furnished Construction Contractor Module (referred to as QCS) of the Resident Management System (RMS) to record, maintain, and submit various information throughout the contract period. QCS is a Windows-based program that can be run on a stand-alone personal computer or on a network. The Government will make the QCS software available to the Contractor after contract award.</p>
<p>The project will involve the development and management of Contractor furnished submittals for items such as pre-construction plans, product data, test reports, and contract close-out documentation as required by the technical specifications of the contract.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous work within the project includes the delivery of As-Built Drawings.</p>

DESCRIPTION:  This is a Sources Sought-Pre-Solicitation Notice for the establishment of an Architect-Engineering (A-E) contract with services to be performed at the Albany VA Medical Center, 113 Holland Ave, Albany, NY 12208.  This requirement is 100% set-aside to Small Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms.   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330s. The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP, scroll down to locate and click on the SF-330 hyperlink entitled,  Architect-Engineer Qualifications.   

VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for complete design services (preliminary concepts and layouts, program development, investigative services, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services) for the Design   Replace Cooling Tower, Project# 528A8-19-807. 

The area of consideration is restricted to firms with offices and key personnel to be assigned to the design located within a 400-mile radius of the Albany VAMC site as indicated by a mapquest.com driving directions search from the prime designer s main or satellite office address to the project site.
.

Written questions pertaining to this requirement should be submitted no later than 4:00 PM. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), February 4, 2019.  Interested firms should submit their current SF-330, Parts I and II, to Nicholas.Winne@va.gov.  The SF-330s are due no later than 4:00 PM, EDT, February 13, 2019.  

SCOPE OF WORK: 
The project includes design and construction period services for replacing Cooling Towers #1 and #2 on the roof of the chilled water plant (Bldg #54).  The existing cooling towers date to 1988 (estimated) and are developing leaks in the basin.  The structural steel supporting the cooling towers also needs to be replaced.  The existing towers are each rated for a nominal 700 ton capacity and serve chillers #1 and #2 respectively.  These cooling towers also serve a plate and frame heat exchanger which is used for a water side economizer system when outdoor air temperatures are suitable.

The A/E will develop the following add alternates in addition to replacing the cooling towers: 
 
Alternate #1 will provide piping and associated automatic valving and/or other controls to cross connect the cooling tower basins and cooling tower supply of Cooling Towers #1 & #2 with Cooling Tower #3 to provide improved redundancy and flexible plant operations.  Cooling Tower #3 is rated for a nominal 1000 tons capacity.  Under this alternate it is desired that any given cooling tower can serve any given chiller.  The existing condenser water pumps will remain in service.  

Alternate #2 will provide for a supplemental condenser water treatment such as UV lights to work in conjunction with traditional chemical treatment to reduce scaling and/or bacterial growth and aid in the prevention of legionella.

Alternate #3 will provide for installation of VFDs on condenser water pumps #15 and #16 serving Chiller #3

The AE shall conduct an engineering survey of the project to:
Evaluate the existing cooling tower dunnage and structural steel support.
Determine winter operation requirements for the water side economizer system.
Evaluate the existing electrical service, pipe sizes, pump capacity, and chiller flow requirements
Confirm existing condenser water piping configuration and size.  Provide analysis on the soundness of the existing condenser water piping for all three towers (including CT #3).  Recommend replacing piping if expected service life is less than the expected life of the towers.  
Develop  as-built  documentation of existing cooling towers as needed for design.  The VA has no information on the existing cooling tower installation or cad base sheets for the chiller plant.
Identify service space and rigging requirements.
Identify methods of protecting the roof while the work is progressing.
Identify any modifications needed to provide an automated condenser water circulation sequence to comply with health department guidelines with minimum energy usage
Survey and identify any required architectural or structural modifications.
Identify any dead legs that may be a deterrent to use of water circulation for bacterial control.  
A report on the engineering survey results shall be submitted for approval in advance of the 35% design submission
The A/E shall perform all work necessary to prepare the specifications, drawings, bidding documents, and provide construction period services for the subject project.  The design shall follow all VA/VHA Standards, VA Design Manuals, VHA Directives, Federal Energy Management Programs, as well as local, state, and federal codes. The A/E shall perform all work necessary to prepare the specifications, drawings, bidding documents, and provide construction period services for the subject project.

Throughout the design phase and construction phase, the A/E shall produce and maintain all meeting minutes. Meeting Minutes shall be submitted to the VA for concurrence within three (3) working days after a meeting. The A/E shall provide written response to design comments from the previous phases of design prior to submission of the succeeding phase submission within 7 working days of receipt of the Comments from the VA. Incomplete responses are grounds for rejection. Failure to incorporate all documented VA comments into succeeding phase submissions are grounds for rejection.  Invoices for work performed cannot be submitted until verification of design comments have been demonstrated to be incorporated into design documents and accepted by the COR.  
  
Prior to the submission of the un-reviewed final drawings and specifications, the A/E shall conduct a narrative walk-through with the COR for each of the trades included in the project to demonstrate that the work shown on the drawings can be physically constructed as depicted. The trades shall include, but not be limited to architectural, structural, plumbing, HVAC, fire protection and electrical. The designer for each trade shall be present at the walk-through which will encompass all of the physical areas affected by the project. Individual walk-through may be conducted for specific trades. Upon completion of the walk-through, the VA will give direction to the A/E whether the design may proceed to completion as shown or whether some redesign is necessary. The walk-through shall be scheduled by the A/E in a manner that will allow corrections before the un-reviewed final submission due date. Required corrections will not excuse the A/E from submitting the un-reviewed final drawings and specifications on time.

All designs will follow, but not be limited to, the VA HVAC Design Manual, Steam & Heating Hot Water Design Manual and Sustainable Design Manuals in conjunction with the VA Master specifications. The design will be completed in a manner such that the estimated construction cost is within the VA budget. 



OFFERORS WILL BE EVALUATED ON THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
The submitted SF-330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:
This acquisition will be in accordance with FAR Part 36.602-1 and VAAR Part 836.602-1. The following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate SF-330 technical proposals:

The A/E must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation criteria for all services. Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria (5) and (6) are of slightly less importance than (1) through (4), but are equal value among themselves; Criteria (7) and (8) are the least important and listed in descending order of importance. Specific evaluation criteria include:

1. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required,  including, 
where appropriate, experience in central plant design, water cooled chillers, energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.
 2.  Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.
 3.  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.
 4.  Past Performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.
5.  Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.
6.  Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
7.  Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.
 8.  Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete  architectural and engineering services.

Criterion 1 - Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials. Offerors will be evaluated on specialized experience and technical competence in the performance of services similar to those anticipated under this contract with regard to:

Criterion 3 - Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Firms/teams will be evaluated in terms of their ability to plan for and manage work under the contract and capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.

Submission requirements: Describe the firm s ability to concurrently perform and manage multiple projects in different locations to meet aggressive schedules, multiple disciplines, and control costs and the firm s capacity to accomplish multiple projects simultaneously. 

Criterion 4 - Past Performance   Offerors will be evaluated on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.  Evaluating past performance and experience will include information provided in Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) or CPARS/ACASS for Criterion 1 projects and may include other information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criteria. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being rated lower. NOTE: Past performance information for projects listed under Criterion 1.

Submission requirements: SUBMIT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION FOR EACH PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1. IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in this notice is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion 1.  AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS IS AVAILABLE. IF A CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF-330. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, offerors should complete and submit with their responses the first page of the PPQ (Attachment), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s). Offerors may submit a PPQ previously submitted under a different Notice/RFP (legible copies are acceptable) as long as it is on the same form as posted with this Synopsis.  Offerors should follow up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If requested by the client, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Network Contracting Office 2 Attn: Nicholas Winne via email at Nicholas.Winne@va.gov prior to the response date.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their response PPQs or CPARS previously submitted in response to other A/E services procurements.

Evaluation Scoring

Evaluation factors 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will be evaluated using the following adjectival ratings as follows:

Outstanding: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low. 
Good: Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low. 
Acceptable: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate.  
Marginal: Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high. 
Unacceptable: Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is not awardable. The firm s proposal demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement and the approach fails to meet performance standards. The firm s proposal has major omissions and inadequate details to assure evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of requirement.

The ratings identified below were used in the evaluation of Past Performance (Criterion 4):

Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they can satisfy the requirements of the contract.

Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Little doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they could satisfy the requirements of the contract.
Unknown Confidence (Neutral): No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.
Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Some doubt exists based on past performance that they could satisfy the terms and conditions of the contract.
No Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectations that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Significant doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they can satisfy the requirements of the contract.
SELECTION INTERVIEW:
Interviews shall be scheduled with firms slated as the most highly qualified. Firms slated for interviews may be asked to explain or expand on information contained in the SF-330 submittal through a formal interview or a discussion questionnaire as determined by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Integrated Mission Equipment for Vertical Lift Systems (IME) project is tackling challenges with current architectural approaches and integration methods that cannot sustain the rapid growth of system complexity nor the rate of change required to keep Army aviation systems ahead of emerging threats. IME supports capability advancement for Future Vertical Lift through the transition of multiple knowledge products and demonstration materials. The government's overarching goal is to acquire and field systems that meet its business goals and technical requirements in a timely, cost-effective manner. Architecture is a carrier of key decisions regarding business and technical goals and architecture verification will provide the government with early and ongoing insight into the ability of an implemented system to meet these goals and requirements. IME will establish an Architecture Verification Environment (AVE) to analyze architectures and designs against their requirements and verify that implementations satisfy those requirements.
<p>The attached RFI requests feedback from industry on the general AVE approach, as well as responses to questions about current technologies, practices, and methods. Responses will help inform and shape the use cases and requirements for the AVE.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Acquisitions Operations Branch (AOB) seeks to award a sole source award to the CiM Maintenance Inc., 6300 Auteuil, Suite 201 Brossard, Quebec, Canada, J4Z3P2, for a CiM Visual Planner Suite for MAXIMO, Maintenance Service Plan (MSP) renewal.  The CiM Visual Planner Suite is a proprietary software add-on for MAXIMO, and since it is built into MAXIMO, it utilizes MAXIMO¿s existing security access and workflows.  The four modules in the Visual Planner Suite are clones of existing MAXIMO modules so new users do not have to learn how to work within the modules since they have the same functionality they are used to, including result set queries and database configuration.  All other resource planning/scheduling software resembles Microsoft Project in functionality, which is not visual or intuitive and would require extensive formal training to get users capable of being proficient in the use of the software. With the Visual Planner Suite, these functions are intuitive and include ¿Drag and Drop¿ to schedule any activity or group of activities in a calendar view, click on any icon to perform actions, mouse over feature to display object attributes instantly, and hyperlink directly to any MAXIMO related application.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 511210 and the size standard is $38.5 million in revenue. 
The Government intends to solicit directly with CiM Maintenance, Inc.  No solicitation package will be issued.   This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, if any interested party believes that they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities must be submitted in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Ability to engage ALL listed capabilities within the attached Sole Source Justification is required to be considered capable.  A determination to compete this action based on the responses received is in the sole discretion of the Government.  All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities in writing via email to bworkman@usbr.gov.  If no responsive statements are received by 01/16/2018 at 12:00 PM MT, an award will be made to CiM Maintenance, Inc.

<CONTACT>
<DESC>.The Nuclear Energy Oak Ridge Site Office (NE-ORSO) of the Department of Energy (DOE) plans to contract with American Centrifuge Operating LLC (ACO), a subsidiary of Centrus Energy Corp., for the demonstration of high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) production to support DOE research and development activities and programs.  The HALEU Demonstration Program has two primary objectives: (1) Deployment of a 16 machine AC-100M HALEU Cascade producing a 19.75% U235 enriched product by October 2020; and (2) Demonstration of the capability to produce HALEU with existing U.S.-origin enrichment technology, and provide DOE with a small quantity of HALEU beginning in 2020 for use in its research and development for the advancement of civilian nuclear energy and security, and other programmatic missions. The period of performance for this award is anticipated to be January 2019 ? December 2020 with a one year option. 
ACO is the only source capable of executing the contract activities to meet the requirements of the HALEU Demonstration Program. DOE?s objective is to demonstrate the capability to produce HALEU by October 2020 utilizing U.S.-origin uranium enrichment technology.  The use of existing U.S.-origin enrichment technology is needed in order to meet this schedule.  Demonstrating the capability of U.S.-origin enrichment technology for the production of HALEU is the objective because only U.S.-origin technology would be capable of producing HALEU for use in any type of advanced reactor application, civilian or defense-related. The AC- 100M enrichment technology is the only existing U.S.- origin uranium enrichment technology, and, further, it has the potential to be deployed at a commercial-scale serving the broadest market need.  In addition, due to the sensitive nature regarding access to and operation of U.S.-origin enrichment technology, the Department requires the contractor to be a U.S.-owned and U.S.- controlled entity.  ACO, as well as Centrus Energy Corp., are U.S.-owned and U.S.-controlled entities. Further, ACO is the only U.S.-owned and -controlled entity with an existing NRC license that would enable it to meet DOE?s schedule for the demonstration, and ACO is currently subleasing DOE?s facility in Piketon, Ohio designed for uranium enrichment operations.  ACO is in this unique position because it developed the AC- 100M centrifuge and associated equipment; it possesses proprietary data associated with advanced designs related to that technology; and it has demonstrated technical expertise in operating the AC- 100M equipment and technology. In sum, ACO is the only U.S.-owned and -controlled entity capable at this time to demonstrate and operate the only existing U.S.- origin uranium enrichment technology on the required schedule. Therefore, DOE intends to award a sole source contract to ACO. 
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.
This is a NOTICE OF INTENT; no solicitation is available for this requirement. If a firm believes that it has the capability to perform this work within the schedule described above, then it may submit a capability statement NO LATER THAN January 22, 2019, by 3:00 p.m. (Eastern) via e-mail to Karen.Shears@orem.doe.gov. The written response must include demonstration of the firm?s capability to perform the services indicated in this announcement, including demonstration of capability to obtain access to AC-100M enrichment technology in accordance with 10 CFR Part 725, evidence of  the firm?s ownership and control, and past performance information for similar work.
A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 
Questions and Answers: 
Question:	Regarding the following sentence: Demonstrating the capability of U.S.-origin enrichment technology for the production of HALEU is the objective because only U.S.-origin technology would be capable of producing HALEU for use in any type of advanced reactor application, civilian or defense-related. Is it DOE's position that U.S.-origin technology is required to produce HALEU for civilian advanced reactor applications?
Answer:	No, it is not DOE's position that U.S.-origin technology is required to produce HALEU for civilian advanced reactor applications. However, HALEU produced using U.S-origin technology can be used in both civilian and defense-related advanced reactor applications.  Accordingly, as stated, the objective of this procurement is to demonstrate the capability of U.S.- origin enrichment technology for the production of HALEU because such HALEU could be used in any type of advanced reactors, including defense reactors that require the use of HALEU produced using U.S.- origin technology.  
The addition of the question and answer is the only change to the Notice of Intent dated 01/07/2019.  There is no modification to the response deadline of 01/22/2019.

Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), the &ldquo;services may be deemed available only from the original source in case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in &ndash; (A) substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency&rsquo;s requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The SONIC Strike requirement is to provide the NSG User Community with sustained support of, and access to, NCL GEOINT data, products, and capabilities until the NSG can be completely transitioned off of NCL to a cloud-based solution.

In addition to providing 24x7 Tier-2/3 system support, the requirement includes support of the existing NCL baseline, which consists of more than 2.5M Source Lines of Code (SLOC). The NCL software resides both in East and West data centers, integrates with the NSG architecture, interfaces with internal and external clients, and manages an extensive 40 Petabytes (PB) of NSG data holdings. BAE has in place the infrastructure, baseline, capabilities, and established interfaces necessary to complete the required tasks. The period of performance for this requirements is one base year and two one year options.</p>

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Vista Partners LLC, 5645 Saddle Creek Trail, Parker, CO 80134, as the only responsible source that can provide an Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric 4 (ANAM4) software. This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.5 Test Procedures for Commercial Items. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24 are incorporated. <br />The Office of The Surgeon General (OTSG) has a need for the Automated Neurological Assessment Metrics 4 (ANAM4) software, associated licenses. <br />As a deployed application, ANAM4 is used to perform baseline NCAT testing on deploying personnel, as well as NCAT assessment following a diagnosed concussion or mild TBI (mTBI). Post-injury NCAT assessments can be compared to Service Member baseline NCAT assessments, to inform return-to-duty decisions by medical providers. The current NCAT solution, ANAM4 has been developed, tested, implemented, and deployed for 9 years. Access to this product ensures continuation of the critical pre-deployment assessments, post-deployment assessments, and the assessment of injured service members. Inability to use the ANAM4 tool would debilitate the Services' abilities to provide for Traumatic Brain Injury/Behavioral Health (TBI/BH) screening at all echelons of healthcare. Accurately and efficiently monitoring the neurocognitive status of U.S. war fighters under diverse operational and experimental conditions is of critical importance to the ongoing mission and network-centered initiatives of the United States military. These screenings are a mandatory requirement for all Service members. <br />The use of ANAM4 software is essential to the Government's requirements, and thereby precludes consideration of another product. In accordance with the Department of Defense Instruction <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">(DoDI) 6490.13, September 11, 2015</span>, the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM4) is the DoD-designated neurocognitive assessment tool supporting the policy requirement to implement a comprehensive neurocognitive assessment program in the military. Vista Partners, LLC is the only contractor that can provide its proprietary services and equipment for ANAM4 Neurocognitive Assessment Tool (NCAT). <br />Items being purchased in this acquisition: <br />ANAM4 Licenses/ Maintenance for both Laptop and Tablet devices (Base period with four option periods) <br />This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures. There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 511210 with a Small Business Size Standard of $38.5M. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, any parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable system is provided by Vista Partners LLC. <br />Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Jeffrey Sprecher at jeffrey.b.sprecher.civ@mail.mil. Statements are due no later than 4:00 P.M. EST on 25 January 2019. No phone calls accepted.<br /></span></p>

This is a notice that this requirement is for Full and Open Competition.<br />2. Basis for Award. 325 CONS/PKAC will issue a purchase order to the vendor who is<br />determined to offer the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) to the Government. Failure to<br />acknowledge amendments may result in your quote not being considered for award.<br />3. LPTA Determination. The Government will conduct a complete price analysis on the Lowest<br />Priced Technically Acceptable offer, to determine if proposed prices are reasonable and balanced.<br />All proposed prices for all contract periods will be evaluated for reasonableness, which may be<br />determined based on prices submitted by competition, historical pricing, current market conditions,<br />comparison to the Independent Government Estimate, and/or other proposal analysis techniques.<br />The Government may require submission of information other than cost or pricing data to the<br />extent necessary to evaluate price reasonableness. Technical acceptability will be determined by an<br />evaluation of the quoted requirements that meet the criteria contained in the solicitation. If the<br />lowest priced submission does not meet the technical criteria described within the solicitation, the<br />government reserves the right to evaluate the next lowest priced submissions until an offer has been<br />determined a technically acceptable submission. The evaluation will stop at the point when the<br />government determines an offeror to be technically acceptable with the lowest evaluated price; that<br />offer will represent the best value. Contingent upon a determination of contractor responsibility,<br />award will be made to that offeror without further evaluation of other offers. Award will be made<br />to the responsible vendor whose quote is the lowest evaluated price among technically acceptable<br />quotes.<br />4. Discussions. The government intends to award a purchase order without discussions with<br />respective vendors/quotes. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if<br />deemed in its best interests.<br />5. Mandatory Registrations.

<DESC>Background: <br />The Department of Defense (DoD) is required by law (10 U.S.C. &sect; 1074g) to establish an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program for the Military Health System (MHS) which includes the purchase pharmaceutical agents. The law and implementing regulation (32 CFR Section 199.21) describe the process by which the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee will consider the relative clinical effectiveness and relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class in recommending the selection of agents for the DoD Uniform Formulary (UF) and, for cost sharing purposes, the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, Basic Core Formulary (BCF), Extended Core Formulary (ECF), or non-formulary (NF). Prior to the scheduled P&amp;T Committee meeting, a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for pharmaceutical agents within Drug Classes identified for placement on the UF has been issued to obtain quotes from industry. The Defense Health Agency may award Uniform Formulary Blanket Purchase Agreements (UF BPA) and the Uniform Formulary Additional Discount Program Agreements (UF ADP) based on the UF decision. This process is described in the attached RFQ.
<p>P&amp;T COMMITTEE MEETING: February 2019: The following drug classes/subclass and newly approved agents will be reviewed: <br /><br />Antifungals - NA: Tolsura<br /><br />GI-2 - Miscellaneous: Aemcolo <br /><br />Corticosteroids-Immune Modulators - High Potency: Bryhali <br /><br />Neurological Agents Miscellaneous - NA: Firdapse <br /><br />Antimalarials - NA: Krintafel <br /><br />Corticosteroids-Immune Modulators - High Potency: Lexette <br /><br />Antibiotics - Tetracyclines: Nuzyra <br /><br />Antihistamine-1 - First Gen and Combo: Ryclora <br /><br />Antibiotics - Tetracyclines: Seysara</p>
<p>RFQ: The RFQ, including UF BPA and UF ADP appendices are attached herein. <br />There is no pre-proposal teleconference. Rather, questions shall be submitted via e-mail to the Request for Quote (RFQ) Point of Contact stated in Part 2.3, no later than the date stated in Part 2.4. Also, responses to Part 3.4 is required.</p>
<p>POCs: Part 2.3 of the RFQ. <br />For additional information, search DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee at http://www.health.mil/POD</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Exam Shorts, Disposable. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO DHA is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Exam Shorts, Disposable products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Exam Shorts, Disposable in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Exam Shorts, Disposable will be established approximately June 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately July 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Exam Shorts, Disposable. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Exam Shorts, Disposable.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Exam Shorts, Disposable. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $420,769. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Three items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 97.53% ($410,370) of the total volume in sales ($420,769). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.</strong><br />1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin. Only ONE Vendor Part Number (PN) should be provided for each item/sample.

EXAM SHORTS, DISPOSABLE, NONWOVEN, ELASTIC WAIST, BLUE, 2X-LARGE<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Evaluation</span><br />After the lead MMESO receives all information required above, they will send each vendor making a complete and approved submission a written request to provide product samples to the Evaluation Site Leader (ESL) at the participating MTFs. MTF "Ship to" Addresses will be provided as part of the request. <strong>To ensure your eligibility to participate, all products required for evaluation must be shipped no later than 14 calendar days from issuance of the MMESO's request and must arrive at all designated MTFs no later than 5:00 PM local time at delivery location, 20 calendar days from issuance of the MMESO's request.</strong> Products received after the stated date and time will not be included in review to establish the QSL nor will these products participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. Products arriving after stated deadline will be destroyed upon receipt.<br /><br />Vendor will provide only the following products for evaluation. The products will be provided at no cost to the government for products or delivery, and unused products will not be returned. Five each of the commercially packaged items listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as requested by the Lead MMESO.

A vendor who provides all requested information and meets the requirements will be selected for inclusion in the QSL. Vendors will be notified of whether they met or did not meet the QSL requirements by approximately June&nbsp;2019.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Points of Contact (POCs):</span><br />MMESO DHA Team Leader Ms. Shatema Mills, 301-619-6819, shatema.d.mills.ctr@mail.mil, and MMESO DHA Clinical Analyst Mr. Stephen Ito, stephen.m.ito.ctr@mail.mil, 301-619-4415.

DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately July 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Laryngoscope Products, Reusable. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Laryngoscope Products, Reusable.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Laryngoscope Products, Reusable. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $253,411. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Three items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100% ($253,411) of the total volume in sales $253,411. The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>INDEFINITE DELIVERY CONTRACT (IDC) FOR (A-E) GIS/MAPPING SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF SURVEYING AND PHOTOGRAMMETRIC MAPPING SERVICES IN EUCOM AOR</p>
<p>1. AGENCY: United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Europe District (CENAU).</p>
<p>2. NAICS CODE: 541370 - Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services</p>
<p>3. PLACES OF PERFORMANCE: Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Greece, Turkey, Germany, Spain, Israel, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, and Croatia.</p>
<p>4. CONTRACT INFORMATION:<br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Europe District (CENAU), intends to solicit and award a target of five Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDCs) for Architect and Engineering (A-E) Services in the European Command (EUCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) countries listed above in paragraph 3; to be procured in accordance with Public Law (PL) 92-582 (the Brooks Act) and Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36, under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 541370, Surveying and Mapping Services. The amount of work for the contracts shall not exceed $49,000,000 in combined capacity which will be shared among the awardees. This acquisition is needed to support the continued and growing CENAU missions in the EUCOM AOR listed above.</p>
<p>The contract will be negotiated and awarded as Firm Fixed Price (FFP). Funds are not presently available for this acquisition. No contract award will be made until funds are made available.</p>
<p>Performance Period: The contracts will have one base ordering period of five years.</p>
<p>Anticipated Award: The anticipated award is April 2019.</p>
<p>Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. When two (2) or more indefinite delivery contracts (IDCs) available to the procuring agency contain the same or overlapping scopes of work so that a particular task order might be issued under more than one IDC, the contracting officer will have available for consideration the following factors in deciding which contractor will be selected to negotiate an order:</p>
<p>&bull; Performance and quality of deliverables under current contracts;<br />&bull; Current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time;<br />&bull; Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;<br />&bull; Uniquely specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required;</p>
<p>FAR Part 19 Small Business Programs is not applicable outside of the United States or its territories and setting aside solicitations for SB may conflict with international agreements, therefore, this acquisition will not be set aside. However, if your firm is qualified to perform the services please submit a proposal by the requested due date and time.</p>
<p>5. PROJECT INFORMATION: <br />The A-E services are expected to include, but will not be limited to the following: manned aircraft aerial photography, photogrammetry (aerotriangulation, stereo compilation, orthophotography) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing data collection and processing of both large and small project sites, with requisite land surveying to support aerial missions. The contract may also require site (existing conditions) and utility (to include subsurface) surveys, CAD/GIS mapping, CAD/GIS data migration/consolidation, data linkage, database development, data scanning and archiving, real property support, and space utilization surveys. For more detailed project information reference Attachment 3 - Section C Statement of Work.<br /><br />6. SELECTION CRITERIA: <br />The selection criteria listed below are in descending order of importance. The above mentioned Places of Performance and Project Information will be considered in evaluation of all criteria.</p>
<p>a) FACTOR 1: SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE (FAR 36.602-1(a)(2)): Submittals must demonstrate the specialized experience and technical competence of the prime firm, joint venture partners, consultants, key subcontractors and/or free-lance associates. The Offeror shall submit a maximum of ten projects total. All ten projects shall be at least 90% complete (from the date of this announcement), or have been completed within the last six years from date of the announcement. If more than ten projects are submitted, only the first ten projects listed in the proposal will be evaluated. Projects shall include the following information: which prime firm, partner, consultant or key subcontractor executed the project, a description/narrative/ photos of the project, scope, location, contract dollar award amount and final dollar cost, the start date, original contract finish date, the actual finish date, customer POC with current phone number and email information. Indicate whether the work was performed as the prime contractor, a subcontractor, or as a partner of a Joint Venture (JV). If work was performed as a subcontractor or JV partner, clearly describe what part of the work the firm for which the experience information is submitted performed (both in magnitude and description of the work performed). Projects shall also list any key personnel that worked on the submitted projects. Indefinite-Delivery Contracts (IDC), where numerous Task Orders are listed together for the exact same project and are completed under the same base contract IDC are acceptable.</p>
<p>If the experience of key subcontractors is offered for any experience requirements, then a letter of commitment between the A-E firm or joint venture partnership and the subcontractor is required. The letter of commitment MUST be signed by both parties to be considered and an English version/translation must be provided. Please see Attachment 1 for an example Letter of Commitment. If the Letter of Commitment is not submitted or signed by both parties, the Experience of the subcontractor will not be considered.</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 EVALUATION: The Government will evaluate the specialized experience of a firm based on projects and technical capabilities that demonstrate the items identified in the project information above for the prime firm and committed key subcontractors.</p>
<p>b) FACTOR 2: PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1)): The A-E firm must identify the qualifications of personnel in the following key disciplines: Program Manager, Project Manager, Photogrammetrist, Professional Land Surveyor, GIS Manager, CADD Manager. Offerors must propose at least one person for each of the key disciplines; an individual may not be proposed for multiple disciplines.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 EVALUATION: The Government will evaluate and consider the education, training, professional registration, certification, language ability (at a minimum English), overall and relevant experience and longevity with the proposed team for all the key personnel proposed. Submittals should demonstrate that the firm's staff is capable of certifying that all work is in compliance with all applicable codes and regulations.</p>
<p>c) FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE (FAR 36.602-1(A)(4)): Offerors shall submit the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) evaluation for the projects submitted in Factor 1. If no CPARS or PPIRS evaluation is available for a project, Attachment Two (2), Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ), shall be submitted to the client for the projects the Offeror includes in its proposal for the Factor Specialized Experience and Technical Competence. The CPARS, PPIRS or PPQ shall be included in the submittal. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown (or "neutral") past performance.</p>
<p>Offerors may also include performance recognition documents received within the last six (6) years, such as awards, award fee determinations, customer letters of commendation, commercial and foreign government evaluations and any other forms of performance recognition. To the extent such documentation is not in the English language, a translation must be provided in order for the documentation to be considered.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the PPIRS, including CPARS, using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, JV, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the Offeror's proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the Offeror.</p>
<p>While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror and the government is under no obligation to check other sources.</p>
<p>FACTOR 3 EVALUATION: Past Performance of the A-E, joint venture, partners, and key subcontractors on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules as determined from the PPIRS, completed PPQs (see Attachment 2 for a blank form) and other sources will be evaluated. Incomplete and unsigned PPQs will not be considered. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance to determine how relevant project work is, as described in Factor 1 Specialized Experience and Technical Competence. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's performance to determine a confidence assessment of the Offeror's performance. With respect to relevancy, more relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor of future performance and have more influence on the past performance confidence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance.</p>

Only awards of A-E contracts will be considered but includes awards to all branch offices of a company, except as indicated in Defense PGI 236.602-1(a)(6)(A)(2). This criterion will be used to determine equitable distribution of DoD contracts. The Government will evaluate the number of contracts awarded to the firm using various contracting systems which may include but is not limited to Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS-NG), Electronic Document Access (EDA) and Procurement Desktop Defense (PD2).

<p>How to submit your proposal:<br />a. Electronic Proposals. In an effort to reduce paperwork and costs, ALL RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHALL BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY. Hand carried delivery or USPS/UPS/Fedex delivery of hard copies and/or CD-ROMs are not authorized. Facsimile submission is not authorized. Email submission is not authorized. ELECTRONIC PROPOSAL SUBMISSION IS REQUIRED THROUGH THE FEDBIZOPPS (FBO.GOV) "ELECTRONIC RESPONSE" FEATURE. The FBO vendor user guide has information &amp; instructions on how to utilize this feature. The FBO vendor user guide is accessible via the following web URL: https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf.</p>
<p>b. File Size Limitations. Offerors are advised to follow the FBO instructions for uploading files larger than 10MB (java upload). FBO has not posted official file size limitations for its electronic response module, however it has been observed that uploads to FBO tend to be problematic when the files are sized 100MB or greater. If needed, Offerors are advised to break the files down into smaller sections in order to upload it to the system. In such cases, please divide the sections as logically as possible and be sure to clearly name the files as specified below.</p>
<p>c. File Names. To ensure your submission is received and processed appropriately, it is important that interested parties CAREFULLY ensure their electronic files adhere to the following naming convention: Each filename shall begin with the solicitation number, followed by the word "RESPONSE", followed by your firm's name, and finally a brief file description.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:<br />(1) "W912XXFYRXXXX RESPONSE Firmname Volume I.pdf"</p>
<p>d. File Organization, Formatting, and other instructions. Although hard copies are not accepted, each file shall be clearly indexed, and logically assembled. Font size shall be 10 or larger. Pages shall be letter sized--larger page sizes (such as 11x17 foldouts, etc.) will be counted as two pages. Offerors shall prepare proposals in the English language. Proposals shall be in a narrative format, organized and titled so that each section of the proposal follows the order and format of the factors. Information presented should be organized so as to pertain to only the evaluation factor in the section that the information is presented. Information pertaining to more than one evaluation factor should be repeated in the each section for each factor. Electronic files shall be Microsoft Windows compatible. Files shall be submitted in their native format (i.e. doc, xls, ppt, etc.), or if in pdf format, shall be in searchable text. If the electronic files are of a size at which they must be compressed (zipped), they shall be compressed into one zipped folder.</p>
<p>e. Upload Completion &amp; Deadline. Interested parties shall submit responses no later than the date specified on solicitation document. The time &amp; date of proposal receipt will be the upload completion / delivery time &amp; date recorded within FBO. Do not assume that electronic submission will occur instantaneously. Large files (e.g. 10MB or more) will take some time to upload. Offerors should time their upload effort with prudence by not waiting until the last few minutes-this will allow for unexpected delays in the transmittal process and troubleshooting. Proposal submission difficulties should be coordinated with the Federal Service Desk at https://fsd.gov and/or +1-866-606-8220 (Mon-Fri 8am-8pm Eastern Time UTC -5:00). Experience shows that if an upload doesn't complete until after the deadline, the FBO system WILL NOT COMPLETE. The FBO system will automatically shut off the "Electronic Submission" feature at the specified deadline--once that occurs, the feature will disappear from the announcement. Offerors are encouraged to keep a copy of the upload confirmation for their record. Submissions after the deadline will be considered late and as such will be processed in accordance with FAR 15.208.</p>
<p>f. Any information, presented in a proposal that the Offeror wants safeguarded from disclosure to other parties must be identified and labeled in accordance with the requirements of Provision "FAR 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors&#61630;Competitive Acquisition (Jan 2004)," subparagraph (e). The Government will endeavor to honor the restrictions against release requested by Offerors, to the extent permitted under United States law and regulations.</p>

<p>PURCHASE HISTORY: 8 JUN 2018 - SPRTA118C1269 - QTY 56 EA - CAGE 78943</p>
<p>QUALIFIED SOURCE(S): UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION DBA PRATT &amp; WHITNEY MILITARY ENGINES DIV. - CAGE 52661, TRIUMPH THERMAL SYSTEMS, CAGE 78943</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 60 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.</p>
<p><br />While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer, Deborah Marks 405-855-7070, deborah.marks.2@us.af.mil.</p>

<p>1. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This procurement is set aside in accordance with FAR Part 19, with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 333120, with a size standard of 1,250 employees. In accordance with DFAR 215.203-70 a Tiered Evaluation will be utilized with the following order of precedence:</p>
<p>i. Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), <br />ii. Small Business (SB), <br />iii. Unrestricted</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 19.14, award will be made on a competitive basis to eligible (responsible and technically acceptable) SDVOSB concerns, provided that a minimum of two (2) competitive offers are received from a SDVOSB. If a minimum of two (2) competitive offers from eligible SDVOSB concerns are not received, any award will be made on a competitive basis to eligible small business concerns in accordance with FAR 19.5 provided that a minimum of two (2) competitive offers are received from eligible small business concerns. If a minimum of two (2) competitive offers from eligible small business concerns are not received, any award covered by this solicitation will be made on the basis of full and open competition from among all eligible business concerns submitting offers.</p>
<p>The Small Business Administration has granted a class waiver to the "Non-Manufacturer Rule" (FAR 19.102(f)) for this NAICS, therefore, a small business offeror 1) may furnish the supplies of a large domestic manufacturer, 2) may have no more than 1,250 employees, and 3) is not subject to usual limitations on subcontracting (FAR clause 52.219-14). By submitting an offer under this solicitation, the offeror certifies that it fully complies with the provisions set forth above.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">PAFB is an Air Force installation located in Brevard County, Florida, on a barrier island on the central East Coast. The City of Satellite Beach is south of the installation and the City of Cocoa Beach is north. Brevard County comprises an area of 1,557 square miles; about 20 miles wide and 72 miles long along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. The county is low lying and ranges from 6 feet above sea level at Merritt Island to the west to 26 feet above sea level within the City of Cocoa to the northwest. Approximately 3,100 Air Force military personnel, 1,700 Air Force civilian personnel, and 5,700 contractor personnel work at PAFB and CCAFS. No personnel live on CCAFS as housing for military personnel is available at PAFB, together with other personnel support functions. Area demographics indicate that in 2008 approximately 14,000 military retirees lived in Brevard County. Brevard County's 2009 estimated population was 555,657.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The primary function of PAFB is to assure access to space through administration of space launch operations at CCAFS. Base operational areas include the airfield with 9,000-foot primary and 3,700-foot crosswind runways and related apron and taxiways serving military and governmental tenants, an administrative center, three residential areas, base operational and maintenance support areas, a retail/medical community support area, and numerous recreational facilities including a golf course, marina, campground, beach facilities and trails.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">In 1940, the U.S. Navy activated the installation as the Banana River Naval Air Station. The installation served as a base for World War II anti-submarine patrol planes. In 1947, the installation was deactivated and subsequently transferred to the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1948. The installation was renamed Patrick Air Force Base in 1950 in honor of Major General Mason M. Patrick, who served as Chief of the U.S. Army Air Service from 1921 to 1927. The Air Force began developing the Eastern Test Range beginning in 1950 with PAFB as its headquarters and support base of operations. Air Force Space Command, (AFSPC) assumed responsibility for USAF space launch operations in October 1990. The Eastern Test Range has since been re-designated the Eastern Range, with the 14th Air Force at Vandenberg AFB CA, overseeing the 45 SW. The Eastern Range extends over 10,000 miles from the Florida mainland through the south Atlantic into the Indian Ocean. The Eastern Range includes the launch head at CCAFS and a network of downrange instrumentation stations - Malabar and Jonathan Dickinson Missile Tracking annexes, Antigua Air Station and Ascension Auxiliary Air Field. The 45th Space Wing (45 SW) is the host organization for the installation; tenant organizations include US State Department, Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, Air Force Technical Applications Center, US Army Corps of Engineers, Civil Air Patrol, and many others.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">CCAFS is an Air Force installation located along the Atlantic Coast of Brevard County, Florida and adjacent to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center (KSC). CCAFS is situated on the Canaveral Peninsula, which is a barrier island approximately 155 miles south of Jacksonville, 210 miles north of Miami, and approximately 60 miles east of Orlando. The northern boundary of CCAFS abuts KSC and the southern boundary abuts Port Canaveral. CCAFS is bounded to the east by the Atlantic Ocean and to the west by the Banana River Lagoon. CCAFS occupies approximately 15,800 acres of land. Approximately 3,100 Air Force military personnel, 1,700 Air Force civilian personnel, and 5,700 contractor personnel work at the PAFB and CCAFS. No personnel live on CCAFS as housing for military personnel is available at PAFB, together with other personnel support functions.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">CCAFS provides space launch capability for government, civil, and commercial satellites. CCAFS also provides launch facilities, property and services to support NASA, commercial space operations, and Naval Ordnance Test Unit (NOTU). CCAFS is within a Commercial Launch Zone and this designation promotes the development of national and international aerospace business in Florida. The 45th Space Wing (45 SW) is the host organization for the installation; major tenant organizations include Customs and Border Protection, Military Sealift Command, Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, NASA, NOTU. Non-Federal tenants include Space Florida, SpaceX, and United Launch Alliance.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">CCAFS also serves as the control area and launch head for the Eastern Range as well as being a major part of the 45 SW Major Range and Test Facility Base, of which NOTU is a major DoD user. The Eastern Range consists of CCAFS, PAFB, Ascension Auxiliary Airfield, Antigua Air Station, the Florida Annexes and off-base meteorological instrumentation sites. The Eastern Range operations are directed through the Morrell Operations Center, which supports flight safety, weather, scheduling and instrumentation operations for each missile and space launch on the Eastern Range.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Long Range Proving Ground on Cape Canaveral was established in 1949 under jurisdiction of the Air Force. In the same year, the Naval Air Station, located 20 miles to the south of the Cape, was reactivated and renamed PAFB. Since then, the test range and its management agent have undergone several name changes from the Air Force Missile Test Center to the Air Force Eastern Test Range, the Eastern Test Range, the Space and Missile Test Center, and the Eastern Space and Missile Center. On 1 October 1990, AFSPC assumed responsibility for USAF space launch operations. On 12 November 1991, the ESMC was inactivated, and the 45 SW was activated as a result of restructuring throughout the Air Force. The Eastern Test Range has since been re-designated as the Eastern Range. AFSPC oversees the 45 SW ER, the 14th Air Force at Vandenberg AFB, CA and the 30th SW Western Range.</span></p>

<DESC>This Amendment is to provide additional clarifications to the offerors:
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>1) Question</strong>: The Government shutdown has impacted many of our clients' availability to complete the Past Performance Questionnaire. This not only impacts us directly, but also our subcontractors as well. If the shutdown ends this week, then point would be moot. However, in the event that the shutdown continues into next week, can the bidders simply provide their CPARS and other requested information in lieu of having clients (whom are not available due to shutdown) complete pages 2 of the Questionnaire?
<p><strong>Response</strong>: Please keep in mind that per FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), "In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance." Government can search for the offeror's CPARS/PPIRS information independently.</p>
<p><strong>2) Question</strong>: Page 80 of the RFP appears as though the Government is requesting 2 key personnel for the Research Psychologists/Human Factors Specialist category, but Attachment J.2 indicates only one category in the spreadsheet. Which is it? Is FHWA be willing to modify the J.2 template to include lines for 2 Key/1 Non-Key Research Psychologist/HF Specialist? As FHWA has requested 2 Key and 1 Non-Key, we would need 3 discrete labor rates.&nbsp;<br /><strong> Response</strong>: Please follow the instructions outlined in Attachment J.2. Please do not include additional categories or change/modify attachment J.2.</p>

Interested firms should submit their current SF-330, Parts I and II, to Nicholas.Winne@va.gov.  The SF-330s are due no later than 4:00 PM, EDT, February 15, 2019.  

SCOPE OF WORK: 
The project includes design and construction period services for replacing the primary boilers serving the Albany VAMC main hospital.  The goal of the project is to improve the boiler plant reliability and efficiency.    The primary boilers to be replaced include three (3) 800 HP dual fired steam water-tube boilers operating at 120 psig that date to 1978.  A newer 400 HP fire-tube steam boiler is anticipated to remain in service.  The existing boilers provide high pressure steam for a combination of process loads (sterilization, kitchen, humidification, and laundry) and building heat (steam convectors and heating hot water). 

The AE shall conduct an engineering survey of the project to:
Test and locate all asbestos-containing materials within the affected areas of the building required to implement boiler equipment replacements, including planned rigging paths for equipment replacements. Remediation measures to remove ACM shall be included in the design documents. 
Determine current and projected Steam and Heating Hot Water loads for the hospital.
Provide temporary steam and heating hot water metering for a minimum of 30 days to provide accurate hourly and daily profiles of consumption, compared against outside air temperatures in order to ascertain probable maximum and minimum loads throughout the year.
Review Boiler logs and hourly gas meter data
Conduct interviews with boiler operators and other VA staff 
Include potential impact of new combined heat and power (CHP) plant hot water contribution on boiler operations.  
Inspect and verify that the existing ancillary boiler equipment not included in the replacement scope (including but not limited to: boiler feed water pumps and piping, blowdown systems, fuel oil systems, steam piping, etc.) are in compliance with applicable Codes, Standards (VA and National) and the VHA Boiler Plant Safety Device Testing Manual - Fourth Edition.   Access if this ancillary supporting equipment and systems are satisfactory for re-use with a minimum of 10 years additional service life providing collaborating details and photos supporting the assessment.    Survey results identifying deficiencies w/technical solutions shall be incorporated into the design documents.
A report on the engineering survey results shall be submitted for approval in advance of the 35% design submission.  
 
 
 
The AE shall prepare a report for 35% submission that includes:

The A/E shall perform all work necessary to prepare the specifications, drawings, bidding documents, and provide construction period services for the subject project.  The design shall follow all VA/VHA Standards, VA Design Manuals, VHA Directives, Federal Energy Management Programs, as well as local, state, and federal codes. The A/E shall perform all work necessary to prepare the specifications, drawings, bidding documents, and provide construction period services for the subject project.

Throughout the design phase and construction phase, the A/E shall produce and maintain all meeting minutes. Meeting Minutes shall be submitted to the VA for concurrence within three (3) working days after a meeting. The A/E shall provide written response to design comments from the previous phases of design prior to submission of the succeeding phase submission within 7 working days of receipt of the Comments from the VA. Incomplete responses are grounds for rejection. Failure to incorporate all documented VA comments into succeeding phase submissions are grounds for rejection.  Invoices for work performed cannot be submitted until verification of design comments have been demonstrated to be incorporated into design documents and accepted by the COR.  
  
Prior to the submission of the un-reviewed final drawings and specifications, the A/E shall conduct a narrative walk-through with the COR for each of the trades included in the project to demonstrate that the work shown on the drawings can be physically constructed as depicted. The trades shall include, but not be limited to architectural, structural, plumbing, HVAC, fire protection and electrical. The designer for each trade shall be present at the walk-through which will encompass all of the physical areas affected by the project. Individual walk-through may be conducted for specific trades. Upon completion of the walk-through, the VA will give direction to the A/E whether the design may proceed to completion as shown or whether some redesign is necessary. The walk-through shall be scheduled by the A/E in a manner that will allow corrections before the un-reviewed final submission due date. Required corrections will not excuse the A/E from submitting the un-reviewed final drawings and specifications on time.

All designs will follow, but not be limited to, the VA HVAC Design Manual, Steam & Heating Hot Water Design Manual and Sustainable Design Manuals in conjunction with the VA Master specifications. The design will be completed in a manner such that the estimated construction cost is within the VA budget. 



OFFERORS WILL BE EVALUATED ON THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
The submitted SF-330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:
This acquisition will be in accordance with FAR Part 36.602-1 and VAAR Part 836.602-1. The following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate SF-330 technical proposals:

The A/E must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation criteria for all services. Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria (5) and (6) are of slightly less importance than (1) through (4), but are equal value among themselves; Criteria (7) and (8) are the least important and listed in descending order of importance. Specific evaluation criteria include:

1. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required,  including, 
where appropriate, experience in central plant design, high pressure steam systems, energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.
 2.  Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.
 3.  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.
 4.  Past Performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.
5.  Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.
6.  Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
7.  Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.
 8.  Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete  architectural and engineering services.

Criterion 1 - Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials. Offerors will be evaluated on specialized experience and technical competence in the performance of services similar to those anticipated under this contract with regard to:

Central Plant Designs of similar size
Evaluating steam load profiles and selecting boilers for optimum operating efficiency 
Knowledge of high pressure boiler plant auxiliary equipment 
Experience with retrofit projects in healthcare facilities
Experience in providing post construction award services (shop drawing review, as-built drawing and Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) preparation, construction inspection services, and Operating and Maintenance Manuals).

Submission requirements: Provide up to five (5) projects completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years that best illustrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above. Example projects shall note project s square footage. All projects provided in the SF-330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and/or perform work under this contract. To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF-330 Part 1, Section F Item 25  Firms from Section C Involved in this Project,  block (1). Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21. Include an e-mail address, and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c). Include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above. If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work they provided towards the performance of the overall project. If a project was performed by a joint venture, and not all joint venture partners are on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract. Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) projects for this criterion. Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project. Instead, list relevant completed task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above. Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.
Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being rated lower.

All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in Part 1, Section F of the SF-330. The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part 1, Section F in evaluating Criterion 1.

Criterion 2 - Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.  Offerors will be evaluated in terms of the qualifications, competence and experience of the key personnel and technical team proposed to accomplish this work. Key personnel are individuals who will have major contract or project management responsibilities and/or will provide unusual or unique expertise. Provide a balanced licensed and or certified workforce in the following disciplines   
Architecture, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, and Fire Protection Engineering 

Submission requirements: Provide resumes for all proposed key personnel. Resumes are limited to one page each and should cite project specific experience and indicate proposed role in this contract. Provide professional registration, certification, licensure and/or accreditation. Indicate participation of key personnel in example projects in the SF-330 Part 1 Section G.

Criterion 3 - Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Firms/teams will be evaluated in terms of their ability to plan for and manage work under the contract and capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.

Submission requirements: Describe the firm s ability to concurrently perform and manage multiple projects in different locations to meet aggressive schedules, multiple disciplines, and control costs and the firm s capacity to accomplish multiple projects simultaneously. 

Criterion 4 - Past Performance   Offerors will be evaluated on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.  Evaluating past performance and experience will include information provided in Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) or CPARS/ACASS for Criterion 1 projects and may include other information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criteria. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being rated lower. NOTE: Past performance information for projects listed under Criterion 1.

Submission requirements: SUBMIT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION FOR EACH PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1. IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in this notice is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion 1.  AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS IS AVAILABLE. IF A CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF-330. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, offerors should complete and submit with their responses the first page of the PPQ (Attachment), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s). Offerors may submit a PPQ previously submitted under a different Notice/RFP (legible copies are acceptable) as long as it is on the same form as posted with this Synopsis.  Offerors should follow up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If requested by the client, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Network Contracting Office 2 Attn: Nicholas Winne via email at Nicholas.Winne@va.gov prior to the response date.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their response PPQs or CPARS previously submitted in response to other A/E services procurements. However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation.

Evaluation Scoring

Evaluation factors 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will be evaluated using the following adjectival ratings as follows:

Outstanding: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low. 
Good: Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low. 
Acceptable: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate.  
Marginal: Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high. 
Unacceptable: Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is not awardable. The firm s proposal demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement and the approach fails to meet performance standards. The firm s proposal has major omissions and inadequate details to assure evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of requirement.

The ratings identified below were used in the evaluation of Past Performance (Criterion 4):

Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they can satisfy the requirements of the contract.

Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Little doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they could satisfy the requirements of the contract.
Unknown Confidence (Neutral): No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.
Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Some doubt exists based on past performance that they could satisfy the terms and conditions of the contract.
No Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectations that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Significant doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they can satisfy the requirements of the contract.
SELECTION INTERVIEW:
Interviews shall be scheduled with firms slated as the most highly qualified. Firms slated for interviews may be asked to explain or expand on information contained in the SF-330 submittal through a formal interview or a discussion questionnaire as determined by the Contracting Officer. 

GENERAL INFORMATION:
