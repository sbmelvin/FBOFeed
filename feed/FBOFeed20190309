The technical evaluation criteria set forth below have been developed by the program office and have been tailored to their requirements in this particular solicitation. The offeror is informed that these criteria, (1) serve as the standard against which all quotes will be evaluated and (2) serve to identify the significant matters which the offeror should specifically address in complying with the requirements of this solicitation.</p>

<p>The contractor will provide a technical overview of their abilities to perform the services herein. The technical proposal must address the technical factors described herein.

A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br /> <br />(End of Provision)<br /> <br />52.237-1 -- Site Visit (APR 1984)<br /> <br />Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable.

<CONTACT>Danielle Wood, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-2016-6279 ext 276, Email WoodDK@state.gov - SAMUEL J. SULA, PROCUREMENT AGENT, Phone 2022166279304, Email SulaSJ@state.gov
<DESC>Below are the questions regarding the solicitation package for real estate consulting services?
<p>1.	The name of the incumbent and if they are a local company?</p>
<p>This is a new solicitation.</p>
<p>2.	How many people are currently working on this project?</p>
<p>This is a new solicitation.</p>
<p>3.	Are bids being accepted by American based companies?</p>
<p>Bids will be accepted by companies regardless of national origin. Companies must meet the requirements outlined in the solicitation.</p>
<p>4.	Can these bids be submitted electronically?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>5.	Will there be any VAT associated with this contract?</p>
<p>All companies are expected to comply with local laws, to include any tax requirements.</p>
<p>6.	Do we need real estate license in South Sudan?</p>
<p>All offerors must be able to perform the work proposed in accordance with local regulations.</p>
<p>7.	And finally what was the contract value?</p>
<p>This is a new solicitation. <br />8.	The solicitation page in fbo.gov indicates that submission can be done electronically through email but the solicitation document requests a hand delivery. will the USG be flexible to receive offers through email?</p>
<p>Solicitations may be sent via email.</p>
<p>9.	 The technical requirement indicate "adequate financial resources" will a declaration of the revenue of our activity in East Africa will be sufficient to meet this requirement?</p>
<p>Adequate financial resources must be demonstrated. Contracting Officer is unable to make a determination as to whether a particular declaration will meet this requirement.</p>
<p>10.	The technical requirement indicates "Satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics". can you elaborate what is your specific requirement here, is there any document/s you would like us to demonstrate to satisfy this requirement?<br />The USG reserves the right to review financial and business relationships of entities in determining suitability and satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics. Some examples would include the UN sanctions list. <br />11.	 Is DBA insurance required?<br />No work will be done on existing USG premises. DBA insurance is not required. <br />12.	The Solicitation on page 29 indicates that this is an FFP contract, which is aligned with the SOW page 3, schedule of deliverables. Which the vendor will provide a set of services within 30 days of task order issuance. In the SOW section 10.5 indicate payment to be made following the acceptance of the report and it also states that "A supplemental invoices may be submitted upon completion of any field support services that occur after the final site search report delivered"   Since the contract is for 1 year and FFP quote is for the deliverable provided within 30 days of order issuance, is it to indicate this is a hybrid FFP and Time and Materials contract?</p>
<p>The government is only soliciting for FFP contract for real estate services at this time.</p>
<p>13.	To eliminate risk and adhere to the required quality of service, can we suggest the USG/DoS to have complementary services in the form of field work or other legal consultancies such as ownership investigation to be under time and materials, in addition, to the FFP offer?<br />This will remain a FFP solicitation. <br />14.	 Since this solicitation is not published in the DoS 2019 forecast, Public Law 100-656, the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988, amended the Small Business Act to place new emphasis on acquisition planning. The law requires agencies to compile and make available projections of contracting opportunities small firms may be able to perform. Although this is least price, technically accepted solicitation, To increase our market access, can you indicate your budget or the solicitation order of magnitude?<br />No. The USG is seeking competitive quotes for the SOW from qualified offerors. <br />15.	Is the embassy willing to work with a company or an individual as regards the brokerage services?<br />The USG is seeking competitive quotes for the SOW from qualified offerors. All offers will be assessed to determine technical competence based on submitted documents.</p>
