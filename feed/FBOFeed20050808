Questions concerning this solicitation should be directed to Debra A. Keith via e-mail at dkeith@mp.usbr.gov. The principal components of the work to be performed under the specifications include the following:   A.  General Requirements - Administrative requirements, procedural requirements, temporary facilities, and controls which apply to the execution of work. B.  Schedule A - Schedule A of Phase II of the American River Pump Station project consists of Primary and Emergency river intake structures, an Obermeyer-type maintenance gate, channel and cofferdam grading, channel erosions protection measures including grouted rock and riprap, intake structure access roads and surfaces, hatches up to 8 feet by 12 feet in size, air and water piping from the pump station to the intake contained in a utility trench and a concrete-encased 48-inch diameter casing pipe beneath the river for future extension of the 30-inch diameter GDPUD pipeline from the pump station to the south side of the river.  The river intake structures will provide water to the American River Pump Station constructed under Phase I and are to be constructed on the north bank of the American River channel directly beneath the pump station. 1.  Primary Intake Structures - The Primary Intake structure consists of a reinforced concrete and grouted boulder chute with tilted, wedge-wire intake screens and air backwash.  Collection chambers beneath the screens deliver diverted water to six 30-inch diameter reinforced concrete pipes.  The concrete pipes carry diversions to the Intake Vault at the existing pump station tunnel entrance and are controlled by manually operated knife-gate valves. 2.  Emergency Intake Structure - The Emergency intake will consist of a coarse bar screen divided into four separate chambers.  Each of the four chambers discharges to a concrete box collection conduit behind the intake through various sized openings.  The collection conduit varies in size from 3.5 foot by 3.5 foot to 6 foot by 6 foot.  Flows collected in the collection conduit are controlled by a manually operated 6 foot by 6 foot cast iron sluice gate.  The sluice gate discharges to a maintenance and sedimentation vault which in turn discharges to a 7 foot by 7 cast-in-place Emergency Intake Conduit.  The Emergency Intake conduit extends approximately 80 feet to the Intake Vault at the existing pump station tunnel entrance. 3.  Maintenance Gate - A 16 foot wide by 9 foot high Obermeyer-type maintenance gate is located between the Primary and Emergency Intakes.  The gate will allow river flows less than 2,500 cfs to be diverted away from the Intake Channel to facilitate maintenance work. 4.  Channel Modifications - Channel modifications will consist of grouted rock and riprap lining of an approximate 900 foot reach of the American River channel at the location of the intake structures and additional riprap protection of the cofferdam for another 900 feet upstream.  A 30-foot depth cutoff wall extends approximately 220 feet across the channel at the entrance to the intake area.  In addition to the grouted rock protection, channel modifications will include construction of a new channel cross section through plug areas located at the tunnel entrance and exit. 5.  Air and Water Piping - Air and water piping will extend from the pump station a distance of approximately 140 feet down the valley side to the Intake Vault structure.   Piping will include: a.  4- to 8-inch diameter ductile iron, steel and stainless steel lines for air backwash of the Primary Intakes;  2-inch diameter stainless steel pipe for inflation of the Obermeyer Maintenance Gate;  6-inch diameter ductile iron line for washdown at the intake:  1/2-inch diameter nylon tubing in 6-inch PVC carrier pipe for actuation of backwash system pneumatic butterfly valves; 1/4-inch diameter tubing contained in carrier pipes for level sensing and flushing of stilling wells; additional 6-inch PVC carrier pipes for future use.  All of the above located in an excavated rock trench between the Pump Station Vault and the Intake Vault backfilled with flowfill.  Trench conditions below the Intake Vault vary. b.  6 pneumatically actuated butter fly valves located in the Intake Vault controlled by 6 solenoid valves located in the Pump Station Vault and linked to a SCADA system. 6.  Intake Access - Access to the top surfaces of the intake structures and Obermeyer Gate for maintenance work will be provided by a drive-down access road.  Access to the interiors of the Emergency Intake and the Intake Vault will be provided through hatches up to 8 feet by 12 feet in size.   The largest hatches are intended to allow both a skidsteer and a large sediment bin to be lowered into the structure.  The bin could be used in combination with a skid-steer to remove accumulated sediment. 7.  GDPUD Pipeline - A 48-inch diameter concrete encased casing pipe is to be constructed across the river channel upstream of the Emergency Intake.  The casing pipe will provide for future construction of the proposed 30-inch diameter GDPUD steel pressure line currently stubbed out at the Pump Station east wall.   C.  Schedule B - Schedule B of Phase II of the American River Pump Station project consists of closure of the river diversion tunnel inlet and outlet; a diversion access road; and the Public Access Components of the project. The Public Access Components consist of a park entrance building, parking areas and turnarounds, improvements to access roads, and construction of a new trail. 1.  Closure of the River Diversion Tunnel - The inlet and outlet of the existing 33-foot diameter horseshoe shaped diversion tunnel will be closed. The inlet closure shall consist of sheet piles linked together and supported at the top and bottom to cover the tunnel opening.  The entrance will then be backfilled to cover the face of the sheet piles. The tunnel outlet shall be closed with rock fill. The rock fill shall be allowed to fall into its natural angle of repose inside the tunnel. The outside rock fill slope shall not exceed two horizontal to one vertical. Approximately 1,520 square feet of sheet pile and 8 cubic yards of concrete will be required for closure of the tunnel inlet. Approximately 9,000 cubic yards of rock fill will be required for closure of the tunnel outlet.  2.  Diversion Access Road - An access road shall be constructed from the existing pump station site to the intake structure in schedule A. The access road shall be concrete over an aggregate base and the work will include guardrail and drainage facilities. Total length of road to be constructed is approximately 552 feet. 3.  Park Entrance Building - A 10-foot by 22-foot, single story, block masonry building will be constructed just off Maidu Drive at the entrance to the park.  The building will have water and electrical service.  A precast concrete sanitary vault will be installed to provide sewer service for the building. 4.  Parking Areas and Turnarounds - A paved and striped parking area, consisting of approximately 15 spaces (1 ADA), will be constructed just off Maidu Drive.  The parking area will include a drinking fountain, trash containers, and a kiosk.  A second parking area, consisting of a paved and striped parking area consisting of approximately 50 spaces (2 ADA), will be constructed at the existing Auburn Dam Batch Plant site just above Oregon Bar.  The parking area will include bathrooms, trash containers, and a kiosk. Fencing shall be placed around the existing ponds in this area. Construction of the Maidu and Batch Plant parking areas will consist of minor grading for drainage purposes.  A third parking area will be constructed solely for ADA access near the river channel on a rock bench approximately 1,200 feet Northwest of the existing diversion tunnel outlet.  The gravel ADA parking area will be approximately 80 feet by 80 feet.  A gravel road approximately 520 feet long and 15 feet wide will be constructed from an existing road to the ADA parking area.  A turnaround area, to be used by the Department of Parks and Recreation and emergency vehicles, will be constructed next to the river channel approximately 100 feet Northeast and down grade from the ADA parking area.  The gravel turnaround will be approximately 30 feet by 50 feet.  The ADA parking area, ADA access road, and turnaround area will require rock and common soil excavation.  Another gravel turnaround will be constructed near Oregon Bar.  The turnaround will be approximately 50 feet by 50 feet.  Construction of this turnaround will consist mainly of grubbing existing shrubs and some minor grading. 5.  Improvements to Access Roads - Approximately 6,900 linear feet of 24-foot wide existing paved road between Maidu Drive and the Batch Plant parking area will be improved by overlaying the entire width of the existing paved area. Approximately 4,200 linear feet of 24-foot wide existing dirt road between the Batch Plant parking area and river turnaround will be improved.  The improvements will consist of grading to smooth the road and then installing a gravel base. Approximately 4,450 linear feet of 15-foot wide existing dirt road between the Batch Plant parking are and the Oregon Bar take-out area will be improved.  The improvements will consist of grading to smooth the road and then installing a gravel base.  Culverts will also be installed along the road to provide adequate drainage. 6.  Trail - A 4-foot wide trail, approximately 3,920 linear feet, will be constructed between the Batch Plant parking area and the Oregon Bar turnaround area.  The construction of the trail will consist of removal of boulders, grading and grubbing.  Also, drainage facilities such as culverts and bridges shall be constructed along the trail. The total length of trail to be constructed is approximately 3,920 feet.

<DESC>The purpose of this project will be to secure the services for hazardous fuels reduction and timber stand improvement on approximately 3579 acres of National Forest land on the Northern Hills Ranger District.  The objectives of the subsequest contract will be to reduce the potential of a wildfire reaching private homes adjacent to the National Forest and to provide strategic locations to help firefighters contain future wildfires.  This will be accomplished by reducing the total amount of surface fuel present and by breaking up the vertical and horizontal continuity of aerial fuels.  Also, stand characteristics will be improved by selectively thinning the understory to leave the largest, healthiest trees.

To achieve these objectives, this project will require mulching all ladder fuels, reducing the density of trees from seedlings two feet high up to trees with a 7 inch diameter at breast height (DBH), and mulching of all pre-existing and contractor created slash within the specified units. This will require contractor concern for stand visuals after treatment and the protection of private property during the treatment.  

The resultant contract will be awarded as a single firm-fixed priced, Performanced Based Service Contract, utilizing Request for Quote procedures.  

Numbered Note 1 Applies.

All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered for award.

The unit provides up to 360,000 British Thermal Units (30 tons) per hour total cooling utilizing an EPA approved non-ozone depleting refrigerant.  Once set, TMAC is required to operate automatically and provides either ventilating air or cool dehumidified air at adjustable temperatures down to 50 degrees Fahrenheit (F) in ambient temperatures between 40 and 120 degrees F.  Air can be discharged at volumes up to 200 pounds per minute with a static pressure of one pound per square inch gage (psig) through two eight inch diameter ducts.  TMAC shall be air transportable in C-130, C-17, and C-5 aircraft.  The RFP will be posted  on/or about 15 Feb 2005.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Weapons and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) (PMA263) is releasing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek proposals for research support in developing innovative solutions for the Maritime and Littoral Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission.  Concepts developed under this BAA may be considered in the development of future unmanned ISR systems and system improvements.  The Navy’s desire is to develop ISR mission system enhancements for implementation in the 2013 timeframe, concurrent with other planned ISR improvements.   The U.S. Navy is in the process of recapitalizing its land-based maritime ISR capabilities, currently provided by the aging P-3 and EP-3 aircraft.  The Navy believes that the integration of manned and unmanned systems enables the creation of an overarching maritime architecture that can effectively enhance ISR mission performance and result in improved cost and mission effectiveness.  The manned portion of the Navy’s Family of Systems (FoS) with Broad Area Maritime ISR capabilities that will replace the P-3 and EP-3 are the Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA/P-8A) and the Aerial Common Sensor (ACS) aircraft.  The unmanned portion is the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance System (BAMS), the VTUAV (Fire Scout), and the Tactical Control System (TCS).  The desired outcome of this study is a capability based definition and overarching systems architecture that will support the development of the unmanned portion of the FoS for maritime ISR.    
The complete Broad Agency Announcement and all associated documentation will be listed at http://www.navair.navy.mil  (choose “Doing Business” from the left side of the page; select “Open Solicitations”; select N00019-05-R-0071).  All associated documentation (Government Furnished Information, DD254, etc) will also be posted at the above website.  Submit any questions in writing to jessica.blackwell@navy.mil.  Questions and answers will be posted at the above web site.  All updates to the BAA will be posted to the above web site.  It is highly recommended that interested offerors continually check the web site.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of PMW 180 intends to issue a Request for Proposal for 300 modified Commercial-Off- Theâ€“Shelf (COTS), Universal Shipborne Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) in FY06, followed by an option for another 200 AIS in FY07.  This synopsis and resultant solicitation for commercial items will be in accordance with FAR Part 12.  An Indefinite Quantity, Firm Fixed Price contract is planned.  Quantities are planned for a minimum of 20 and maximum of 500.  SPAWAR plans to issue a solicitation within the next two weeks.  All interested offerors are requested to monitor the SPAWAR e-commerce site at http://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. Each AIS shall consist of, as a minimum, a class "A" transponder unit, minimum keyboard display (MKD), associated input/output junction, connection, or distribution boxes, internal GPS, and all associated cables. Delivery shall also include Warranty and supporting documentation for use of the equipment.   Additionally, the Navy is considering optimal antenna options, whether to diplex AIS with existing antenna capabilities or adding a "stand- alone" antenna.  For the purposes of this synopsis, plan on inclusion of a one- half (Â½) wavelength vertical VHF antenna (and all associated cables) as an itemized portion of the proposal, in the event it is included in the contract. Modifications for AIS in support of the upcoming solicitation will include receive- only and restricted modes of operation to support Navy missions.  The operator must be able to change to any mode within 60 seconds. The Government requests that all industry questions and comments be submitted to Kim Mallis at kim.mallis@navy.mil in Microsoft Word 2000 or compatible format.  Also attached to this announcement is the draft Statement of Work for the Automatic Identification System.

<CONTACT>Bill Wolfe 717-605-2191 Mark Kendall, ph 717-605-6474
<DESC>This synopsis describes the proposed 5-year base acquisition of the Phalanx Close-In-Weapon-System (CIWS) and Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS) system for which  NAVICP plans to establish and operate a full Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Program covering approximately 1,300 CIWS spare and repair items and 135 RAM GMLS spare and repair items.  No option periods apply The award of this proposed fixed price award fee requirements contract would replace the current PBL requirements contract, N00104-00-D-ZD21, with Raytheon Company, Missile Systems Division (RMS) for the CIWS only, with an expiration 28 Jun 2005.  A six-month option has been processed to act as a bridge and provide for continued, uninterrupted PBL coverage until the anticipated award of this current, follow-on solicitation in late Dec 2005.  Raytheon shall again function as the Government’s Commercial Stock Point for these spares including the performance of inventory management functions including, but not limited to, receiving, shipping, tracking, warehousing, reporting and scheduling.  Raytheon will be responsible for fleet requisition support to the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard (CG) and all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers with or without Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Agreements (CLSSA).   Under the proposed CIWS/RAM PBL requirements contract to be awarded, RMS will be obligated to perform to metrics such as the following metrics or similar metrics.  RMS will be required to sustain and maintain the established, current Supply Material Availability (SMA) goal of 92% and comply with various established requisition response time standards for  RMS’ deliveries by either its own contract carrier (FOB-Dest) for CONUS or the government’s Smart Transportation System (STS) for OCONUS.  CASREP/Issue Priority Group I requisitions shall be delivered to CONUS addresses at a standard of 67 hours and to OCONUS ports of entry at a 24 hour standard while simultaneously reducing overall support costs.  Median backorder age reduction is a third metric and the current standard of 60 days shall be reduced by 10% per year for the 5-year period.  These metrics in addition to small business management initiatives are weighted as award fee evaluation factors for performance above the ! standards and incentivization from an award fee pool.  The fixed price portion shall be decremented for sub-standard performance. NAVICP-M is currently processing a corporate solicitation with Raytheon Corporation with a scheduled award in November 2005 that provides the standard terms, provisions and conditions for the establishment and operation of a corporate PBL program under an eight year term requirements contract for various sole source, Raytheon-manufactured weapon systems, including the CIWS and RAM.  Synopsis of the corporate PBL solicitation occurred 10 March 2004 via Navy Electronic Commerce Online and specifically cited these systems.  Each system, including the CIWS, is also separately clinned in the corporate solicitation.   The corporate PBL contract’s goal is a flexible, streamlined PBL process between the Navy and Raytheon that would leverage heavily on standardization of terms and conditions for all systems to reduce administrative lead-time (ALT) /cycle time, process variation(s) and cost.  Following award of the corporate PBL, the CIWS and RAM will be awarded via contract modificat! ion or delivery order to/under the corporate PBL citing the unique, essential requirements applicable to both weapon systems.  Alternatively, the proposed CIWS/RAM PBL may be awarded as a stand-alone contract.  CIWS and RAM pricing will be on a fixed price basis as noted.   RMS’ final proposal for both weapons systems must demonstrate a savings compared to Navy support costs as determined by an independent cost benefit analysis.

<DESC>The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement to continue specialized scientific and technical support to the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) and the Sounder Research Team (SRT) in the Laboratory for Atmospheres.  This support includes, but is not limited to, the following:  1) the development of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) atmospheric model and an integrated land surface model to simulate the atmospheric general circulation, provide a component of the atmospheric analysis system to assimilate Earth Observing System (EOS) data, and transport of chemical constituents in the troposphere, and stratosphere; 2) the development and testing of atmospheric data assimilation systems that advance the usefulness of satellite data and contribute to observing system development; 3) the development of assimilation procedures to use satellite-based rainfall data to improve GMAO models and analyses; 4) the generation of products in support of NASA instrument teams and climate research; 5) the generation and analysis of products from the Advanced Television Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder and retrievals from the Advanced Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on EOS/Aqua; and 6) the development of systems for generation of surface wind analyses, and observing system impact studies.   NASA GSFC intends to increase the maximum ordering value by $4.5M under Contract NAS5-00167 to allow for the extension of task order requirements for up to 3 additional months beginning December 1, 2005.  At this time, it is anticipated that GMAO task order requirements will only be extended through December 31, 2005, and SRT task order requirements will only be extended through January 31, 2006.  The maximum ordering value increase and task order extensions are required to ensure uninterrupted support and to meet critical requirements until two follow-on competitive contracts are awarded.  While the competitive follow-on procurements are being conducted, Sciences Applications International Corporation (SAIC) must continue supporting the following critical requirements:  participation in real-time forecasting during the hurricane season using GEOS-5; completion and full validation of GEOS-5; provision of meteorology and atmospheric constituent products in support of Aura validation campaigns; continued real-time and near-real time meteorology products in support of Aura instrument team retrievals and MODIS land products; and supporting commitments to NOAA/National Centers for Environmental Prediction through the NOAA/NASA/DoD Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation in the continued development of the atmospheric data assimilation system and the advance of AIRS and MODIS satellite data assimilation. This procurement action is being conducted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source.  SAIC possesses the unique and specialized experience necessary to support the critical requirements until the follow-on contracts are awarded. SAIC is the only company with the capability to provide the technical support without a reduction in service.  Any other contractor would be required to (1) train people in the operational procedures established for the generation of these specialized products; (2) learn the GMAO atmospheric and land surface models and atmospheric analysis systems (containing hundreds of thousands lines of code) to a sufficient technical level to be able to make modifications to the code as a result of tuning and/or validation runs; and (3) hire an adequate number of staff from the limited pool of specialized scientists who have experience in the development and evaluation of models and assimilation systems and in the use of satellite data streams to meet all the critical requirements identified above. In addition, it is not practical or cost effective to conduct a full and open competition for up to 3 months of support as a precursor to the award of the 2 follow-on contracts.  To compete a contract for only 3 months introduces risks to the completion of critical requirements to support GMAO and SRT.  The phase-in time and lead-time for new contractor personnel to become minimally experienced and functional to meet the government requirements will result in unacceptable delays to the milestone schedules. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 22, 2005.  Interested organizations must provide documentation which establishes its capability in the required areas including documentation of past relevant experience.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>USDA-Forest Service, North Central Research Station (NCRS) seeks an engineering and architectural feasibility study for the NCRS headquarters building located on the University of Minnesota St. Paul campus. North Central Research Station is scheduled to repair or replace two major failing components of the headquarters facility in the near future: 1. Perimeter windowed curtain wall system, and 2. Perimeter steam heating system. 

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Firms/Lead Investigators interested in contracting for this work.  The A-E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project implementation.  The Lead Investigator is the individual or the team who will have primary responsibility to develop, conduct, and report the feasibility study.  

PERIMETER WINDOWED CURTAIN WALL SYSTEM.  

The headquarters building of the NCRS was constructed in the early 1960’s.  The building is approximately 50,000 square feet in size and consists of two towers, (north tower and south).  The north tower is made up of five stories.  An elevator penthouse sits atop the roof.  The south tower is built into the side of a hill and is made up of three stories.  The air handler penthouse sits atop the south tower.  The building is a reinforced concrete column, beam, and structural floor panel system with concrete spandrels along the perimeter.

The building exterior envelope consists of horizontal strip windows between each floor, a vertical curtain wall system composed of insulated metal panels and brick panels, and aluminum fins parallel to each window jamb running from grade to the roof.  The window system visually appears to be a curtain wall system, but in fact the curtain wall framing does not provide any structural support of the windows.  The curtain wall only provides a visual “ribbed” appearance to the building.

All indications are that the building exterior started leaking within the first year of occupancy.  Various attempts to mitigate the leaks have been attempted over the years including: caulking between the curtain wall panels, caulking the seams of the architectural “fins”, caulking between the fins and the panels, and installing new weather stripping in the windows.  None of these attempts to mitigate the leaks has had any prolonged effect.  Leaks occur on all sides of the building, usually after a significant rainstorm accompanied by winds strong enough to drive the rain in a horizontal direction.  The water usually saturates the area over and along the sides of the exterior windows resulting in loose plaster and water puddles on the floor.

PERIMETER STEAM HEATING SYSTEM.  

The pneumatically controlled perimeter heating system is powered by steam purchased from the University of Minnesota centralized steam plant.  The steam enters the building underground, into the second floor mechanical room.  The steam is reduced through a 50 lb steam manifold and then through a 10 lb manifold.  The 10 lb manifold distributes steam into 23 perimeter heating zones and up to the air handler penthouse.  Pneumatic air operates a thermostatically controlled steam valve for each steam zone.  Thermostatic traps are located at each terminal unit; terminal units being mostly radiators along with a few unit heaters.  Elsewhere throughout the building, float and thermostatic traps are mostly used on condensate drip legs.

The perimeter heating system requires a lot of time and expense to maintain.  Besides the fact that steam traps have to be checked each year and occasionally fail, we are finding that the condensate lines are also failing.  The condensate return piping (after the steam traps on terminal units) is in various stages of either plugging up or the walls are getting so thin that they rupture and leak.

BUILDING USE.  

Originally, the building had a dual use.  The north tower and the hallways connecting the towers have always been used as administrative space.  The south tower contained a number of wet chemistry laboratories and associated office space for scientists and technicians.  Over the years, the building has undergone a number of renovations.  There is only one true wet chemistry laboratory with a fume hood left.  All the other spaces have been converted to office space or some sort of utility space.  All but the one fume hood has been removed.

We are currently in the midst of consolidating employees to national facilities; meaning that not all of the existing space will be utilized.  This was not for-seen when project funding was approved.

BUILDING HISTORY.        

A cooling tower was originally used for ventilation cooling.  In the mid-1980’s the cooling tower was replaced with two York, 50-ton, rooftop chillers.  The University of Minnesota is in the process of constructing a centralized chilled water plant.  A study was commissioned in 2003 to determine the cost effectiveness of connecting to the new chilled water system vs. replacing the rooftop chillers.  Cost-wise, it is literally a wash.  However, not having the equipment to be concerned with nor having to keep staff around to maintain that equipment pushes the decision towards connecting to the centralized chilled water plant.  The rooftop chillers would then be eliminated.

In the early 1990’s, a direct digital control energy management system was installed in the building.  The energy management system was used to control the building ventilation.  Most of the control actuators remain pneumatic.

The original air handling units were constant volume units with steam pre-heat coils and steam re-heat coils.  Temperature controls were pneumatic.  Air handling unit #1 supplies six ventilation zones in the north tower and air handling unit #2 supplies eight ventilation zones to the connecting corridors and the south tower.  The towers and corridor return air to their respective air handling units.  In 2001, the air handling units were replaced with modular Trane units.  A steam to hot water converter was installed in the penthouse to serve ventilation pre-heat and re-heat coils.  The temperature controls were converted to a complete electronic system controlled by the building energy management system.

SERVICES.  

The steady deterioration of the condensate lines in the heating system along with the continual moisture problems due to the curtain wall system has prompted the Forest Service to determine what course of action(s) might be taken in order to deal with these problems.  The services requested in this feasibility study is to investigate, evaluate, and report the deficiencies in the curtain wall system and the perimeter steam heating system and propose alternatives to solve or deal with these deficiencies.
 
SELECTION PROCESS.  

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Firms/Lead Investigators interested in contracting for this work.  The A-E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project implementation.  The Lead Investigator is the individual or the team who will have primary responsibility to develop, conduct, and report the feasibility study.

The A-E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: 

Stage I:	Interested firms will submit a completed Standard Form 330 Architect-Engineer Qualification to establish a short-list (minimum of three A-E Firms) of firms with the qualifications to accomplish this project.

Stage II:	Qualified A-E Firms will submit proposals to accomplish the feasibility study.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services to prepare a Cooperative Prostate Cancer Tissue Resource (CPCTR) Tissue Microarray Image Repository with The University of Illinois at Chicago, Department of Pathology 1819 Polk Street, Chicago, IL. 60612. 

The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 611310 and the business size standard is $6M.  

The Cancer Diagnosis Program is charged with facilitating research using human specimens and patient data to advance development of cancer diagnostics.  One way to accomplish this is to create sets of reference tissues that can be used by researchers to evaluate specific cancer biomarkers.  One specific approach that makes parsimonious use of valuable tumor specimens is the creation of tissue microarrays (TMAs).   TMAs permit cancer researchers to efficiently test candidate diagnostic reagents against hundreds of tumors at one time.  The pathological, clinical and specimen data describing each of the cores of the TMA block are prepared as a single data file that is distributed to researchers along with the prepared histologic sections of the TMA blocks.  Researchers use data from the original tumor samples to interpret the results of their marker assays.  This project is to provide a web-accessible repository for whole-slide scanned images of the original histopathologic specimens from which the TMA cores were sampled, along with the complex, composite images of the TMA slides. In addition, the contractor shall provide an annotation system that will link specimen images to clinical and pathologic specimen data stored in the TMA database.   The University of Illinois is one of the four (4) cooperative agreements that is part of the Cooperative Prostate Cancer Tissue Resource (CPCTR).  The scope of the Cooperative Agreement does not include image archiving.   The services to be performed by the University of Illinois will permit NCI to specify the needs to construct and distribute image-annotated TMAs.  The four (4) sites under this cooperative agreement have decided that the University of Illinois should be the primary site as they have the requisite imaging equipment already in place.  The four cooperative agreements have contributed the blocks and data for construction of the TMA’s and they control the use.  Other specimens with associated data cannot be substituted since the TMAs have already been statistically designed and constructed.  Period of performance: September 15, 2005 – September 14, 2006 with two optional years.  The University of Illinois is the only source known that can provide the equipment and establishment to fulfill the services required.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT on August 17, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call 301-402-4509 or email Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at the above email address to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 514210   NAICS:518210 The US EPA is conducting market research for the requirements described herein. This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This is not a formal solicitation or a request for proposals. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The proposed requirement mentioned herein is being considered for small businesses. The Government will use responses to this sources sought notice to make appropriate acquisition decisions. The NAICS for this requirement is 518210, with a small business  size standard of $21.0 million. The Information Services and Support Branch (ISSB; Environmental Information, Office of Information Collection, Information Exchange and Services Division, Information Services and Support Branch) is seeking to determine if any commercial businesses are able to host  geo-spatial datasets purchased or created by the USEPA. EPA is concerned with the collection, assimilation and analysis of spatial from multiple sources. The agency has purchased and acquired thousands of geospatial datasets (e.g. GDT highway data, schools data, etc. approximately 50GB) at the same  time EPA Program Offices and Regional Offices have made significant progress creating geospatial information resources that are critical for the Agency's mission. Today, vast amounts of geospatial resources exist but are not easily available for EPA's GIS community. A complete copy of this RFI can  be found at http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adp_placement/geospat/index.htm

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Radiation and Indoor Environments (R&IE) National Laboratory, Center for Radioanalysis and Quality Assurance (CRQA) in Las Vegas, NV intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Canberra Industries, Inc. of Meriden, CT. The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain a Model LB5500 Series 5 Large Area Automatic Low Background Alpha/Beta Counting System and integrated Eclipse analysis package to extend the  capabilities of the existing 50-sample, two-inch system.  It has been determined that Canberra Industries, Inc. is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement given software and hardware compatibility and system interchangeability and backup considerations. Any deviation from this  requirement would require additional spectroscopy analysis hardware and software, development of custom in-house programming, reconfiguration of existing systems into split systems running different analysis software, and extensive training. In addition, market research has indicated there is no  other known manufacturer that produces similar software and data archiving formats meeting these requirements that satisfy compatibility requirements with the current counting system. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334519. NO SOLICITATION OR  REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received by the closing date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A  determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via e-mail at rodgers.jami@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement to procure a thermo-optical carbon analyzer with the following specifications.  The analyzer must have (1) a minimum detectable limit of less than 0.5 ug/m3 (often essential for ambient measurements), (2) the ability to measure organic and elemental carbon with a time resolution at or less than 45 min duty cycle, and (3) the absence of interferences from absorbing gas phase constituents through the use of a carbon-strip denuder.  This action is being pursued on a sole source basis because it is  believed that no other semicontinuous carbon analyzers are available on the market with a sufficient time resolution (criterion 2) and precision (criterion 1) other than the analyzer provided by Sunset Laboratories.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and  therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  The NAICS Code 334516 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be  ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement  Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Core Electronics and Antenna Upgrade to Diego Garcia Remote Tracking Station, Side B
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-05-75
<RESPDATE>082305
<ARCHDATE>09072005
<CONTACT>Allison Flanagan, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 363-1104, Email allison.flanagan@losangeles.af.mil - Captain Michael Carlson, Contract Negotiator, Phone (310) 363-6342, Email michael.carlson@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>This effort involves upgrading the core electronics and antenna facilities at the Diego Garcia Remote Tracking Station B-side (DGS-B).  DGS-B, located on the island of Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory, is one of eight Remote Tracking Stations (RTS) that, together with two control centers, comprise the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN).  The AFSCN is DoD’s primary network for launch and early orbit operations.  The AFSCN provides telemetry, tracking, and commanding capability, mission data dissemination and processing, and is the world’s only high-powered network for emergency recovery.

The island currently consists of an A-side Automatic Remote Tracking Station (ARTS).  DGS-B is the fifth article of the RTS Block Change (RBC) upgrade/modernization effort.  The RBC upgrades to the AFSCN are the next step in the evolution towards the Integrated Satellite Control Network (ISCN).  

DGS-B is the only tracking station located in the southern hemisphere.  Eastern hemisphere loading is expected to peek in 2006.  The RBC upgrade at Diego Garcia is key to ensuring uninterrupted operational capability to our AFSCN users.  Due to mission need, and funding requirements, any interested contractor must begin work in FY 06 and deliver the final product NLT 30 September 2008.  The upgrade at DGS-B will include, but may not be limited to, the following deliverables:

	Procurement of upgraded Configuration Item (CI) hardware/software; Site-specific installation design and antenna facility construction; Modified design/installation drawings and/or documentation; Assembly, integration, and testing of the core CI at the integration and test support facility; Installation and test of hardware/software at the RTS; Assembly and checkout of Antenna CI at vendor; Installation and test of Antenna at the RTS; High Power Amplifier (HPA) hardware/software acquisition; Installation and testing of the HPA at the I&TSF; Installation and test of HPA at the RTS; Support Government conducted Boresight and Pre-IST tests; Dehumidification/Desalinization Environmental Control Enhancement Unit; Anemometer Blower Latching Option; DGS-B GPS SAASM; Site selection

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine the extent of whether potential offers exist who are capable of achieving the program objectives within acceptable cost, performance and schedule parameters.  Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. (HTSI) was awarded the Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC) in December 2001, and is presently on contract to deliver the first four RBC articles.  Due to requirements and schedule changes, the ordering period to exercise DGS-B has elapsed.  The Government anticipates a sole source award to the incumbent contractor, Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc., but all responsible sources may submit a SOC that will be considered by the agency.  The Government does not anticipate any set-asides for this action.

Responsible sources interested in this notice may submit their SOC, with documented evidence of their capability to meet all technical, performance and schedule requirements, no later than 23 Aug 05 to:  SMC/RNK, Attn:  Allison Flanagan, Contracting Officer or Capt Mike Carlson, Contract Manager, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467, Los Angeles AFB, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659.

All responses are to be unclassified and should not exceed fifty (50) one-sided pages.  The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.  Small business offers note that small business size standard NAICS 541710 (1,000 employees) applies.

All submitted SOCs will be evaluated to establish a pool of sources capable of supporting this requirement.  The Government will then determine competition type based on availability of responsible, qualified sources.  This determination is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The selection of one or more sources for determination of competition type will be based on an evaluation of each offerors SOC to determine the overall merit of capability.  The SOCs will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance:  1) Lack of substantial duplication of costs on the RBC effort.  2) Ability to maintain schedule requirements and meet delivery date of 30 September 2008.  3) Capability of performance parameters.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Engineer Prosper Tesha, Director General, Tanzania Airports Authority, Dar es Salaam International Airport, Terminal 1, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Phone: +255-22-2842402-3, Fax: +255-22-2844495.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Tanzania Airports Authority ICT Infrastructure Project.

The Tanzania Airports Authority (TAA) is a semi-autonomous entity that owns and manages 62 airports and airstrips.  The stated vision of the TAA is to become a model in the provision of airport facilities and services in Eastern Africa by 2010; the TAA deems the development of its Common-Use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) capability to be critical to the success of the vision.  To that end, in 2002 the TAA management developed an ICT Strategic Framework to plan, acquire, and implement the ICT infrastructure required.  The Framework provided a basis to begin ICT development at the airport and to budget for its expansion, however the TAA recognizes the importance of developing a full strategic plan to avoid repetition and acquisition mistakes, and to guarantee the proper integration and efficient implementation of current and future expansion.  

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)-funded study will provide the TAA with an information technology strategy for improved airport security, business processes, and infrastructure development for Dar es Salaam International Airport and the airport system at large under the TAA's authority.  The study would also provide specific guidance for the implementation of the recommended strategy and develop specifications for three priority systems for TAA procurement.  

A summary of the Terms of Reference (TOR) for this project is as follows:

Task 1.  A Review of Current ICT Environment 
Task 2.  A Review of TAA Business Processes  
Task 3.  Development of an Information and Communications Technology Strategy   
Task 4.  Functional and Technical Specifications for a Digital Communications System  
Task 5.  Functional and Technical Specifications for a Dar es Salaam International Airport Integrated Security System
Task 6.  Functional and Technical Directives for Information Management Systems
Task 7.  An ICT Security Plan 
Task 8.  Recommendations for Implementation
Task 9.  Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $371,750 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, September 20, 2005, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the Pride Youth Programs Newago, MI.
Purpose:

PRIDE (Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education) has an international reputation for excellence and reliability as a provider of prevention services in the area of alcohol and other drugs.  Founded in 1977, PRIDE began as a parent organization and went on to expand its base to serve youth. The organization has evolved into what is now known as PRIDE Youth Programs. The underlying approach to this drug and violence prevention program for high school youth is the concept of youth as resources. America's PRIDE youth team members reach out to their peers and community with an assertive, drug-free message.  A network of PRIDE Parent Action Teams provides support to local PRIDE youth teams and others in their communities. The PRIDE Youth Programs network includes more than 100,000 community volunteers engaged in preventing drug use.

Each year, PRIDE Youth Programs welcomes its members and affiliates to the PRIDE World Conference for youth and adults. As the largest youth conference in the world, the PRIDE World Conference provides a forum and ideas for hundreds of organizations that fight against drugs. Participants hear more than 100 experts on over 20 topics related to drug and violence prevention and they listen to and learn from the experiences of their peers.

SAMHSA/CSAP sees the April 2006 PRIDE World Conference as an exceptional opportunity to reach a youth and parent audience with valuable educational tools and strategies both to build youth resiliency against alcohol and other drug use, and to increase their combined capacity to carry a drug-free message to their communities.
The PRIDE organization is highly respected among professionals and volunteers involved in the substance abuse prevention field.  PRIDE has earned its reputation over the past 25 years for having its finger squarely on the pulse of youth drug issues and solutions.   More than 6,400 school systems rely on PRIDE Questionnaires to monitor student drug use and violence and another 1 million youth have been reached by PRIDE Youth Training Programs. PRIDE’s Annual World Conference is the largest of its kind in the world.  The level of experience and expertise the PRIDE organization brings to the table for this conference is unequalled.  For SAMHSA/CSAP, the opportunity presents itself both to reach this vast audience of youth and parents, and to use information from the conference to guide policy and programming decisions to best serve this group.

PRIDE’s staff is extremely knowledgeable and experienced in both substance abuse prevention and youth development.  Their guidance and direction in developing customized workshop tracks for SMHSA/CSAP will greatly increase the overall learning experience and connect the workshop content to the educational design of the conference.  This will provide a seamless approach for training and will strengthen the connection to the Strategic Prevention Framework.   



THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>LITIGATION CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT
Purpose
This is a pre-solicitation announcement for an upcoming Department of Justice (DOJ) solicitation to acquire a Litigation Case Management System (LCMS).  The DOJ LCMS will support common litigation case management business needs in the 94 U.S. Attorneys Offices and the six other major DOJ litigating divisions and facilitate cross division litigation information sharing.  DOJ is looking for companies with proven past performance in implementing very large-scale case management systems of similar size (15,000 users), scope (government, Justice, legal related), and complexity (multiple, geographically-dispersed organizations).

Background

As part of market research, DOJ released an RFI on April 1, 2005 (under solicitation number DJJU-05-RFP-0332) to obtain information on the case management marketplace, operation and use of case management tools, and implications for the DOJ LCMS program.  Fifty-five responses were received, containing over 1,200 pages of information.  DOJ appreciates this overwhelming response and interest in the LCMS program.  In addition, DOJ surveyed over 77 government-wide acquisition contracts (GWACs) and multiple agency contracts (MACs) searching for the optimal vehicle that provided a high degree of competition as well as the necessary scope, ceiling, and period of performance to meet program needs.

Discussion

DOJ has decided to utilize the CIO-SP2i contract operated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) based on the criteria listed above.  Information about this contract, including prime contractor points of contact is located at: http://nitaac.nih.gov/ciosp2.asp.  DOJ intends to award a single, performance-based task order with incentives and options on this contract.  All further announcements and communications will be with CIO-SP2i prime contractors.

The time frame for the LCMS acquisition is as follows (Subject to change):
Â·	Mid August 2005 â€“ Release draft Task Order Requirements Package (TORP) for industry review and comment
Â·	Mid September 2005 â€“ Industry comments due
Â·	Mid October 2005 â€“ Release final RFP
Â·	Late October 2005 â€“ Offeror due diligence
Â·	Late November 2005 â€“ Proposals due
Â·	Early December 2005 â€“ Product demonstrations using DOJ scripted scenarios 
Â·	December 2005 through January 2006 â€“ Proposal evaluation
Â·	Mid March 2006 â€“ Final selection and task order award
It is DOJâ€™s intent to provide as much information as possible to enable offerors to prepare and submit quality, knowledge-based proposals.  
Original Point of Contact
David T. Collins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 307-1959, Fax (202) 307-1933, Email david.t.collins@usdoj.gov.  The best way to reach the POC is via email, not via phone.  From this point forward all LCMS inquiries should be made through the POC cited herein, not the LCMS Project Office .

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Medical Oncology Clinical Research Unit (MOCRU)), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Meso Scale Discovery, 9238 Gaither Road, Gaithersburg, MD 20877 for a  Sector Imager 2400. The Medical Oncology Clinical Research Unit has been working on a project to determine the effect of investigative drugs on the intended molecular targets and their biological effects on the target cancer cells and is to discover potential biomarkers and surrogate marker in correlative studies during clinical trials. This requires the analysis of biological samples obtained from treated patients, often as tumor core biopsies with a very limited number of cells.  The samples are extremely limiting, therefore, the technology requirements for analyzing the samples are very high:  robust, reliable and extremely sensitive.  It is also required that specific assays for plasma or urine biomarkers be rapidly developed and evaluated.  The assays need to be highly sensitive, quantitative, and reliable.  The electrochemluminescence (ECL) technology of the Sector Imager 2400 has a number of features that make it uniquely suitable for the clinical investigations as follows: capability to detect as little as 100,000 molecules of analytes and 25 attomoles of tag, capability to detect both total and phosphor-EGFR in as little as 30 ng cell lysates (160 cells worth) of A431 cells, capability to detect phosphor-ERK in 80 ng of stimulated Jurkat cell lysates where the signal to baseline ratio is about 600% with a CV of 5%, a signal dynamic range of about 4 logs,  capability to analyze up to 100 clinical specimens a day with quantitation and CVs in a discovery research environment, has multiplexing capability to examine multiple markers simultaneously in the same test wells. In the case of EGFR, both total and phosphor EGFR can be examined in the same wells in a 96-well plate.  The Meso Scale Diagnostic Sector Imager 2400 specializes in the developing of assays against biological markers. Due to this availability of validated assays and the ability to develop new assays there is no other source known to the NCI researcher for this product. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are not authorized. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on August 18, 2005.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist on gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. It is the contractor’s responsibility to call 301-402-4509 to verify questions have been received.

<DESC>SERVICES SOURCES SOUGHT: The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA and the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) intends to procure for the following services. Scope of Work:  Establish Baseline Healthy Coral Microbial Communities (FGBNMS) among Montastraea faveolata colonies and compare them with the same species in areas where corals suffer from greater health impacts (Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary). 1) Collect samples in the field: 5-10 ml needleless syringe samples of the surface mucopolysaccharide layer (SML of up to 100M. faveolata at the FGBNMS. Analyze samples for microbial community. 2) Collect water samples at the FGBNMS for microbial composition analysis. 3) Utilize primary screening methods for the production of anti-infective molecules by marine symbionts in order to determine levels of resiliency M. faveolata due to associated microbes. This primary screen would include a panel of known marine invertebrate pathogens. The government intends to solicit and negotitate with only one known source under the authority 41 USC 253(c) (1). The Mote Marine Laboratory offers expertise to conduct studies within the FGBNMS, to determine the baseline healthy coral microbial communities of certain coral species. Dr Kim Ritchie of the Mote Marine Laboratory is the only expert in this specific field of coral reef science. She has worked on coral microbial associates and aspects of coral healthy for the past 15 years. She received a PhD in genetics and applies this background to her work on corals and genetic identification of bacteria. She has identified, via culture methods, bacterial symbionts of healthy corals and has identified and characterized the causative agents of White Pox disease of Acropora palmate; Aspergillosis of sea fans; White Plague Type II; a localized disease of the burrowing urchin, Meoma ventricosa, and recently a putative causative agent of White Band Disease in Acroporid corals. Dr Ritchie held the position of Senior Scientist at Microgenomics, Inc., where she applied her work on coral microbial associates to antibiotic production from these isolates, which she now applies to coral reef ecology through the Mote Marine Laboratory.

<DESC>I.	INTRODUCTION
Battelle Energy Alliance LLC, Management and Operating Contractor of the Idaho Nationl Laboratory is requesting an EOI from prospective vendors to provide an engineering team to include a designated team leader to execute a Design Basis Reconstitution Program for the Advanced Test Reactor.  The team will support the ATR Safety and Design Basis Engineering staff in preparing Design Basis Documents for the safety related systems.  The team will be responsible to identify and evaluate design recovery actions and validate safety system functionality.  This work is to be completed by October 1, 2007.

II.	BACKGROUND  
The ATR is a Department of Energy (DOE) owned nuclear test reactor located at the Reactor Technology Complex (RTC) of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) approximately 50 miles west of Idaho Falls, Idaho.  The ATR is a pressurized-water design with a design thermal power of 250 MW.  The ATR was designed in the late 1950s. Construction began in November 1961.  Nuclear criticality was achieved in July 1967.  Full power was achieved in August 1969.

The ATR Design Basis Reconstitution Program is similar to design basis reconstitution programs that have been executed in commercial nuclear power plants.  The ATR is similar in design, design basis issues and design and safety documentation status to commercial nuclear power plants of similar vintage at the start of their design basis reconstitution programs.

III.	SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENT

1.	A summary of corporate and individual experience in execution of design basis reconstitution projects in older commercial nuclear power plants of a vintage similar to ATR.
2.	Resumes of key personnel who would be assigned to the project.
3.	Examples of design basis reconstitution project procedures, processes, and/or work performed in similar facilities.

Please provide your written expression of interest by Close-of Business, August 17, 2005 to Steve Gihring, Battelle Energy Alliance, P.O. Box 1625, Mail Stop 6132, Idaho Falls, ID 83415

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Government is looking for a 'sensor system', meaning a set of distributed day/night cameras mounted on the  vehicle that are connected to a display/control module. The display will be used by the Squad Leader, and must be located inside the back of the vehicle.  Mounting of the sensors on the top of the vehicles is not desired.  Key performance parameters of in terest include:  (1) The threshold capability for the situational awareness system shall allow the squad leader to view 270 degrees horizontally around the sides and rear of the vehicle and 45 degrees vertically in both day and night conditions.  The objective capability w ill allow for 360 degree horizontally around the vehicle and 60 degrees vertically in day and night conditions.  (2) The threshold capability of the system shall have the ability to detect/recognize a person in motion at 300 meters in both day and night conditions under clear and degraded visibility conditions (smoke, fog, haze, rain, dust, etc).  The objective capab ility of the system shall have the ability to detect/recognize a person in motion at 500 meters in both day and night conditions under clear and degraded visibility conditions (smoke, fog, haze, rain, dust, etc).   Other key parameters include: (1) Squad Leaders ability to view the total surroundings outside the vehicle with ease and simple control (2) Sensors do not require in field focusing.   Interested sources are requested to provide a brief description of products previously or currently being developed, which meet the requirements specified herein.

Demonstration equipment may have to undergo a safety in spection and release before the demonstration.  Any communication beyond the written responses to this market survey and demonstrations are tentatively scheduled to take place in the September 2005 timeframe.  In no event will information obtained in respo nse to this announcement be utilized for any subsequent competition.  Written, verbal or product demonstrations are solely for the purpose of market analysis and arent to be construed as an actual request for proposal, quote or bid.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to support program development, implementation and achievement of USAID/Jamaica’s Economic Growth Strategic Objective (SO) of Increased Trade Competitiveness in Targeted Industries (SO 9).  To achieve the Economic Growth Strategic Objective, two Intermediate Results (IRs) have been identified, specifically IR 1: Competitive Clusters Developed and IR 2: Business Environment Improved.  These two results will be accomplished through the design and implementation of activities that will stimulate economic growth, maximize Jamaica’s benefits from bilateral, regional and international trade agreements and position target industries and firms to take maximum advantage of opportunities created as a result of these agreements and other sustainable development opportunities.  USAID/Jamaica-Caribbean seeks to procure the services of a qualified firm or an effective consortium of firms to focus efforts on reducing and eliminating impediments to economic growth, competitiveness and investment and on developing competitive industry clusters and firms that have the capacity to compete in an increasingly more competitive global economy.
  
Program implementation is expected to be carried out through the provision of short-term and long-term technical assistance, training, local capacity building, private sector partnership development, public-private alliance creation, grants under contract, public information campaigns/outreach, limited commodity procurement, and other related services.  The related economic growth strategy is a component of the broader USAID/Jamaica FY2005-FY2009 sustainable development strategy to be a catalyst for Transformational Change to Accelerate Sustainable and Equitable Economic Growth in a More Competitive World.  The program will engage a collaborative approach to economic development by mobilizing public and quasi-public institutions, the private sector, supporting non-governmental organizations (NGOs), other donors, the Jamaican Diaspora and targeted urban and rural communities throughout Jamaica to support demand driven activities that contribute to sustainable and equitable economic growth, the elimination of barriers to competitive global trade and investment, increased competitiveness of the private sector, improved quality of the labor force, and the capacity to take greatest advantage of opportunities created by the Caribbean Single Market & Economy (CSME), the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), the World Trade Organization (WTO), other Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and by hosting key Cricket World Cup 2007 events.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: Question 1: What will be the approximate level of effort?   Answer: Approximately 12-20 personnel Question 2:  What will the security clearance requirements be?   Answer: Many personnel will require secret security clearances. Question 3: What is meant by several of the terms on the sources sought  synopsis? Answers: Presentation preparation involves preparing charts, electronically.  Editing  them, reformatting them, and saving them on CDs and electronically.  Hard  copies will also be required - printed from the electronic charts.  There may  be graphs, pie charts, bar charts, etc that need to be prepared.     	As far as the System Interfacing, the government requires interfacing  with mostly government systems.     	For networking, the government requires the admin to be able to access  government systems using the government established computer websites.     	Program Management for the government means that we need a "Program  Manager" that must have experience with the management of contractor personnel.  The "Program Manager" would only supervise contractor, on-site personnel. The  program manager will act as a primary contact point between the government and  the contracting company and be available, either in person, or by phone, to  discuss any matters with a reasonable advanced notification.  In cases where  the "Program Manager" is not available an alternate person must be assigned and  the government notified.  Question 4:  How do you prefer to receive a capabilities packages? Answer:  Capabilities packages may be sent electronically or via hard copy  although both methods simultaneously is preferable. It is important to note that this synopsis is very brief purposely and will  eventually be followed by a detailed government solicitation.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide responses to questions received. All other terms and conditions remains unchanged. 

1. Common Criteria is currently version 2.1 and the draft of version 3 is released and due for acceptance July 2006.   Does the Government mean the 128K dual interface smart card is to be certified to Common Criteria, version 2.1?

Answer: This question does not refer to Common Criteria, but to Global Platform.  For more information on Global Platform, visit www.globalplatform.org.

2. Within the Request for Information (RFI), Question number one "How soon could a 128K dual interface Smart Card that complies with technical requirements of FIPS-201 and SP 800-73 be developed, tested, manufactured and made available to government acquisition officers?", does the term "dual interface" refer to 'contact' and 'contactless'? If so, are you expecting responses to address and satisfy any specific interface specification(s)?

Answer:  Yes, and yes.

3. Is this a new requirement, or is there a current contract in place for the services?  

Answer: First, this is not a requirement; it is a Request for Information to determine the current state of industry and its readiness to meet a perceived emerging government requirement.  There is a current contract in place for smart cards.  It allows for technology refresh.  Therefore, if the responses to the RFI indicate the availability of products that meet the Government’s needs a formal process for determining suitability and further decisions on migrating to the larger capacity cards will be made.

4. If there is a current contract, please provide the following information; contractor address, contract number, contract type, award and expiration date, and value.  

Answer: It is the Smart Access ID Card GWAC.  Any other information can be obtained through the Freedom of Information Act process (FOIA).

<DESC>The requirement is determined sole source because Philips Medical Inc. is the only known vendor that provides original equipment manufacturer (OEM)/factory trained technicians with up to date/current OEM certifications and is the only known supplier of OEM replacement parts.  A near 0% down time is required of all equipment covered by this requirement.  From a liability standpoint, the subject equipment is required to provide continuous patient monitoring in an effort to provide quality patient care.  A lack of continuous monitoring places an added liability on the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth.  The use of any replacement part which voids the original configuration certification (UL, JACHO, etc.) of equipment will be prohibited.  The Contractor shall maintain qualifications throughout entire contract period.  Qualification includes but is not limited to the certification of all repair persons and repair facilities by the OEM as being trained/qualified to perform required repairs.  The Government shall maintain the right to seek proof of qualification anytime during contract period of performance.  The Contractor shall provide trained, experienced, English-speaking personnel, labor, tools, diagnostic equipment, software, test phantoms, material, supplies, transportation, parts and equipment necessary to perform Preventive Maintenance (PM), Calibration (CAL), Safety Testing (ST), and Corrective Maintenance.  Additionally, the Contractor shall provide 40 hours of in-house formal OEM Factory Level Maintenance/ Service Technician training each year of contract (full life of contract).  Training will be provided for a minimum of 10 seats on topics directly related to the maintenance of equipment covered by this requirement, and the Contractor shall also include a minimum of 15 Clinical/Operator training days on equipment covered by the contract.  Topics are to be mutually agreed upon by the government and the Contractor.  Training shall include all training materials including training manuals, service manuals, and any required IT support equipment (i.e. overhead projectors, Power Point Presentation etc.).

This requirement will not utilize procedures under FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; however, the government will be using the policies contained in FAR Part12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.

<SUBJECT>A--Instrumentation and Measurement Techniques to Measure the Physical Parameters Involved During the Inflation and Descent Phases of Round Parachutes and Ram-air Inflated Parafoils
<SOLNBR>DAAD15-AADD-INSTRMEAS
<RESPDATE>103105
<ARCHDATE>12302005
<CONTACT>Allison Griffin, 508-233-4495
<DESC>The US Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Natick Soldier Center (RDECOM-NSC) in Natick, MA, is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) for white papers on instrumentation and measurement techniques to measure the physical paramet ers involved during the inflation and descent phases of round parachutes and ram-air inflated parafoils.  The objectives of the measurements are to monitor the aerodynamics and structural dynamics of parachutes (full-scale and small-scale parachutes) and t o provide a database for the verification and validation of the mathematical/computer models currently being developed by NSC to predict the performance of parachutes.  Highly sensitive, fast responding, light weight, and wireless sensors, and minimally or  non-obtrusive measurement techniques are needed to monitor the transient air flow inside and outside the parachute canopy, the structural dynamics of the canopy fabric and the overall parachute shape and motion.  Specifically, the following are the parame ters to be measured: spatial canopy position, motion and geometry, fabric strain, opening force, air velocity, air pressure, and overall flow field.  Multiple sensors are required to fully monitor the large flow field and fabric of the canopy.  Measurement s of the flow field desired include (but are not limited too) canopy surface fluid pressure, pressure field in the near wake of the parachute, velocity field in the near wake and internal flows of the canopy, and boundary layer profiles on the canopy surfa ce.  Given the significant changes in the shape and the short time in which parachutes inflate, transient measurements of all these parameters are necessary and desired.  Although it is desired to conduct full-scale parachute tests in an open atmosphere or  a free-drop environment, it is necessary to conduct some parachute experiments under more controlled conditions, such as wind/water tunnels using small-scale parachutes.  However, it is essential that instrumentation and measurement techniques be utilized  in a larger scale environment, such as parachutes deployed from an aircraft or parachutes free-dropped inside a large, high ceiling, enclosed building (such as a blimp hangar or sports arena) with the instrumentation moving with the parachute or the parac hute moving past the instrumentation at a fixed region.  Small-scale parachutes will also be tested in the free-drop environment.   	Full-size US Army parachute canopy size varies from 962 sq. ft. (35 ft. diameter) for personnel parachutes to 7,850 sq. ft. (100 ft. diameter) for cargo parachutes.  Small-scale parachutes being considered for testing range in size from 0.8 sq. ft. to 200  sq. ft. (1-16 ft. diameter).  Canopy fabrics are typically made of nylon having areal densities of 1.1  2.2 oz/sq. yd., and permeability of 0  140 cu. ft./min. at a ½-in. water pressure.  The loading density of the canopy fabric is between 0.5 and 1 lb/ sq. ft. for full-size canopies (during steady descent) and 0.1 to 0.5 for small-scale canopies.  Opening times of full-scale parachutes are on the order of seconds and those of small-scale parachutes for wind tunnel studies are less than one second.  The a ssociated peak opening forces are on the order of 5 to 10 Gs.  Vertical descent velocities are 15  30 ft/sec; some one-time use parachutes for humanitarian airdrop missions have higher descent velocities at about 70 ft./sec.  Instrumentation is generally more developed for small-scale parachutes in wind/water tunnel studies than for full-scale parachutes.  But a capability to monitor the detailed flow field of full-scale parachutes is particularly needed for parachute testing and development. All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to submit a White Paper to NSC in accordance with NSC Broad Agency Announcement 05-07 which can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil/ssbaa.htm.   Proprietary information will not be disclosed outs ide the U.S. Government.  Nothing sha ll be construed herein or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this RFI.  Firms responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter.  Responses shall be submitted by 31 Oct 2005 and may be sent via email to Calvin.Lee@Natick.Army.Mil or by regular mail to US Army RDECOM, Natick Soldier Center, AMSRD-NSC-AD-AT (ATTN: Dr. Calvin Lee), Kansas Street, Natick, MA, 01760, Telephone (508) 233-4267, Fax (508) 233-5000.

<DESC>The US Air Force is seeking information on contractor firms capable of providing advisory and assistance services (A&AS) support and capable of handling Top Secret data in support of programmatic functions in the performance of both Core Support Areas #1 and #2 described as follows.

Core Support Area #1. Firms having expertise in and able to direct efforts toward the performance of requirements in all of the following areas: 1.) Prepare strategic plans to address programmatic and budgetary management documents to ensure program success; 2) Conduct administrative tasks relevant to project management to include, but not necessarily be limited to, facilitating government project officers with coordination of acquisition requirement packages, reviewing deliverables, and tracking cost/schedule status; 3) Perform contract support assisting program lab directors in the management and operation of the government’s laboratory facility; 4) Provide statistical support to program analysts and meteorologists for data trend analysis, data interpretation, report preparation, and other related functions; 5) Provide consultation services and support from recognized experts in the following disciplines: (A) nuclear engineering analysis; (B) particle transport analysis; (C) nuclear and particle physics; (D) specialized laboratory equipment design and analysis; (E) chemical engineering and related disciplines; (F) inorganic, organic, analytical, physical, and biological chemistry; (G) molecular and microbial biology; (H) virology; (I) immunology; (J) biological engineering; (K) mechanical engineering and related disciplines; and (L) aerobiological modeling and meteorological support; 6) Provide support for information technology (databases, workgroup manager duties); and 7) Provide preparation and assistance with development of field-test plans and/or integration of program assets/initiatives into outside agency field tests to include general field test support.

Core Support Area #2. Firms able to obtain the required expertise in and be able to direct efforts toward the performance of requirements in all of the following areas: (1) Molecular biology to include genetic screening real time PCR techniques, genetic sequencing, and micro-array technologies; (2) Microbial culture; (3) Immunology to include protein screening, mass spectrometry technologies (including MSnth technologies); (4) Separation of biological materials of interest from complex sample matrices; (5) Meteorological support to include models of transport and diffusion processes; and (6) Additional technical areas of interest which may arise during any future technical performance period.  A firm is not required to have expertise in all of these Core Support Area #2 areas, but rather have the capability to manage a “team” of contractors in a business management environment that allows for the rapid acquisition of additional firms as new technologies and capabilities are identified.  The government is less interested in any team the contractor activity would respond with for purposes of this sources sought versus the overall approach a firm would utilize in managing a complex and ever changing environment and the flexibility with which new laboratories could be brought on board via the sub-contracting process.

Prospective firms are encouraged to submit a capability summary (maximum length: 10 pages) describing the firm’s expertise and related experiences in meeting the requirements stated above to the contract specialist:  daniel.gill@patrick.af.mil.  A top secret clearance is required.

Firms should indicate whether they are small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone certified, or a Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution.

Respondents should include their assigned Commercial and Government Entity Code.  Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.  Due to the nature of this potential effort, no foreign country sources will be considered.  Sources are requested to also include the Government assigned company Facility Code (also called Cage Code) for the applicable facility and stage facility that would safeguard any classified data supplied by the Government.

This is NOT a Request For Proposal (RFP), and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  No written or telephone requests for a solicitation package or further information will be accepted nor responses made. However, the Government may seek clarification by telephone.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Armament research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny, NJ, has a requirement to use .50 Caliber M82A1 Sniper Rifles to disable or destroy thin cased equipment.  The general dimension of equipment to be engaged is approximately four to six inches in length and two to four  inches in width and height.  In addition, it is desired that the cartridge also be capable of the breaching of a thin wall (1/4" to 1/2"0 of non-reinforced concrete/plaster.  The range at which these targets are to be disabled or destroyed is approximately 300 meters.  The desired effect would be equivalent to ball ammunition.  The use of current .50 Caliber combat ammunition for this task poses a severe ricochet hazard to personnel and material in close proximity to target.  ARDEC is interested in procuring and testing a frangible .50 caliber cartridge that will reduce/minimize this ricochet hazard.  At the desired ranges the cal 50 projectile shall be capable of effectively disabling or destroying the equipment, however the projectile shall be designed such that it will break apart upon impact with the ground or other hard surface to reduce ricochet hazard and minimize collateral damage to civilian personnel, friendly troops, buildings or material.  Interested vendors are requested to submit any  information describing their products ability to meet these requirements and the availability of these items.  All information is to be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  US Army-TACOM, attn:  Mary Krisanda, Contract Specialist, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, or email: mkrisa@pica.army.mil. This sources sought notice is only a Market Survey.  It is not a pre- solicitation notice, nor is it a Request for Proposals.  If a formal  solicitation is generated at a later date, an appropriate solicitation notice will be published.  Respondents to this Market Survey should submit their data within 30 days from the date of this publication.  All information is to  be submitted  at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<DESC>Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) The Office of the Program Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) desires  information on Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) concepts for all calibers of cannon  artillery projectiles.  PGK refers to a kit that will improve the Armyâ€™s  artillery projectiles delivery accuracy.  The PGK solution will improve the  accuracy and thus effectiveness of conventional artillery munitions.  The Army  is interested in fielding a PGK capability as soon as possible.  The purpose of  this announcement is to obtain industry comments on the Army acquisition  strategy as set forth below. The Army intends to solicit, negotiate and award zero to two Technology  Development (TD) awards on or about the January 2006 timeframe. This award  would be followed by an option for a Systems Development and Demonstration  (SD&D) phase and ceiling priced options for three (3) years of Production. A Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 demonstration will occur six months after  award.  TRL 6 is the System/subsystem or prototype demonstration in a relevant  environment.  The Army reserves the right to extend the TD phase of the  contract 6-12 months should TRL 6 not be demonstrated.  The Army expects to  down select to one contractor based on demonstrated results. The selected  contractor will enter a 18-30 month PGK SD&D Phase and subsequently three (3)  years of production starting in FY08 (approximately 500-1000 kits in FY08, 7500  Kits in FY09 and 7500 Kits in FY10).   This announcement is to obtain industryâ€™s feedback on the willingness to  participate in a cost sharing effort to the Armyâ€™s proposed acquisition  strategy.  It is the Governmentâ€™s intent to award Section 845 Other Transaction  (OT) agreements with the contractors providing at least one third (1/3) of the  total cost for the Increment 1 TD and SD&D phases of the program and transition  to a FAR based contract for the Production phase.  Initial awards will be only  for the TD phase.  The portions of the SOW dealing with the SD&D phase of the  overall program will only be performed by the selected contractor at the end of  the TD phase.  The Army contemplates non-competitively awarding  Increment 1  production options to the SD&D contractor based on demonstrated successful  performance and affordable cost.  It is anticipated that Increment 2 SD&D will  start on/about 1 Oct 07 for 24 months followed by three years of production   Increment 3 SD&D is anticipated to start on/about 1 Oct 09 for 24 months  followed by three years of production. The Army has limited funding and anticipates multiple awards for a performance  period of seven (7) months.  There are two possible Government funding  scenarios for the TD phase.  Scenario 1 would provide $2.5 Million in FY06 to  each of no more than two contractorâ€™s.  USG SD&D FY07 â€“ FY09 funding would be  $7 Million for FY07, $8 Million for FY08 and $2.5 Million for FY09. Scenario 2  would see the Government share rise to $5 Million each for FY06.  USG SD&D  FY07 â€“ FY09 funding would be $7 Million for FY07, $8 Million for FY08 and $2.5  Million for FY09.  The respondents should provide a plan on how cost sharing  funds would be distributed (i.e. upfront, evenly distributed).      Respondents should provide a program plan that can demonstrate TRL 6  achievement of the increment 1 requirements and show an evolutionary approach  to increments 2 and 3 as defined below.   Increment 1 performance specification summary: Accuracy with Â½ hour Meteorological (MET) data â€“ 50m Circular Error Probability  (CEP);  Platform/Maximum Propellant Charge â€“ M777, Paladin, M198/M203A1, 5  Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS);  Compatibility â€“ MIL-STD-333 Deep  Intrusion (with the exception of the protrusion of strakes, canards, deviation  of O-give diameter and external length);  Munition Type â€“ 155mm High Explosive  (HE);  Fuzing Function â€“ Point Detonating, Proximity;  Setter â€“ Enhanced  Portable Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (EPIAFS);  Allowable Projectile Range  Degradation with PGK (Maximum range/Minimum range) â€“ 0 to 10% / 0 to 5%; GPS  Signal â€“ C/A code (waiver will be required to field GPS C/A code);  GPS Black  Keys â€“ None;  Anti Jam â€“ None;  Operational Temperature (F) â€“ 0 degrees â€“ 145  degrees; Shelf Life â€“ 7 years.   Changes for Increment 2 are Accuracy with Â½ hour MET â€“ 30m CEP;  Compatibility â€“ MIL-STD-333 (with the exception of the protrusion of strakes, canards,  deviation of O-give diameter and external length);  Munition Type â€“ 155mm Bulk  and Cargo; Fuzing Function â€“ Delay, GPS Function;  GPS Signal â€“ P(Y);  GPS  Black Keys â€“ SAASM;  Anti Jam â€“ 20dB BB, 40dB Tone;  Operational Temperature  (F) â€“ (-45) degrees â€“ 145 degrees;  Shelf Life â€“ 20 years. Changes for Increment 3 are Accuracy with Â½ hour MET â€“ 30m threshold and 10m  objective CEP; Platform/Max Prop Charge â€“ NLOS-C, M119/M200;  Munition Type â€“  105mm HE and Cargo. The proposed solution should be initiated or settable with the EPIAFS prior to  projectile firing and be compatible with 105mm and 155mm US Army howitzers. Respondents should include information in the areas such as; operational  procedures; estimate delivery accuracy as a function of range; and discuss  technical challenges including proposed packaging with space claims for all  required fuze components.  The PGK solution will not significantly impact  standard operational procedures, materially impact maximum range nor degrade  projectile lethality.  Respondents should provide a Unit Cost Model based upon  production quantities of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000.  The Government will not  facilitize prospective offerors.  Any information should be based on self  facilitization.   All responses shall be sent electronically to pleasant@pica.army.mil.   This notice is for informational purposes only.  Responses are due within 10  days from the date of this notice.

<DESC>The Northern Region Contracting Center is seeking information on sources that can provide support services to the TRADOC Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training.  The Commander of the US Army Signal Center and Fort Gordon has been designate d by the TRADOC Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training as the Executive Agent for implementation of the Lifelong Learning process and Lifelong Leaning Centers, at all TRADOC proponent schools and centers. The EA has developed an executable plan to establish standardized LLCs at TRADOC schools beginning in FY 06 under the supervision of the DCSOPS&T Training Development and Delivery Directorate.  The contractor shall support the Government in the development of LLCs that provide the portal from th e proponent school to the student through the LLL system.  The contractor shall provide support for the technical implementation of a Digital Library that supports storage of simulations and web-based training software and databases which includes a compre hensive search capability.  The contractor shall offer Subject Matter Expert technical support that shall assist individuals at other locations with assistance calls concerning systems issues and problems. SMEs shall help users with technical problems and provide other information as needed.   The LLCs will make training accessible to all users at the best possible teachable moment supporting a service oriented training architecture as prescribed by the Army Enterprise Infostructure mandates. The objective is to allow soldiers access to trainin g anytime and anyplace they have access to a Personal Computer. The LLC will expand each of the Proponent Schools with an always on capability.  The LLC process will leverage cutting-edge information and simulations technologies and be adaptable to future technology evolutions that will improve the LLL process.  The contract award will be for a base and 4 option years. The Fort Gordon LLC is in its third year of development and serves as the model for further LLC development. The TRADOC proponent schools and centers will add to their current set of simulations as they develop the trainers and simulations prioritized by the Army.  The end result will be even more significant requirements for establishing, maintaining, and managi ng software databases.  It is envisioned that software for the recommended suite of trainers and simulations will reside primarily on local PCs for everyday instructional purposes and would be available on-demand from a central database location.  This cen tral location also would be responsible for configuration management and updating software to maintain currency with changes.   The simulation software is easily replicated, so that any number of users can be getting the training at the same time.  This wi de use may reduce some of the scheduling problems now facing TRADOC proponent schools, where a focus on technical AIT training could mean leadership training must be scheduled so access equipment and/or Hands-On Trainers occurs in off-hours.   At a minimum, offeror response to this Sources Sought notification shall provide: 1) documentation (not to exceed five (5) pages  front and back (or ten (10) single-sided)  standard 8 ½ X 11 pages using not less than 10-pitch font) describing the offeror s technical expertise in sufficient detail to make an informed determination of the offerors ability to successfully perform the services described above; 2) socio-economic status (Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a) certified, HubZone, Veteran-Owned, Woman -Owned, Historically Black University); 3) number and retention statistics for current employee base; and 4) past performance documentation of same/similar work dating back not more than three (3) years (this documentation shall show that the offeror has e xperience in the same/similar work described above and may include Government and non-Government contracts).  NAICS code for this procurement is 541512; business size is 21 million.  All documentation submitted in response to this notice shall be submitted in electronic format via email to the Northern Region Contracting Center (NRCC), ATTN:  Bonnie Perry, 2798 Harrison Loop Complex, Fort Eustis, VA  23604 -5538.

<SUBJECT>Request for CRADA Collaborators
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood the FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Systems Research and Technology (B) Department is seeking Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) collaborator(s) to work with investigators in the Advanced Combat System Technologies Division (B30) to identify both commercial and developmental technologies that may be integrated into Littoral Warfare Systems particularly to address the massed asymmetric threat.  Massed asymmetric threats, particularly surface threats, are most likely to occur in a littoral environment.  This environme! nt is inaccessible in the sense that no single sensor can completely determine the state of the environment.  At best, the relationships among units in this environment are too complex to predict.  The environment necessitates that distributed units be able to plan ahead, but is so dynamic and continuously valued that circumstances can change while the next action is being deliberated.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Littoral Warfare Systems play a crucial role in the coordination of distributed combat capability in a joint and coalition environment, particularly in the face of asymmetric threats. Asymmetric threats occur when enemies identify weaknesses in a disproportionately more powerful opponent, and exploit those weaknesses to perpetrate acts of terror.  (The Cole incident underscores the vulnerability of surface combatants to asymmetric threats.)  When these asymmetric threats are massed together and exhibit a swarm-like behavior their threat is multiplied.  NSWCDD is see! king capability statements from parties interested in entering into a CRADA to identify, explore and further develop enabling technologies required for Littoral Warfare Systems. The role of the CRADA collaborator(s) will include, but not necessarily be limited to: Intelligent Agents, Network Mobile Agents, and Adaptive Agents, Automated Information Processes, including Expert and Knowledge-based Systems, Distributed Computing, Multi-modal, Mobile Human Network Interaction (Virtual Environments),High Bandwidth, Secure Communication Technology, Unmanned Systems – Distributed Systems and Cooperative, Group Behaviors, Tactics-based Search and Dynamic Mission Replanning, Automated Decision Processes, Active Control Theory,  Robotics/Automation, Multi-Static Distributed Sensor System (MSDSS) for Networked Littoral Battlegroups, Cooperating Autonomous Agents. The collaborator may also be expected to contribute financial support under this CRADA for personnel, supplies, travel, and ! equipment to support these projects. The collaborator is also expected to cooperate with the NSWCDD in the timely publication of research results and to accept the legal provisions and language of the CRADA. DATES: CRADA capability statements should be submitted to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, ATTN:  Code B303, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA  22448-5100. By e-mail: DLGR_NSWC_B30@navy.mil or fax 540-653-6415.  To be considered in the first round of evaluation, capability statements must be received on or before 30 AUGUST 2005.  Evaluation will be conducted periodically on capability statements received thereafter for up to 2 years.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Universal Armament Interface (UAI)
<DESC>The Universal Armament Interface (UAI) Government team is seeking comments/inputs from Industry on the UAI Platform-to-Store Interface Control Document (PSICD) that is currently being developed by the UAI Consortium.  The UAI PSICD documents a generic interface between Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) and platforms.  The PSICD currently includes the functionality requirements for existing legacy and future PGM weapons.  The intent is to also look towards the future (10 years ahead) and to capture, to the best of our ability, the functionality requirements for PGM weapons that are currently being planned or those that we can reasonably envision.  The Air Force is specifically seeking inputs on functionality requirements for moving targets, seekers, data links (initialization, on aircraft and release) and geo-specificity (exclusion zones) but welcomes input on other requirements that Industry believes may not be sufficiently addressed in the PSICD.  Industry input is crucial to ensure the final PSICD captures the future functionality requirements that Industry believes is necessary for their future PGM weapon concepts.  As directed by ACC/DR and AAC/CC, the UAI PSICD will be the interface for future PGM weapons, and future PGM weapon designs must comply with the ICD.  This is the opportunity to ensure that the PSICD is robust enough to accommodate future PGM weapon functionality for at least the next 10 years.  The PSICD will be implemented on Air Force platforms and weapons beginning with F-15E, Suite 6, the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) MK-82 and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM)

Industry representatives willing to provide comments/inputs to the UAI PSICD should contact Audrea Feist, Deputy UAI lead, at (850) 883-3080 or audrea.feist@eglin.af.mil.
A copy of the UAI PSICD will be provided to the representatives for their review.  On Thursday, 18 August 2005, the UAI government team will host a meeting at Eglin AFB in Bldg 349, Room 301, beginning at 8:00.  A general session will be held from 8:00 – 9:30 followed by 1 hour individual sessions for interested companies.  Interested companies may contact Ms. Feist to schedule individual sessions.  For those companies not interested in attending the meeting on the 18th, comments may be emailed to Ms. Feist at the address above or mailed to the following address:  AAC/XRS, 207 West D Avenue, Suite 301, Eglin AFB FL 32542 .

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

CLIN 0004 DELIVERY OF WINDTUNNEL
The contractor shall deliver the wind tunnel to the installation site at Cal Poly Pomona, Pomona, CA.

CLIN 0005 INSTALLATION OF WINDTUNNEL
The contractor shall install a Northrop Grumman (NG)-designed model support system onto the new wind tunnel.  The model support system, shown at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/ , will be constructed under a separate contract and provided to the wind tunnel contractor for installation. The contractor shall mount the model support hardware below the test section.  This system includes a strut that extends up into the test section for mounting test models.  It provides pitch and yaw control of the model.  An Interface Control Drawing (ICD) is provided at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/.  It shows the model support hardware installation under the wind tunnel test section.  A NG-designed slotted turntable (45 inch diameter, 1/4 inch thick aluminum disk) will be installed into a circular cutout in the floor of the new test section, flush with the tunnel’s floor surface.  The disk turns with the support system for yaw control.  The strut extends through the slotted disk and pivots to give pitch control.  The support system must be positioned and leveled (with respect to the tunnel centerline when installed) so that the center of rotation of the support system coincides with the center of the test section.

The contractor shall install a base to locate the support system vertically.  The base will be attached to the floor below the test section and the support system will be mounted on top of three adjustable leveling feet.  Dimensions of the base are approximately 38 inches wide by 55 inches long by 12 inches high. (The height of the base is dependent upon the distance from the floor to the test section centerline.)  An existing base design is available from NG and will be modified  and constructed by another vendor and supplied to the wind tunnel vendor for installation under the test section.

CLIN 0006 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TRAINING SESSION
The contractor shall perform functional tests of the new wind tunnel to verify that all specifications are met and make all adjustments or corrections, as required to achieve operation and test section airflow quality within the specification.  Any negative deviation from the specifications must be approved by the AF. To verify the flow quality, the contractor shall perform a detailed calibration of the airflow in the test section of the installed wind tunnel.  This would include two-dimensional mappings (every 2 inches in the y and z directions normal to the flow direction) of flow velocity, flow angularity in pitch and yaw, and turbulence intensity at 3 (streamwise) stations along the test section: the center of the test section and two other longitudinal stations +/-20 inches from the first.

The contractor shall provide a training session for the AF and CPP personnel.  Topics include facility operation, maintenance, servicing, precautions, etc.

OPTIONAL STATEMENT OF WORK

The contractor shall design and manufacture a research wind tunnel to AF specifications.  In addition to providing a proposal that meets the specifications of CLIN 0001-0006 above, please also consider tailoring your proposal to specifically address CLINs 0007-0013 below (all optional).  If there is no additional cost from CLINs 0001-0006 associated with the inclusion of the CLINs below, please note that in your proposal.

CLIN 0007 HEAT EXCHANGER AND WATER TANK
The contractor shall purchase and install a heat exchanger/water tank to provide cooling for the wind tunnel flow using chilled water from an existing chilled water line adjacent to the wind tunnel site.  The contractor shall size the system to maintain wind tunnel flow temperature at ambient +/- 5 degrees F.  Local ambient temperatures range from 50 to 105 degrees F. It is anticipated that, without cooling, flow temperature will rise by 25 degrees F above ambient during a typical one-hour run. The contractor shall install the heat exchanger/water tank at an AF approved location near the wind tunnel, make all required hookups (electrical, water, etc.), check out operation and obtain all of the required permits.

CLIN 0008 IMPROVED FLOW QUALITY
Improve flow quality in the test section from those specified in above (Research Wind tunnel Specification) 

FLOW UNIFORMITY:  +/- 0.25% variation from average velocity or less
TURBULENCE:  0.07% turbulence intensity or less
FLOW ANGULARITY: +/- 0.1 degree variation or less in pitch and yaw (clear test section)

To achieve this improved flow quality, it is recommended that Items (a) and (b) below be considered:

a.  The contractor shall add two additional screens after the honeycomb and before the contraction cone to improve flow uniformity in the test section.

b.  The contractor shall add corner fillets to all four corners of the test section, with proper fairings upstream and downstream of the test section, to improve flow quality in the test section. Fillets are to be such as to account for growth of the boundary layers on the walls of the test section. Therefore, the test section walls shall be parallel, in pairs.

CLIN 0009 LIGHT INSTALLATION IN SECTION FILLETS
The contractor shall install lights in the test section fillets, 4 places, to improve lighting in the test section.

CLIN 0010 NOISE REDUCTION EQUIPMENT
The contractor shall provide and install noise reduction equipment (acoustic silencers) inside the wind tunnel to reduce the level of wind tunnel noise. The contractor shall specify the noise level reduction provided by the silencers (dBA) at 275 ft/sec.

CLIN 0011 WINDTUNNEL AUTOMATIC CONTROLS
The contractor shall provide automatic controls of wind tunnel parameters including dynamic pressure (q), temperature, model pitch, and model yaw.  Analog voltages will be available from the model support system for pitch and yaw.  The AF will provide the needed programming in LabVIEW.

CLIN 0012 3-D TRAVERSING MECHANISM
The contractor shall provide a motorized 3-D traversing mechanism that will be mounted inside and at the downstream end of the test section and allow for flow measurements throughout most of the test section (for example the detailed calibration of the test section flow, as described in CLIN 0006 in above).

CLIN 0013 COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS ANALYSIS
The contractor shall provide computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the flow in the test section and tunnel circuit.

52.212-1 -- Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items.
As prescribed in 12.301(b)(1), insert the following provision:
Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jan 2005)
(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --
(1) The solicitation number;
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;
(5) Terms of any express warranty;
(6) Price and any discount terms;
(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address;
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(j) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04.  The Solicitation number is SB1341-05-Q-0875. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325998 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This procurement is being competed on an unrestricted basis.

****The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for one (1) Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite Neutron Filter for MACS Incident Beam.  See attached drawing (038-0075 Rev 3.pdf) at ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/incoming.
Background
This procurement is to acquire Pyrolytic Graphite that will be used by NIST to reject unwanted high energy neutrons from the MACS neutron scattering spectrometer at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). The full width at half maximum mosaic distribution width shall be less than 15 degrees (as measured with 11.6 meV neutrons). Due to the crystalline structure of the material and the coherent nature of interactions between neutrons and carbon, neutrons with wave lengths greater than 0.23 nm will pass through this material along its crystalline c-axis with a low probability for scattering and absorption. However, shorter wavelength neutrons will generally be strongly scattered and hence rejected from the instrument as desired. 
Scope
The procurement is for a large right circular truncated conical block of oriented pyrolytic graphite to filter the beam that emanates from the NCNR cold neutron source before it reaches the MACS monochromating system. The required physical dimensions and tolerances are provided in drawing 038-0075 rev 3.
Contractor Requirements
The Contractor shall ship a first article sample plus the post-sample production lot of specified chemical purity, density, and mosaic distribution to the technical information contact (TIC). The first article sample shall be provided following award of the purchase order. The post-sample production lot shall be provided only after the Contracting Officer notification to the Contractor in accordance with Clause 52.209-4 Alt I. 

The contract line items for this request for quotation are as follows:

LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity:  One (1) Unit Each – Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite Neutron Filter for MACS Incident Beam First Article Sample that meets or exceeds the following specifications:  
First Article Sample 
The Contractor shall provide a materials first article sample that is representative of the filter material to be delivered so that compliance with specifications can be verified. The first article sample, which can itself be a laminated structure, shall have a thickness along the c-direction of 50 mm. The dimensions in both orthogonal directions perpendicular to the c-axis shall be between 20 mm and 50 mm. The first article sample shall be provided within 1 month after Contractor acceptance of the purchase order. If the sample is deemed not to meet specifications, the Contractor must submit a subsequent sample within one month of receiving written comments from the Contracting Officer regarding the deficiencies in the first sample.

LINE ITEM 0002: Quantity:  One (1) Unit Each – Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite Neutron Filter for MACS Incident Beam Post-Sample Production that meets or exceeds the following specifications:  

Post-Sample Production Requirements 
Chemical composition and Density: This specification ensures sufficient content of the desired oriented graphite majority phase. 
-	Carbon as Pyrolytic Graphite >99% by weight
-	The overall density of each the filter (taking the volume to be that defined by the corresponding drawings) shall exceed 95% of the room temperature density of Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite, which is 2.26g/cm3.
Mosaic distribution: This specification is set to maximize transmission in the 0.23 nm to 0.4 nm wave length range and to maximize efficiency as a filter for higher order neutrons. 
-	The average c-axis direction for the filter shall be parallel to the high symmetry axis (the beam direction) to within 1o. 
-	The average Full Width at Half Maximum Mosaic width for the filter as measured with 11.6 meV neutrons shall not exceed 15 degrees. 
Neutron transmission specification: This specification ensures adequate neutron transmission in the operating energy range. Factors that reduce neutron transmission are neutron absorbing impurities, lattice defects, and graphite powder inclusions.
-	The room temperature transmission of 11.6 meV neutrons through 50 mm of the material along the c-axis shall exceed 80%. 

This material must be received by NIST within six (6) months after NIST acceptance of Item 0001.
Overall Physical Dimensions and Lamination Requirements
The segment of the post-first article production run shall be delivered as an accurately dimensioned body. The physical dimensions, tolerances and surface finish are specified on the attached drawings, which is numbered 038-0075 rev 3.

The filter may be built as a laminated structures detailed by the Contractor. The following requirements ensure that the potentially laminated body can be mounted effectively and that there are no open joints along beam axis 
-	Lamination planes shall be perpendicular to the central axis of the filter.
-	This requirement is to prevent streaming through cracks in the lamination. The lamination structure shall preclude straight line neutron propagation within 10 degrees of the cylinder axis without passage through at least 35 mm solid graphite. 
-	The overall density of the laminated body with volume as defined by the corresponding drawings shall be at least 95% of the density of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. 
Other Requirements:
Certified Materials Analysis (Items 0001 and 0002)
The materials delivered under this purchase order (both first article and first article production) shall be accompanied by a certified materials analysis indicating the graphite and impurity content and the average mosaic distribution as measured through X-ray diffraction. Neutron measurements will be carried out by the TIC to determine whether the mosaic and transmission requirements are met. 
Acceptance of First-Article Testing Samples (Item 0001)
The TIC will perform at least two types of analysis on the first article sample and report the results to the Contractor via the Contracting Officer.
 
Neutron diffraction will be used to determine the mosaic distribution. 
The neutron transmission along the c-axis through 50 mm of material will be measured.

All measurements will be carried out using 11.6 meV neutrons. This energy has been chosen because it is in the middle of the useful energy range for the filters on MACS and because it is an energy where graphite can be used to remove higher order contamination.
Similar analysis may be performed on the full shipment when received to ensure compliance with specifications. Throughout the performance period, the TIC will carry out mosaic and transmission measurements as needed to ensure that the final product satisfies specifications. Such measurements will be carried out and reported to the Contractor within 2 weeks of receipt of a sample. 
Acceptance of Post-Sample Production (Item 0002)
The following acceptance tests may be carried out by the TIC for the post-sample production to ensure compliance with specifications: 

Physical inspection to assure that the dimensions and tolerances are consistent with the supplied drawings. 

Measurement of the weight of the filter to determine whether the overall density (with volume as specified by the corresponding drawing) exceeds 95% of the density of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. 

Measurement of the overall mosaic distribution of the filter using 11.6 meV neutrons. 

Neutron diffraction measurements to ensure that the average c-axis direction coincides with the high symmetry axis of the filter to within 1o.

Measurement of the neutron transmission along the c-axis and through 50 mm material for 11.6 meV neutrons. 

DELIVERY FOR BOTH ITEM 0001 AND 0002 SHALL BE FOB DESTINATION.  The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with standard commercial procedures.

Please ackowledge receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted by a  separate letter or telegram referencing the solicitation and amendment numbers.  FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OF OFFERS PRIOR TO THE HOUR AND DATE SPECIFIED MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER.  I f by virtue of this amendment you desire to change an offer already submitted, such change may be made by telegram or letter, provided each telegrarm or letter makes reference to the solicitation and this amendment, and is received prior to the opening hou r and date specified.  1)  Question:  What will the requested Portable Building be used for? 		Answer:  A Medical Building. 2)  Question:  Does the electrical inside need to be explosion proof? 		Answer:  Explosion-proof outlets are required. 3)  Question:  Is a fire rating needed for this Portable Building? 		Answer:  No special fire ratings are required. 4)  Question:  How many shelters will be needed in this Request for Quotation? 		Answer:  As per the Quantity listed at FED BIZ OPPS, 1 Each. 5)  Question:  Is the R30 Insulation a set specification?  The reason the question is asked is because R30 Insulation requires a 9 inch wall thickness, and due to this specification, it is needed because the outside dimensions would need to accommodate a 9  inch thickness.   		Answer:  R11 walls and R19 flooring and ceiling are acceptable or 			equals. 6) Question:   Would the outside dimensions need to be changed for the specified 9 inch insulation thickness? 		Answer:  No, however if any dimension changes quoted are different 			from the salient characteristics requested, ensure that the room space does 			not change. 7)  Question:  What is the heat load inside of the shelter? 		Answer:  Minimal; no major computer or electronic equipment will be 			operated or used in the building.  Standard office equipment will be used. 8)  Question:  Will this be a Communications Shelter: 		Answer:  No. 9)  Question:  The requested door size:  30 X 60 inches, is not a standard door dimension and not IAW ADA Compliance.  Is a standard door dimension acceptable? 		Answer:  Yes 10)  Question:  T-111 is standard nomenclature for the plywood exterior siding.  Steel siding would significantly extend the life cycle, and reduce the annual costs for the building, while at the same time improving the re-usable and recycle capability of the building because it can be relocated or expanded.  Further, wood siding can provide a medium for insects and support the growth of mold.  Will the Government accept minor alternates to the published RFQ where the submitter can demonstrate best value? 		Answer:  Metal exterior siding is an acceptable or equal, however, all Or 			Equals are acceptable as long as the minimum salient characteristics are 			met. 11)  Question:  How is it ensured that the replies to the solicitation are considered satisfactory and have been received?   		Answer:  Call Cheryl A. Fitch @ 775-887-7865 or email 					Cheryl.fitch@nv.ngb.army.mil or nvbids@nv.ngb.army.mil.  Ensure that 			all clauses and provisions are read thoroughly and all questions asked 			before the offer due date.
