<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 9pt 0.15in 0.0001pt 0in;">Obesity, diabetes mellitus, and higher glucose and insulin concentrations have been associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk in observational studies. The contractor will evaluate biomarkers related to obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes and pancreatic cancer risk. This will examine baseline serum concentrations of c-peptide (an indirect measure of insulin secretion), adiponectin and HMW adiponectin (an adipocyte-derived peptide implicated in both insulin sensitivity and inflammation) and transforming growth factor (TGF-B) (a marker for type 2 diabetes and subclinical pancreatitis).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 9pt 0.15in 0.0001pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 9pt 0.15in 0.0001pt 0in;">The contractor shall provide laboratory analysis of TGF-B and HMW adiponectin to be measured on up to 792 ATBC stored serum samples; adiponectin and c- peptide on up to 91 ATBC stored serum samples; leptin on up to 46 ATBC stored serum samples; and laboratory analysis of TGF-B, adiponectin, and c-peptide to be measured on up to 154 PLCO stored serum samples. In total, laboratory analysis of TGF-B will be measured on up to 946 serum samples; HMW adiponectin will be measured on up to 792 serum samples; c-peptide and adiponectin will be measured on up to 245 serum samples; and leptin on up to 46 serum samples.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.15in 0.7in 0.0001pt 0in;">NCI investigators are analyzing specimens from the PLCO Screening Trial and ATBC Study to investigate the relationship between circulating levels of c-peptide, adiponectin, HMW adiponectin, leptin, and transforming growth factor (TGF-B) and the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. The laboratory at the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research is uniquely qualified to carry out the laboratory analysis. The laboratory has measured c-peptide, adiponectin, leptin, and TGF-B under previous studies for the NCI; it is critical that the leptin assays of additional PLCO and ATBC samples to be measured by the NCI in studies of pancreatic cancer also be completed in this laboratory to ensure scientific comparability of data.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>(a) "Contractor employee" means an employee of a firm, or an individual, under contract or subcontract to the Coast Guard to provide services and who requires physical and/or logical access to information systems and/or facilities.</p>
<p>(b) Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 mandates a Federal standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for Federal employees and contractor employees. The Common Access Card (CAC) is a personal identification card for the Department of Defense/Uniformed Services and complies with HSPD-12. The Coast Guard has instituted the CAC as its HSPD-12 compliant personal identification card for contractor and subcontractor employees who are required to access a Coast Guard, Department of Defense (DOD), or other federally-controlled computer information system and/or facility, or need public key infrastructure (PKI) authentication to perform their contractual duties. The Contractor Verification System (CVS) is the automated application process for obtaining a CAC.</p>
<p>(c) Contractor and subcontractor employees working pursuant to this contract who are required to access a Coast Guard, DOD, or other federally-controlled computer information system and/or facility, or need PKI authentication to perform their contractual duties shall use CVS to obtain a CAC.<br />(d) The Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) shall serve as the CVS Trusted Agent and is responsible for creating contractor accounts in the CVS; approving, returning, or rejecting CAC applications (as applicable); re-verifying assigned contractors every six months; revoking contractor and employee eligibility for a CAC; and confiscating a CAC when the contract expires or when a contractor or subcontractor employee stops working under the contract.</p>
<p>(e) Current standards require a favorable fingerprint check and verification of an initiated or completed investigation for all incoming Coast Guard contractor personnel before CAC issuance. The COTR shall ensure that contractor personnel satisfy the security requirements for CAC issuance, and that completed fingerprint cards and electronic questionnaires for investigation processing are submitted to the U.S. Coast Guard Security Center (SECCEN).</p>
<p>(f) The COTR or Contracting Officer shall provide such forms to, or request such information from, contractor employees that may be necessary for obtaining a CAC via the CVS. Completed forms and information shall be submitted as directed by the COTR or Contracting Officer. Contractors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete information.</p>
<p>(g) Contractor or subcontractor employees who are declined a CAC via the CVS are ineligible to perform work under this contract. When an employee with a CAC is no longer performing work under this contract, the employee must return the CAC to the COTR or Contracting Officer on the same day the employee stops working.</p>
<p>(h) The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when a subcontractor's employee is required to access a Coast Guard, DOD, or other federally-controlled computer information system and/or facility, or need PKI authentication to perform contractual duties.</p>
<p>C.21 Employee Identification</p>
<p>a. Contractor employees visiting Coast Guard facilities shall provide two forms of photo identification. One shall be a contractor issued badge that includes contractor name, employee's full name, and card expiration date and the other a standard government approved identification (i.e. Driver's License) in order to obtain a Coast Guard visitor's badge prior to entry. Contractor employees shall comply with escort rules and requirements at all times, identify themselves as contractors when their status is not readily apparent, and display a visitor's badge above the waist in plain view at all times.</p>
<p>b. The contractor shall wear a Common Access Card (CAC) identification card furnished by the Government. Contractor identification shall be worn above the waist and remain in plain view at all times.</p>
<p><br />C.22 Employee Conduct</p>
<p>Contractor employees shall present a professional appearance at all times and their conduct shall not bring discredit upon the U.S. Coast Guard or the Department of Homeland Security. Contractor employees shall comply with all Government safety requirements (OSHA) when visiting or working on-site at Government facilities and aboard Coast Guard vessels or aircaft. The contractor employee shall not release any Coast Guard personnel contact information or information concerning official unit business or operations.</p>
<p>C.23Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons</p>
<p>The Coast Guard may, at its sole discretion, direct the contractor to remove any contractor employee from Coast Guard or Department of Homeland Security facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Such removal does not relieve the contractor of the responsibility to provide sufficient qualified personnel that is required to execute the contract or any task orders issued under the contract. The Contracting Officer will provide the contractor with a written rationale for removal of the employee.</p>
<p>C.24 Removal from Project Access</p>
<p>Should Contractor resources be removed from any task order awarded under this contract, the Contractor shall ensure, via coordination with the assigned COTR and Task Order COTR, that -</p>
<p>a. All access to Government facilities and systems is revoked. <br />b. The involved Coast Guard security manager(s) are notified of this removal action. <br />c. Any and all Government property, such as identification badges, keys, information technology hardware and software, etc. in the possession of the individual(s) being removed or replaced is immediately (by close of business on the day of removal or replacement) returned to the Government or transferred to other parties replacing the removed individuals.</p>

This data shall only be used to perform work required in task orders awarded under this contract. If this data is not delivered on schedule, or is unsuitable for its intended use, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer, who shall investigate this issue. The Government retains title to all Government-furnished data provided. Other rights and criteria shall be in accordance with other "Government Property" clauses incorporated into this contract.</p>
<p>C.26 Restriction on Non-Privacy Act Data</p>
<p>All data and information made accessible to the Contractor or its subcontractors in performing work under this contract that is not otherwise protected by the Privacy Act or Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) shall NOT be used or DISCLOSED by the Contractor for any purpose other than performance of work under this contract.</p>
<p><br />C.27 Billing Schedules</p>
<p>The Contractor shall invoice in accordance with the billing schedule included in the contract and each task order awarded under this contract.</p>

In order for the Offeror's technical proposal to be evaluated as "technically acceptable", the proposal must:<br />(a) Show that the proposed equipment meets or exceeds all requirements as prescribed in the Statement of Work. Proposals shall demonstrate compliance with all specifications and requirements in the Statement of Work. <br />(b) Include written documentation certifying how the equipment was tested for compliance with environmental and military specifications. Proposals shall include the following as a minimum:<br />&bull; Written documentation demonstrating the proposed equipment meets the SOW environmental requirements. <br />&bull; Written documentation demonstrating the proposed equipment meets any additional environmental thresholds included within the manufacturer's technical specifications.<br />&bull; Written documentation that the Ku band antenna and the Ku band Below Deck Equipment (BDE) are in compliance with MIL STD 461 E, Requirements for the Control of Electromagnetic Interference, (EMI) Characteristics of Sub-Systems and Equipment. <br />&bull; Written documentation that the Ku-band antenna and the Ku-band BDE are in compliance with MIL STD 464 A, Electromagnetic Environmental Effects Requirement for Systems. <br />Notes regarding the above documentation requirements:<br />&bull; If an independent testing lab is used to demonstrate compliance, vendors shall provide the lab's certification of compliance and/or the lab's written, certified test results. <br />&bull; If the vendor self-certifies the equipment (i.e. through the vendor's own lab or internal testing), the vendor shall provide dated copies of the written test plans, test procedures and test results for each test conducted.<br />&bull; All testing shall be completed before proposal submission<br />&bull; Test results shall be included as an appendix to Section 1 of the proposal and will not be included in the page count. <br />(c) Include a written description of the methodology the contractor will use to meet the requirements of SOW paragraph 1.11, TECHNOLOGY INSERTION.<br />(d) Include a written description of the vendor's proposed process for meeting the warranty service requirements.<br />(e) Include a written description of the vendor's proposed process for meeting the repair and return/Store as RFI requirement.<br />Technical proposals that are evaluated as "not technically acceptable" shall be further excluded from the evaluation process.</p>
<p>2: Relevant Past Performance. <br />Offerors with previous contract experience within the maritime environment should list and summarize their performance on similar or related contracts currently in progress or completed within the last three (3) years.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references to include specific points of contact, e-mail addresses for those contacts, contract number, contract type, contract period of performance, and brief description of the requirement. In determining whether past performance information is relevant or not relevant, consideration will be given to contracts of similar project complexity, scope, type, and schedule within the maritime environment. Offeror(s) may be asked for additional information about problems encountered and corrective actions taken when negative information has been submitted by references. If past performance information is either not relevant or not available, then the offeror will be rated neutral (neither favorably nor unfavorably). In addition, the Contracting Officer has the discretion to retrieve information via the offeror's supplied references and federal sources to include the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).</p>
<p>To be considered relevant, the offeror must have been performed within the past three (3) years within the maritime environment. All information and references are subject to verification by the Technical Evaluation Team. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information in conducting the evaluation other than the information submitted with the proposals received. The Government will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and cost control and business relations. A list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts completed during the past 3 years, a list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts currently in progress, or a combination of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts that have either been completed in the past 3 years or are currently in progress. Similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders, and/or subcontracts listed may include any contract, delivery order, purchase order and/or subcontract larger than $2,500 entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts shall list similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts as required above for proposed key personnel. Provide the following information for each contract, delivery order, purchase order, and/or subcontract:</p>

<p>The offeror may provide information on both problems encountered and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems on the contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts identified. The offeror should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts. General performance information will be obtained from the references provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Award, other government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications. Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) that received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over 3 years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply.</p>
<p><br />3: Price</p>
<p>Offerors are to submit price proposals that provide complete pricing for supplies and services in accordance with the Statement of Work (Attachment I) and CLIN Structure (Attachment II). Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of overall price or reflective of an inherent lack of management and/or technical competence or comprehension of the requirements will be further excluded from evaluation.<br />&bull; 3.1 - Price Reasonableness. The Evaluation Team will evaluate each Offeror's price proposal through adequate price competition.<br />&bull; 3.2 - Price Realism. Offeror's proposals will be evaluated for price realism by comparing their proposed prices to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The IGCE is based on historical prices for similar services and equipment that have been procured during the last five years.</p>
<p>Offerors shall complete the CLIN Structure/Pricing Spreadsheet - Attachment II of the solicitation including all fixed price line items and cost-reimbursable amounts. Offerors shall not deviate from the estimated amounts provided for the cost reimbursable CLINS.</p>
<p>Offerors shall calculate total for each line item by multiplying the quantity by the unit price. Offerors shall provide a subtotal for each year and an overall total price for the life of the contract. The Government will evaluate proposals for award purposes by adding the and overall total price for the life of the contract. The Government may, at its discretion, accept any or all separately priced line items proposed by an awardee, if that awardee's proposal for separately priced line items is sufficiently attractive.</p>
<p>The primary means of determining the "fairness and reasonableness" of proposed prices will be through competition and the comparison of the prices offered in response to this solicitation.</p>
<p>To corroborate the accuracy of the stated discounts for supplies, the Offeror should submit copies of relevant commercial price lists and/or catalogs for those items. The offered discounted prices will be compared and evaluated for realism against these catalog list prices.</p>
<p>Offerors are placed on notice that any proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical and management commitment or unrealistically low in overall price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of management and technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements.</p>
<p>Award will be made on the basis of determining the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price, which meets or exceeds the requirements in the Statement of Work.<br />E.8 BASIS FOR AWARD - LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) SOURCE SELECTION PROCESS <br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable offer conforming to this combined synopsis/solicitation will be the lowest priced technically acceptable offer. Only technically acceptable offers will be evaluated. Award will be made on the basis of determining the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price, which meets or exceeds the requirements in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p><br />E.9 FAR 52.233-2 Service of Protest (SEP 2006)(Tailored)</p>
<p>(a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed <br />directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the Government <br />Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) <br />by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of<br />filing a protest with the GAO.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) ____Are, ____are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2)____Have, _____have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) _____Are, ________are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) _______Have, _____have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

QUESTION(s)
1.  Question:   When is the desired start date to begin operations of the facilities as a DOH approved potable water system?  The delivery date specified on page 3 of the solicitation specifies a Start Date to End Date period of 6/15/10 to 9/30/10, please clarify what is expected to be delivered in this time frame.
