<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. <br /><br />1. Purpose<br /><br />Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS), Product Manager, Wideband Enterprise Satellite Systems (PdM WESS), Fort Belvoir, VA, is seeking information from large and small businesses experienced in providing and supporting military satellite control in order to gage industry capacity and capability for providing operational enhancements of the Wideband Remote Monitoring Sensor (WRMS) subsystem. <br /><br />2. Background<br /><br />PdM WESS provides worldwide support for the Joint Warfighters by providing dedicated strategic satellite ground components and long haul terrestrial microwave communication systems, technical control facilities, command center upgrades, and deployed forces infrastructure. <br /><br />PM DCATS was required to stand up satellite monitoring equipment in order to support the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellite constellations, and to provide enhancements on an as-needed basis to meet emerging mission requirements. The purpose of satellite monitoring is to ensure DoD communications that take place over these satellites occur as planned and to identify/mitigate interferences. These interferences can typically be contributed to environmental disruptions (sun/rain), unauthorized access, jamming, and operator error. This not only aids in maintaining planned communications, but enables more effective management of satellite resources.<br /><br />The current strategic monitoring locations are located at the five (5) Wideband SATCOM Operations Centers (WSOCs) and the six (6) Remote Monitoring and Control Equipment (RMCE) sites located worldwide. Each WSOC has a suite of terminals to monitor the WGS and DSCS, the older constellation of DoD satellites. As the WGS fleet grew, there was a need for extended coverage for monitoring satellites, and RMCE provides the necessary coverage by allowing the WSOCs to remotely view more satellites than normally feasible.<br /><br />Satellite monitoring of WGS is done in synchronized Spectrum Information Gathering (SIG) and in-beam monitoring modes, while DSCS is done only on an in-beam monitoring mode basis. The WSOCs are connected to each other via the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) Network (WSOMSNet). This enables the WSOCs to provide backup and overlap coverage support. Coverage is required twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. Control of the satellite monitoring equipment is required to be performed by WSOC personnel via the satellite monitoring equipment's client software that functions on the WSOC workstation computers. WSOC workstation computers are also located in CONUS management facilities where SATCOM mission planners require (non-control) access for situational awareness (SA). The management facilities are part of the WSOMSNet.<br /><br />3. Required Capabilities<br /><br />WRMS requirements are as follows:<br /><br />a) Enhance Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) Characterization.<br /><br />b) Power Control Management System (PCMS) Interface: Implement capability for WRMS to pull data from the field and compare to measured data from sensors in real time.<br /><br />c) Global SATCOM Configuration Control Element (GSCCE) Interface: Provide access through WRMS for all sub-channel powers measured on the spacecraft along with ability to compare channel predictions and measurements to aid with troubleshooting.<br /><br />d) World-Wide In-Beam: Provide capability to correlate worldwide in-beams and build global picture for operators.<br /><br />e) Wideband Satellite Trending Anomaly Resolution System (WSTARS) Interface: Integrate WRMS with new WSTARS architecture. <br /><br />f) Ground Mobile Forces (GMF) Reports: Upgrade WRMS with the ability to pull reports for all SATCOM users in the field.<br /><br />g) Spectral Warrior Integration: Enhance WRMS to allow analysis of Navy user spectrum and other SIPR type spectral information.<br /><br />h) ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) Integration: Continuous advancement of ePO utilization.<br /><br />i) Improved Spectrum Tools, such as waterfall display, peak power, better markers, ability to change colors of different traces, change background colors for easier screen capture/printing, etc.<br /><br />j) Incorporation of superior hardware that would result in increased performance, capabilities, and reliability. The Government is interested in both: 1) hardware/software solutions to replace the existing equipment and 2) hardware that could be integrated into the existing system without restricting functionality, serving as a supplement to the current suite of sensors. <br /><br />k) Develop releases that address all priority 1, 2, &amp; high-criticality 3 Software Change Requests (SCRs) and Software Problem Reports (SPRs). Criticality level is assigned by the Government, and priorities are defined as follows:<br /><br />&bull; Priority 1: Prevents the accomplishment of an essential capability; or, jeopardizes safety, security, or other requirement designated critical.<br /><br />&bull; Priority 2: Adversely affects the accomplishment of an essential capability and no work around solution is known; or, adversely affects technical, cost, or schedule risks to the projects or to life cycle support of the system, but a work around solution is known.<br /><br />&bull; Priority 3: Adversely affects the accomplishment of an essential capability but a work around solution is known; or, adversely affects technical, cost, or schedule risks to the project or to life cycle support of the system, but a work around solution is known. <br /><br />4.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. AN RFP WILL BE ISSUED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON OR ABOUT NOVEMBER 3, 2017.
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to solicit proposals to establish an Indefinite-delivery, Indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) Task Order (TO) contract to support clinical activities for continuing the Pediatric Trials Network (PTN). The successful offeror shall provide the requisite personnel, facilities and services to establish, conduct, and support pediatric clinical trials and related services including: expert consultation; pediatric clinical pharmacology; product formulation; drug distribution; and device development. Data collected from the PTN will help inform pediatric labeling, and be used to develop publications and other materials that will provide pediatricians and researchers with new information on medication disposition and response in children.</p>
<p>The main objective of this project is to create an environment by which a Contractor can operate an effective infrastructure for conducting safe and effective pediatric clinical trials and for performing ancillary activities in support of these trials. Although the primary focus of this Contract is to support the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act-Pediatric Trials Network clinical activities, NICHD also anticipates the need to utilize this Contract to acquire similar types of support for other NICHD pediatric drug development activities.</p>
<p>BPCA 2017 authorizes NICHD to identify therapeutic gaps in pediatrics, which are pediatric diseases, disorders or conditions where more complete knowledge and testing of therapeutics (including drugs, devices and biologics) can be beneficial to the pediatric population. There is currently inadequate infrastructure to perform these pediatric research clinical trials, and inadequate numbers of clinicians trained to perform this research.</p>
<p>NICHD anticipates the need to initiate activities in approximately five (5) to ten (10) therapeutic areas, with multiple therapeutic approaches for each therapeutic area. The work will be performed under individual task orders. It is therefore likely that these activities will require multiple scientific and clinical investigators with expertise in various disease areas. At the present time, NICHD is anticipating, but will not be limited to, initiating studies in the following therapeutic areas:</p>
<p>&#61607; Cardiovascular diseases, including the treatment of hypertension; <br />&#61607; Infectious diseases; <br />&#61607; Respiratory diseases, including the treatment of asthma; <br />&#61607; Gastroenterology;<br />&#61607; Acute Care;<br />&#61607; Neonatal therapeutic areas;<br />&#61607; Obesity related pharmacology;<br />&#61607; Biodefense;<br />&#61607; Neuro/Psych;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) along with the Contractor, may interact with researchers who either currently are (or will be) performing pre-clinical and clinical trial activities with researchers engaged in other NIH trials, e.g., the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).</p>
<p>As a result of this announcement the NICHD anticipates awarding a single cost reimbursement completion IDIQ type contract with a period of performance of eight (8) years beginning on or about March 14, 2018. The NICHD anticipates the Request for Proposals (RFP) for this study will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/) on or about November 3, 2017. Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after the RFP issue date. Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this pre-solicitation announcement. This acquisition has been designated as a full and open competition under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541715 (formerly 541712) with a size standard of 1,000 employees. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>This is not an RFP and this notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>
<p>Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted in writing to Angela Wish, Contract Specialist, at angela.wish@nih.gov. The secondary point of contact is alice.pagan@nih.gov. The RFP No. is NIH-NICHD-OPPTB-2018-2. All correspondence must cite the RFP Number.</p>

<p><br />Issue Date: 20 OCT 2017 - Closing Date: 4 NOV 2017 - 2PM EST (EDT)</p>
<p><br />ITEM DESCRIPTION- Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement for the procurement of Part Number (P/N) 02695000-100-001, Common Chassis, 5 each (ea); P/N 02694007-150-001, Single Board Computer, 1 ea; P/N 02692000-100-01, RF Downconverter, 4 ea; P/N 02694001-100-001, IF Power Divider, 4 ea; P/N 02694002-100-001, Resolver, 4 ea; support the PMA-290 Maritime Patrol Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA).</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT- The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source Sierra Nevada Corporation, 444 Salomon Circle, Sparks, NV 89434-9651, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)), only one responsible source.  This is intended to be the second Job Order under N0016417GJV04.</p>
<p>The basis for restricting competition is the lack of sufficient technical data and duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source.  The duplicative cost and delay are comprised  from the cost to procure, re-tool, reverse engineer, generate acceptance test procedures, perform first article testing, acquire flight certification, underway for sub-surface platforms, and perform stress analysis, which would take a minimum of 3-5 years for development, production, and verification.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Vendors shall be registered and active at the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov at time of offer. 

As this is a Total Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Set-Aside, Vendors shall also be registered and active at VA Vendor Information Pages at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/ at time of offer.

The VA follows requirements specified by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Vendors shall have proper Wholesale Drug Distributor state-issued license at time of offer. 

Please refer to Section E of Solicitation for Quote Submittal Instructions and Evaluation Factors.






(m) Instructions for Quote Submittal 

Technical questions shall be addressed via e-mail only to Doug Reed, Contracting Specialist, at mark.lojewski@va.gov by Offer Due Date/Time specified in Block 8 of SF 1449.

Pricing, Copy of State-Issued Wholesale Drug Distributor License, and Signed Standard Form (SF 1449) of Solicitation shall be e-mailed to Mark Lojewski, Contracting Specialist, at mark.lojewski@va.gov by Offer Due Date/Time specified on Block 8 of SF 1449: 

Vendors shall submit pricing on Solicitation Attachment 1 (Quote Spreadsheet) 

Pricing submitted shall be on Microsoft Excel format of Quote Spreadsheet. Alternate formats, including PDF format, will not be accepted. Vendors proposing alternate National Drug Codes (NDC) for items and/or alternate delivery dates for items shall list these on the Quote Spreadsheet.

Vendors shall submit copy of State-Issued  Wholesale Drug Distributor License

VA follows U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) regulations to ensure reputable, properly licensed wholesale drug distributors.

For DSCSA purposes, generally any entity that engages in the distribution of a drug to a person other than a consumer or patient or receipt of a drug by a person other than the consumer or patient  is considered a wholesale distributor. See section 581(29) & 503(e)(4)) of the DSCSA. If the entity is actually buying and selling the drugs, they are conducting activities that constitute wholesale distribution and should be licensed as a wholesale distributor. If the entity is actually buying and selling the drugs, they are conducting activities that constitute wholesale distribution and shall be licensed as a wholesale distributor. 

Third party logistics providers (3PL) are not eligible to submit a quote. A 3PL is defined in the DSCSA as an entity which  provides or coordinates warehousing, or other logistics services of a product in interstate commerce on behalf of a manufacturer, wholesale distributor, or dispenser of a product, but does not take ownership of the product nor have responsibility to direct the sale.  Because the Government is seeking firms to procure drugs for the VA, by definition, 3PLs do not take ownership nor have the responsibility to direct the sale of the drugs. Therefore, 3PLs are not eligible. 

This is also applicable in regards to vendors citing  drop shipment  provisions of the DSCSA as the reason for licensure not required. Section 582(f) of the FD&C Act exempts wholesale distributors who,  do not physically handle or store product,  from certain provisions of section 582 involving product tracing and product identifiers. While the  drop shipment  description may apply to the awardee(s), it does not exempt them from the requirement that they be licensed as wholesale distributors. 

3) Vendors shall sign and submit SF 1449 of solicitation. By signing, vendor acknowledges all solicitation amendments (if applicable) and certifies IAW FAR 52.209-5 (Representation by Corporations Regarding An Unpaid Tax Liability or Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law) that Vendor: 

Does not have any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability. 
Vendor, including its officers or agents acting on its behalf, have not been convicted of a felony criminal violation under a Federal or State law within the preceding 24 months

VISN 21 Las Vegas
Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC)
Solicitation Number: VA701-17-R-0092


The Department of Veterans Affairs, Program Contract Activity Central (PCAC) intends to solicit and negotiate with Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns for the purposes of entering into an Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) at the Las Vegas VA Medical Center (VAMC). The VA will utilize the Department of Energy (DOE) Qualified List of Energy Service Companies (ESCOs). The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330 and the Small Business Administration Size Standard is $38.5 million. ESPCs are multi-year contracts authorized under 42 U.S.C.  8287 for the purposes of achieving energy savings and benefits ancillary to that purpose.

Through ESPCs, prequalified ESCOs develop, finance, implement, and perform measurement & verification on energy conservation measures (ECMs) for federal agencies at no upfront cost to the installation or agency. The return to an ESCO is a contractually determined share of the energy cost savings generated by the ESPC project. Prior to award of a contract, the ESCO conducts a comprehensive energy audit and identifies improvements to avoid facility energy costs and energy related operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The ESCO guarantees annual cost savings upon implementation of the ECMs and privately finances the investment. The delivery schedule is amortized to allow the federal agency customer to pay for ESCO services and debt service from annual cost savings over the term of the contract.

The VA estimates that the solicitation and related amendments will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS and the VA Vendor Portal on or around August 24, 2017.  Instructions to register for the VA Vendor Portal are attached to this posting.  Offerors are required to submit offers via the VA Vendor Portal.

Any responsible Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business who has been verified as such through the Vets First Verification Program and is on the DOE Qualified ESCO List may submit an offer upon release of the solicitation.

All Offerors must be registered in the SAM database prior to award of a contract, this can be found at www.SAM.gov.  Additionally, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses must be registered and CVE verified in the VetBiz registry at www.vetbiz.gov.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for the Use of Automotive Radar Technologies to Provide 360&deg; Situational Awareness (SA) for Army Rotorcraft in Degraded Visual Environments (DVE)<br />Updated: 9 May 2016
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for the use of low-cost, mass-produced automotive radar technologies to enhance 360 Situational Awareness (SA) on rotorcraft. The objective is to determine whether such radars, possibly with modifications, could provide capabilities such as collision avoidance during in-flight operations, obstacle avoidance during take-off and landing (especially under DVE conditions), and a threat warning of bullets, RPGs and other projectiles passing within several tens-of-meters of the rotorcraft.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation; no award will be made as a result of this request. This Request for Information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and/or materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.</p>
<p>Description:<br />The United States Army, Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Intelligence &amp; Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD), Radar Systems and Identification Division (RSID) is conducting this RFI to determine the capabilities of pre-existing automotive radar technologies for use on Army rotorcraft. These radars could be used as:</p>
<p>1. A collision avoidance aid during in-flight operations where several rotorcraft might be flying in close proximity, especially during DVE conditions (e.g. rain, fog, snow, dust storms, night, smoke, etc.).</p>
<p>2. A landing and take-off aid in various DVE conditions (e.g. brownout, fog, smoke, rain, etc.). For example, making the pilot aware of obstacles to the left or right if a lateral maneuver is required.</p>
<p>3. A threat warning system for detecting and determining the angle of ground fire passing near the rotorcraft.<br />Notionally, a Distributed Aperture System (DAS) comprised of suitably-modified, lightweight automotive radar sensors would be positioned about the rotorcraft to achieve 360 degree or spherical SA. The Radio Frequency (RF) DAS will be used to supplement a forward looking sensor suite for pilotage. The forward looking sensor suite will notionally include a mmW Radar, a Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) camera, and Lidar. The DAS may also include other sensors (e.g. high-performance Electro-Optical/Infra-Red (EO/IR)). The wide-angle information obtained from the DAS would be registered and fused with the narrow field-of-regard information obtained from the forward-looking sensors and with digital terrain elevation data (DTED) (e.g., DTED to provide a seamless, head-tracked image to the operator that enables pilotage in various DVEs (e.g. brownout, fog, smoke,<br />rain, etc.). The RF DAS must include the processor and algorithms necessary to provide the types of information described above.</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>CERDEC I2WD RSID desires a low-cost, spherical-coverage RF DAS that can meet the needs of the Army Aviation community for SA in DVE conditions. While latency and range requirements are not specified, they will be considered. The desired RF DAS will be modular. The system is intended for the legacy fleet.</p>
<p>Response</p>
<p>RSID welcomes white papers and vendor teaming is encouraged to provide the full capability requested. White papers should not exceed 20 pages in length. The white paper should include an executive summary of no more than 2 pages that conveys how the proposed system addresses the goals of the RFI, the current maturity of the system, an outline of the proposed development tasks, and the schedule and budget required. Proposed systems must be at least Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 to be considered.</p>
<p>For existing systems, vendors are asked to supply the following information:</p>
<p>&#61623; A self-assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the current system.</p>
<p>&#61623; System specification and a self-assessment (measured performance) of discrete capabilities.</p>
<p>&#61623; Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) data</p>
<p>&#61623; Aircraft integration information (e.g., power requirements, data requirements, timing requirements).</p>
<p>For developmental systems (this includes systems with some existing equipment, but for which there is a plan to augment with some novel technology), vendors are asked to supply the following information:</p>
<p>&#61623; Current/proposed schedule</p>
<p>&#61623; Current TRL and projected TRL at planned completion</p>
<p>&#61623; Any available performance data</p>
<p>White papers should also address the following:</p>
<p>&#61623; For RF DAS algorithms, it is anticipated that the algorithms would be modular in nature. Describe each software module in terms of its required inputs and outputs, and the interdependencies on the other modules within the system.</p>
<p>&#61623; Describe how specific modules address each requested capability of the desired system individually and as an ensemble/system. Also highlight any SWaP-C benefits achieved through this architecture (if they exist).</p>
<p>&#61623; Describe how the data from multiple sensor modules will be accessed to provide a system level capability. Describe the current state (if any) of this development work.</p>
<p>&#61623; Describe how the RF DAS will be integrated (notionally) into an aircraft's avionics.</p>
<p>&#61623; Provide a Technology Roadmap detailing path to achieve this document's requirements</p>
<p>&#61623; Provide specifications and performance metrics of relevant systems</p>
<p>&#61623; Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for development cost, if applicable, and unit cost for potential future Government procurements, based on 1500 units. The white paper should also address any other features of your system that may enhance overall aircraft capabilities (current and proposed new technologies).</p>
<p>Only responses from U.S. owned businesses or organizations will be accepted; no responses from Foreign Nationals will be accepted. The data received in response to this RFI is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements or commit the Government or vendor to any action. It is desirable that data be received with government purpose rights. However, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. Clearly mark all proprietary information. Only Unclassified or Unclassified//For Official Use Only responses will be accepted.</p>
<p>All responses to this market research shall be submitted no later than 4:00 PM EST (local time at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD) on 17 June 2016. All questions and white papers must be submitted via e-mail to: usarmy.apg.rdecom-cerdec.mbx.i2wd-radar-rfi@mail.mil. No telephonic inquiries or requests will be entertained. Submissions larger than 5MB should be submitted through the AMRDEC Safe Access File Exchange at https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/SAFE/.</p>

Login.gov currently publishes a DMARC&nbsp;record in informational mode only.
<p>Login.gov intends to publish a DMARC policy to tell email receivers to send reports to the vendor.  When email providers receive email that purports to be From @login.gov, they will&nbsp;send information to the vendor selected by Login.gov's policy.</p>
<p>Email providers will:<br />-Send aggregate reports of how many messages passed or failed DMARC checks<br />-Send forensic reports only for fraudulent messages that failed authenticity checks. <br /><br />These reports commonly include message headers and metadata, but not message content.</p>
<p>The Government is currently performing market research to determine industry capabilities in:<br /><br />-The DMARC vendor receives these aggregate reports and forensic reports, and creates<br />analytics dashboards and performance over time<br />-Login.gov team members then can view these aggregate reports and forensic reports</p>
<p>All information flows from email providers to the DMARC vendor, so Login.gov is not sharing any additional information with third parties, only directing third parties in how they may share&nbsp;these reports. The aggregate reports do not contain any PII.</p>
<p>Forensic reports typically contain email headers, which can contain email addresses and<br />information about what email servers a message passed through. But these reports are only sent for messages that fail authenticity checks, which could happen if the message was truly&nbsp;fraudulent, or the email provider modified the message to invalidate the email signatures, or if&nbsp;Login.gov made a major programming error and was not correctly signing messages.</p>
<p>Interested vendors should respond to this request for information by:<br />- Emailing the contracting officer a written response at ALBERTO.MUNOZ@GSA.GOV<br />- Outlining their potential solution including technical details and pricing<br />- Providing their identifying information</p>
<p>This is a request for information only.  Responders will be notified if/when the Government follows the request for information with a procurement action.</p>

<DESC>This is a small business sources sought notice. This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) does not intend to award a contract based on responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this sources sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a request for quote (RFQ). There is no solicitation available now. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this sources sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 622110 with a size standard $38.5M. Based on the responses received from this sources sought announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a total small business set-aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this sources sought announcement must have the capabilities to provide the services as stated below.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Cardiovascular Intervention Program performs approximately seven to fourteen cases annually of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) - a form of treatment for stenotic coronary arteries commonly associated with coronary heart disease - on patients in the NIH Clinical Center (CC). Although uncommon, major procedural complications associated with PCI can be life threatening and require immediate, invasive surgery. Neither the NHLBI nor the CC has a full-time cardiothoracic surgeon capable of responding to such emergencies. For this reason, the CC requires the NHLBI to have an agreement with a local medical center which ensures around-the-clock access to a qualified cardiothoracic surgeon to perform emergency surgery on NHLBI's PCI patients.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>To comply with CC policy, the NHLBI requires around-the-clock cardiothoracic surgical back-up coverage for its patients undergoing PCI treatment. Should an emergency occur with a patient, the NIH will transport the patient from the CC to Contractor's facilities where the patient will receive complete medical attention from Contractor's medical staff including any emergency surgery necessary to resuscitate the patient.</p>
<p>Tasks to be Performed</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide full-time, around-the-clock cardiothoracic surgical back-up coverage for NHLBI's patients undergoing PCI treatment at the NIH Clinical Center. Specifically, the contractor shall ensure a team of qualified medical staff is on-call 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week to perform emergency cardiothoracic surgery on NHLBI's patients at the contractor's location. The medical staff shall consist of certified physicians including, but not limited to, a cardiothoracic surgeon capable of performing highly complex and invasive surgical procedures necessary to address a wide variety of PCI complications. The contractor shall ensure NHLBI's patient(s) receive complete medical attention from the contractor's medical staff including any emergency surgery necessary to resuscitate the patient.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance for these services is one (1) year from date of contract award.</p>
<p>Capability Statement / Information Sought</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize itself with the requirements of this project. Failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk. The following information shall be included in the capability statement:</p>
<p>-	A general overview of the respondents' opinions about the difficulty and / or feasibility of the potential requirement, and any information regarding innovative ideas or concepts.</p>
<p>-	Information in sufficient details of the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.</p>
<p>-	The respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code: 622110 with a small business size standard of $38.5M.</p>
<p>-	Any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the requirements of the potential acquisition.</p>
<p>Capability statements must demonstrate experience with similar projects and will be evaluated by the following criteria:</p>
<p>-	Due to the severity of cases that this requirement involves, it is imperative that the NIH can transport its patients to the contractor's facilities in a timely manner. Travel time more than five minutes compromises the health and safety of such cases and greatly diminishes the chances of resuscitation. Therefore, to be considered for award, the offeror must verify that its surgical facilities are located within a five-minute drive and/or a one-mile radius from the NIH Clinical Center (CC) located in Bethesda, Maryland. Offerors whose surgical facilities are more than a five-minute drive and/or a one-mile radius of the CC will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Closing Statement</p>
<p>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed five (5) single-sided pages (including all attachments) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above.

<p><br />A. Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to the NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge.</p>
<p>The DIR-NHGRI- Undiagnosed Diseases program (UDP) protocol 76-HG-0238, Clinical Trial Number: NCT00369421 are connected to this clinical testing, which began in 2008 as a vehicle for admitting patients with broader range of inborn errors of metabolism. Under this observational protocol study, patients with long-standing, complex undiagnosed diseases are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for comprehensive evaluation to discover new genetic disorders and/or potential treatments. The UDP program has made 47 diagnoses, which is about 20% of the total number of patients seen in this protocol to date. The Researchers in the Protocol study intend on diagnosing and treating certain inborn errors of metabolism. By doing this, researchers hope to expand their knowledge about these disorders and provide access to patients of interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience. Patients enrolled in this protocol have been referred with a known or suspected inborn error of metabolism, heritable disorder, or genetic predisposition. Patients participating in this study will be examined and treated on an outpatient basis, if practical. However, patients requiring specialized tests or treatments will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center as necessary. Researchers will use only accepted medical procedures in diagnosing (medical history, physical examinations, X-ray studies, eye examinations, blood tests, and urine tests) and treating the patients involved in this study. Additional tests may be required on a case by case basis. UDP has a critical need for expertise in clinical and laboratory genetic services, a key component in current and future clinical study results.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING REQUESTED UNDER THIS NOTICE. 

This Sources Sought Notice is for market research purposes to identify interested firms for the potential requirement detailed below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 325199 (All Other Basic Organic Chemical Manufacturing) and the size standard is 1,250 Employees.  The Government will review the information requested in this announcement to determine the type of set-aside (if any) for this requirement, should it come to fruition.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL) has a requirement for acid vials for use in Water Resource Discipline (WRD) water sampling and testing programs.  The USGS, WRD, and NWQL strive to maintain national consistency in all of the environmental samples collected by their personnel. The scientific analytical data from these samples is available and presented for use by other agencies and the public. It is extremely important that the supplies acquired hereunder be of high quality and will continue to provide consistency with the data that has been obtained, in some cases, for over a decade.  Consistency in data is critical for the NWQL and USGS programs across the country for which the Lab does analysis, and only high quality items will allow for this.  Unlike commercial labs, the NWQL, and the USGS programs they support, monitor trends in the data.

Acid vials containing the following acid solutions must meet the following brand name or equal specifications:

1.) Manufacturer:  Thermo Fisher Scientific:

Product:  2.0 mL, 7.5-7.7N Ultrex grade nitric acid solution, in a 4.5mL polypropylene (PP) copolymer screw cap vial (polyvials).  

The Ultrex nitric acid solution, packaged in a polypropylene screw cap vial, is to be used for preserving water samples prior to analysis.  These polyvials will be used in conjunction with 250 mL acid rinsed natural high-density linear polyethylene bottles. Analyses are conducted after the water sample is taken with the preservative added.  The components shall meet the following specifications:

a. The screw cap vials shall be 4.5mL capacity and made of polypropylene (PP) copolymer. Vials are to be filled with 2.0 mL of 7.5-7.7N Ultrex nitric acid solution and then capped.  The measurement tolerance shall be 2.0 mL delivery +/- 0.2 mL. The polyvials shall be bottom filled to prevent a defective seal.

b. Each polyvial shall be clearly labeled with the mixture contents, lot number and the appropriate volume. The label shall be placed on the union of the cap and vial. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) or Safety Data Sheet (SDS) shall be provided.

c. The vials shall be packaged in a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved styrofoam box which accommodates 24 vials. Each package shall be designed and sealed to guard against breakage and leakage.

d. Contamination levels of the following metal constituents shall be less than the report levels described below when prepared to the equivalent of 1 vial volume added to 250mL of deionized water.

<p>ANC Administration Building Renovation. Construction estimate $5-$8 M</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br />The overall aim of this project is to update, repair, and refurbish this late 20th Century building: some of the spaces will be reconfigured to accommodate current needs, asbestos abatement is needed, some spaces will be updated and code compliance of some elements is needed. Most of the work will be on the interior. Some work is needed on the exterior cladding, the roof, and exterior steps. Currently, the building has no fire protection elements; this deficiency will be corrected. The Administration Building contributes to ANC's National Register Historic District; a report concerning the architectural character identifying the visual aspects of the building has been done and should be used as a reference during this project. A technical assessment of the building was also done in 2015-16 and will be used as a reference for this project. (Waller, Todd, &amp; Sadler, Architects with others, 2016)<br /><br />The Administration Building is critical to the interment process at the cemetery. Many funeral participants meet in one of the three family rooms or the lobby. However, after 40 years of use, the building does have some areas that need to be repaired and updated so that the building can fully serve the users. Repairs to the building envelop will increase energy efficiency, stop some minor leaks, and prolong the life of the building. While the building appears to be accessible to people with special needs, many of its features do not comply with current regulations for accommodation. Updating some features will help visitors and staff with special needs. Many of the finishes and the lighting are original to the building and need to be replaced, cleaned, or updated for better energy efficiency, a more appropriate appearance or function, and to keep the building in good repair. Asbestos containing ceiling have interfered with updating the HVAC system. To address the existing thermal comfort issues, sound transmission issues, many of the asbestos containing ceilings will need to be redesigned.<br /><br />During the renovation of the building, the functions and staff that normally reside in this building will be housed in a number of temporary buildings adjacent to this site. Deliberate, prompt progress on this project is needed to minimize inconvenience to the staff and mourners.</p>
<p>PROJECT NARRATIVE:<br />The Administration Building was designed by the Mills-Petticord Partnership, and completed in 1976. It is approximately 10,455 square feet/floor, two stories and the roof is approximately 11,236sf. Nestled on grass-covered ground, a tree-lined lot separates the Administration Building at Arlington National Cemetery from pedestrian paths, parking lots and acres of headstones. Contributing to the Cemetery's National Register Historic District, it houses family rooms, the executive staff, honor guards, chaplains, and operations offices. The building is essential to the interment process at the cemetery. Many funeral participants meet in one of the family rooms or the lobby.</p>

<p>&nbsp;KEY FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION:</p>
<p>Besides the objectives identified in Project Narrative above. There are several planning factors that should be considered when developing response. <br /><br />1) The Administration Building is considered the "Heart and Soul" of the Arlington National Cemetery because the staff who plan, coordinate, and participate in the funeral services work in this building and most of the mourners coming to funerals gather in this building. Given the high visibility, contractors should expect frequent RFIs regarding status and progress. In addition, expect senior government officials making random appearances to monitor progress and asking their own questions. Monthly reports with photos will be expected, along with weekly overview submission covering the highlights of the week's events.</p>
<p>2) Set up of Temporary Facilities. The temporary facilities will be contractor provided. The Arlington National Cemetery senior leaders who normally reside in the building will have to be relocated to a temporary facility while the work is being performed. The temporary facility will also be expected to provide space for families attending funerals, the executive staff, honor guards, chaplains, and operations offices. The building is essential to the interment process at the cemetery. Many funeral participants meet in one of the family rooms or the lobby. Giving the role these facilities provide for Arlington National Cemetery it is paramount that the facility be suitable in terms of exterior and interior characteristics, quality and finish for is occupants.</p>
<p>3) Contractors could expect long days. With up to 30 funerals taking place between 8:30 A.M. and 3:30 P.M. Contractors could expect delays in the performance of noise producing construction. The majority of the work would be expected to be performed during the off hours of Arlington National Cemetery.</p>
<p>4) Noise Consideration. Given that Arlington National Cemetery will be maintaining normal operations throughout the duration of this contract, contractors would be expected to use the least noise disturbing method practical in order to not disturb those who are attending gatherings in the temporary facilities.</p>
<p>5) Timely completion of schedule. Given the displacement of the senior leaders and impact of the families using temp facilities, completion of this project on time will be one of the most important factors followed closely by quality. However, even though scheduling is one of the most important factors, it is not at the expense in obtaining a fair and reasonable price.</p>

PC replacement for Room 3
Cannon PC that drives the digitizer pad in our room 3 (Toshiba Kalare) has died and must be replaced with the same version PC to work as the digitizer PC.  Toshiba is the manufacturer's recommended service provider for the equipment for correct interface.  

This digitizer pad PC is part of an image digitization system that we bought from Toshiba along with this R&F room.  3 years ago Toshiba stopped supporting this system under contract so we have been going without and just repairing when it breaks. 

The end results expected from this contract are a fully functional digitizer pad that we can use in the 3 places that it needs to work for us to fully cover radiology expectations.

Specifically we need a replacement PC, running windows 7, to be installed and interfaced with our current system such that the techs can continue to use this room in the manner that they have been trained.

The quantity is definite at one fully interfaced PC that makes the digitizer pad return to normal functionality.

Any directions or other documentation needed for install will be brought by the FE.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source IDIQ Contract<br />ACC-APG intends to solicit and award a sole source IDIQ contract to CUBRC, Inc., 4455 Genesee Street, Buffalo, New York, 14225-1955.<br />The requirement will further develop and implement the Common Core Ontologies (CCO). <br />The CCO has various uses including enterprise-scale transformation of data from disparate data sources (with unique data models) into a common semantic form, which then enables enterprise-scale non-stovepipe data deduplication, fusion, integration, and interoperable analytics. CCO, as a common enterprise semantic language, will also enable Natural Language Processing (NLP) engines and pipelines to output data in this common form and thereby be fused with other forms of data. It could also be used for semantic message brokering, where a message (with unique semantics) is transformed into the common CCO form and then transformed again into any number of other message forms. <br />Prior competitive efforts for this requirement we obtained through a competitive Broad Agency Announcement and various task orders.<br />This sole source requirement meets the conditions of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source has been identified as the only company that can fully perform all the levels of technology.<br />Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a request for bids, quotes or proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712. A Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract is contemplated for this award. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, however, all responsible sources that believe they can meet all of the requirements may contact the POC listed in this announcement. If no responses are received by 14:00 Eastern Time on April 6, 2016 a sole source contract will be pursued with CUBRC, Inc.<br />

All submission costs, travel costs plus other associated costs relating to the presentation of information in response to this RFI will be at vendor's expense.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI):</p>

<p>Background<br />The DHA is continuing to evolve its information technology (IT) infrastructure and is deploying a medical community of interest (MEDCOI) network. This network is an enterprise VPN service providing access and connectivity among our users in our medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and our IT systems. In this context, the DHA is interested in the topics addressing cyber security, integration of medical devices to include standardization and compliance, cloud service providers and it's capabilities for business intelligence or the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), business process re-engineering and analytics, home-health/Telehealth solutions, and development of effective cyber governance oversight and structure.</p>
<p>Description<br />DHA will use the information provided to determine those areas that would most benefit DHA and provide the highest return of investment. Some vendors may be asked for follow-on meetings after this event to gain more information on how we can work together with Industry to provide innovative solutions for the Military Health System in the future.<br />&emsp;</p>
<p>Requested Information<br />The submitted documentation and content becomes the property of the United States Government and will not be returned.

<p>Company Information<br />&bull; Business Name<br />&bull; Business Address<br />&bull; Website URL<br />&bull; Proposed presenters (limited to two)<br />o Last, First MI/Title<br />&bull; CAGE Code<br />&bull; DUNS Number<br />&bull; Small or Large Business<br />o If small, list certification programs and socio-economic categories</p>
<p>White Paper Outline<br />&bull; Discussion of Topic of Interest<br />&bull; Value to the DHA<br />&emsp;</p>
<p>Topic List<br />For the purposes of this market research, a company is allowed to select one topic and submit one response from the following list:</p>
<p>1. The DHA is interested in learning about a comprehensive IT discover, capture, and tracking system for resources attached to the Medical Community of Interest (MEDCOI) network, providing on-demand (i.e., near real-time updating) identification and reporting for resources on the network and in the data centers, and for the provisioning of these resources. The DHA is also interested in solutions that integrate existing tool sets deployed for these purposes.</p>
<p>2. The DHA is interested in solutions and strategies that provide for the safe, secure, and effective clinical and functional integration and management of medical devices for the Military Treatment Facilities.</p>
<p>3. The DHA is interested in cloud service strategies and approaches to improve application performance and IT services. Minimum requirements include: FEDRAMP Level IV/potential V, Moderate/Moderate High, requirements, Cloud Infrastructure Stack management, DHA security requirements, and DoD HIPAA privacy and security for IT requirements.</p>
<p>4. The DHA is interested in how industry can assist with transforming our current processes into enterprise processes that are efficient, repeatable and cost sensitive to our shrinking budget: Demonstration should be through the use of a lifecycle cost model and process workflows that show the "as-is" and 'to-be" based on the vendor's solution and model/processes to be implemented. Products of interest are:<br />&bull; Service Desk<br />&bull; SCCM<br />&bull; Desktop support<br />&bull; VDI<br />&bull; Network Operations<br />&bull; The ability to spin up or down capacity and necessary support for servers, SAN storage, and database management</p>
<p>5. The DHA is interested in learning about Telehealth solutions that enhance the ability of clinicians and clinical teams to provide primary, behavioral, specialty, emergent, and critical care to patients in clinic-based, home/community, field, and austere settings. Solutions should assume technical and environmental resources and challenges that would be common to the targeted settings (e.g., intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth, and potentially harsh environmental conditions in field and austere settings; access to consumer-grade connections in home and community settings). Solutions of interest may be either synchronous or asynchronous, as appropriate to the service being delivered. The intention is to provide tools to improve access, timeliness, and quality of medical, behavioral, health, and health education services to patients, and to improve the medical and behavioral readiness of Service Members and their families. The platform and data must be compliant with DOD, HIPAA, NIST, and DHA standards.</p>
<p>6. The DHA is interested in learning about how to establish an effective organizational cyber governance structure that will provide guidance and policy, and act as an oversight authority for the MHS, as well as the provide tools and technology to facilitate the ongoing management and administration of these processes.</p>
<p>7. The DHA is interested in learning about how to aggregate disparate data sources from across its entire portfolio of systems, registries, and programs of record. We are looking to learn industry best practices on where/how to host the aggregated data, perform analytics, and business intelligence in a consolidated, turnkey and efficient manner. As the DHA matures with these areas of interest we will parlay these efforts to future predictive and proscriptive analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence efforts. Areas of interest include:<br />a. Business Intelligence<br />b. Distributed file systems and clustering <br />c. Data Lakes<br />d. Data Environments in the Cloud<br />e. Data Aggregation<br />f. Data Abstraction</p>
<p>Please provide information on how you would satisfy these requirements, and other information that would be useful to the DHA.</p>
<p>Each presentation has a block of 30 minutes. Each vendor selected will have 15 minutes to present, 10 minutes Q&amp;A among the panel, and 5 minutes to switch for the next vendor's presentation. These times are strict and non-negotiable.</p>
<p>Determination of Eligibility<br />The Government reserves the right to make final determinations as to the mix (numbers, type, capability category, etc.) of small and large business vendors it may choose to invite to participate.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. While the Government does not encourage responders to submit Proprietary or trade secret information, the Government will handle and safeguard all such appropriately marked information received in response to this RFI in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages resulting from the misuse or disclosure of any proprietary or trade secret information that is not properly identified as such.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Defense Health Agency will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future acquisition, if one is initiated.</p>

<p><br />Issue Date: 20 OCT 2017 - Closing Date: 30 OCT 2017</p>
<p><br />The Government is issuing this RFI/sources sought announcement as part of market research for Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) assemblies (General Digital's Part Number 90-3064-010-C) for the Program Loader Set (PLS). Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to award a sole source contract to General Digital Corporation, 8 Nutmeg Road South, South Windsor, CT 06074-3469. This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is this major component is deemed to be available from only the original source for the continued operation of the PLS system, otherwise the PLS hardware and software would have to be redesigned to communicate and interface with a new unit. It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would produce unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information from companies attenuating the sole source basis listed above. The Government is seeking companies with the capacity to provide an LCD with the necessary capability and applicable requirements or performance on other Government contracts with similar efforts.</p>
<p>Responses should include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution, as well as, whether a demonstration unit can be provided to expedite the decision making process.</p>
<p>All interested parties are encouraged to submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, production units, production quantity breaks, mitigate the reason why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above, and /or identify other Government contracts with similar efforts for the Government(s) consideration.</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number:  N00164-18-S-NB11</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM).  Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>

This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.

The suits in the Stock System that have vents installed on them do not support heat exhalation. The vents are only beneficial when used in conjunction with air-fed hoods and they allow excess air-pressure to vent so that the suits do not become over pressurized.

<DESC><strong>Request for Information (RFI)<br />New Thailand Activity</strong>
<p><strong>Reference Number</strong>: 72048618R00001<br /><strong>Release Date</strong>: October 20, 2017<br /><strong>Response Due Date</strong>: November 5, 2017 at 4.00 pm, Bangkok time</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Development Mission for Asia (USAID/RDMA), is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for an anticipated activity supporting good governance and conflict mitigation/reconciliation programming in Thailand. This anticipated activity is listed on the USAID Business Forecast as "New Thailand Activity" at https://www.usaid.gov/business-forecast. This RFI offers an opportunity for interested organizations and individuals to provide recommendations on needs and opportunities for efforts that would diminish the potential for violence and conflict both in Thailand's Deep South and nationwide. Approaches must be inclusive, integrating women, youth, and other underserved groups, into conflict-prevention activities and strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The United States and Thailand share a longstanding friendship that spans more than 180 years. Since World War II, the United States and Thailand have significantly expanded diplomatic, security, and commercial relations. An interim military government has ruled Thailand, a constitutional monarchy, since a May 2014 military coup which deposed an elected civilian government. The United States has urged the restoration of elected civilian government and return to democracy through elections. Thailand is a key U.S. security ally in Asia, and the country's stability and growth are important to the maintenance of peace in the region.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Intervention</strong><br />The proposed activity will support good governance and conflict mitigation/reconciliation programming in Thailand. The activity should build upon lessons learned through previous and existing USAID programming as well as complement ongoing bilateral engagements between the U.S. Government (USG) and Royal Thai Government (RTG).</p>
<p><strong>Information Requested<br /></strong>Specific questions on which USAID/RDMA would like to gather input include the following:</p>
<p>1. What are the key drivers of tension among different interests in Thailand, both nationwide and in the Deep South?</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. What approaches might help reduce conflict and promote peaceful resolution to the tensions identified above within the political process? Please reference any specific examples of previous efforts that have worked in the context of Thailand or comparable operating environments. Who are the key stakeholders, both potential champions and spoilers, that you would foresee to a successful governance and reconciliation activity? How might they be engaged most effectively?</p>
<p>3. How might a new activity promote meaningful inclusion of underserved groups, such as women, and youth, to contribute to a more responsive political process? Is there a role for engaging civil society organizations (CSOs), academic institutions, and government institutions in this approach?</p>
<p>Response to this RFI is voluntary. Responders are free to address any or all the above items, as well as provide additional information relevant to effectively promoting good governance and reconciliation in Thailand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Please note that USAID is not seeking technical or cost proposals at this time. Do not submit any proposal/application in response to this RFI. Only the information requested above will be considered.</em></strong></p>
<p>Issuance of this notice does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the U.S. Government, nor does it commit the Government to pay for any costs incurred in the preparations of responses.</p>
<p>How to Submit a Response<br />All comments must be submitted electronically to Suthicha Chussananalin at schussananalin@usaid.gov. Response to this RFI will be accepted through the date and time indicated above. You will only receive an electronic confirmation acknowledging receipt of your response, but will not receive individualized feedback on any suggestions. No basis for claims against the U.S. Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or from the Government's use of such information. Specific questions about this RFI should be directed only to the email addresses identified above.</p>
<p>The submitted information must not exceed 8 (eight) pages. The submitted response should include:</p>

Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond. This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their quote for capability determination or for registration in WWW.SAM.GOV . If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS item manager and engineering, vendors who believe they would otherwise qualify based on the aforementioned criteria are encouraged to contact Ms. Jennifer Eure at (252) 334-5222 for a capability evaluation and determination toward future awards consideration. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.

For this/these item(s), the sum of $TBD of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.<br />(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).<br />(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."<br />(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.<br />(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "Disputes."<br />(f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.<br />(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "Default." The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.<br />(h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."<br />(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.<br />(j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:<br />On execution of contract $TBD</p>
<p>DFARS 252.237-7014 Loss or Damage (Count-of-Articles)<br />(a) The count-of-articles will be-<br />(1) The count of the Contracting Officer; or<br />(2) The count agreed upon as a result of a joint count by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer at the time of delivery to the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall-<br />(1) Be liable for return of the number and kind of articles furnished for service under this contract; and<br />(2) Shall indemnify the Government for any loss or damage to such articles.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall pay to the Government the value of any lost or damaged property using Federal supply schedule price lists. If the property is not on these price lists, the Contracting Officer shall determine a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>(d) The Contracting Officer will allow credit for any depreciation in the value of the property at the time of loss or damage. The Contracting Officer and the Contractor shall mutually determine the amount of the allowable credit.</p>
<p>(e) Failure to agree upon the value of the property or on the amount of credit due will be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(f) In case of damage to any property that the Contracting Officer and the Contractor agree can be satisfactorily repaired, the Contractor may repair the property at its expense in a manner satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, rather than make payment under paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>
<p>DFARS 252.237-7015 Loss or Damage (Weight of Articles)<br />(a) The Contractor shall-<br />(1) Be liable for return of the articles furnished for service under this contract; and<br />(2) Indemnify the Government for any articles delivered to the Contractor for servicing under this contract that are lost or damaged, and in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, cannot be repaired satisfactorily.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall pay to the Government $14.00 per pound for lost or damaged articles. The Contractor shall pay the Government only for losses which exceed the maximum weight loss in paragraph (e) of this clause.</p>
<p>(c) Failure to agree on the amount of credit due will be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(d) In the case of damage to any articles that the Contracting Officer and the Contractor agree can be satisfactorily repaired, the Contractor shall repair the articles at its expense in a manner satisfactory to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e) The maximum weight loss allowable in servicing the laundry is 8% percent of the weight recorded on delivery tickets when the laundry is picked up. Any weight loss in excess of this amount shall be subject to the loss provisions of this clause.</p>

Market research resulted in the identification of a single approved QML-38534 Flash ADC source of supply, DATEL. Except for DATEL, the Aerospace/Defense Industry has moved away from developing high performance "Flash ADC" solutions and have opted to develop more efficient ADC architectures with higher resolution and increased sampling speeds. DATEL's ADC208A represents a near-complete part match and the device is recommended for new military designs.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>This Other Transaction Solicitation (OTS) Call (70RSAT18R00000001) - High Fidelity Counting and Measuring of CBP Queues and Service Times at Ports of Entry - is a call issued against Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T), Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), 5-Year Innovation Other Transaction Solicitation (OTS), HSHQDC-16-R-B0005 (current issue). The OTS describes the overarching program details whereas the call describes the specific problem set.<br /><br />International air travel continues to grow with over 112 million passengers entering the United States in Fiscal Year 2015 and over 119 million in Fiscal Year 2016. These travelers are entering the U.S. through hundreds of different size airports with different infrastructure limitations and facility designs. The continued growth of international travel requires U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to innovate in order to facilitate the entry of international visitors, increase tourism and foster economic growth while ensuring the highest level of security. The international travel continuum typically begins when a traveler books a ticket on an international air carrier. In addition, travelers must obtain the necessary travel documents such as a valid passport, U.S. visa, or for citizens of visa waiver eligible countries, an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) before a traveler can board an aircraft destined to the United States. Upon arrival in the United States, travelers will enter the Federal Inspection Service (FIS) areas in U.S. international airports, where a CBP officer will ensure the traveler has proper travel documents, conduct law enforcement queries, and conduct a purpose and intent interview.<br /><br />CBP does not have a method to capture passenger queue lengths and wait times for each step of the international arrivals process in the air environment in a highly precise and granular manner, with lane level fidelity. This capability gap prevents CBP from providing international travelers with highly accurate estimated wait-times upon arrival and prevents integrated services such as routing passengers to the shortest available queue. Automated counting and measuring (C&amp;M) systems can provide near real-time situational awareness to airport stakeholders about traveler wait times, traveler movement within a region of interest, and the speed of airport processes such as security checkpoints.<br /><br />This OTS call is looking for innovative solutions and techniques for counting and measuring that provide lane-level fidelity and can be deployed more broadly throughout the airport process in a more cost effective manner.

<SUBJECT>Land Border Biometric Exit Facial Recognition
<SOLNBR>70RSAT18R00000002
<CONTACT>DHS-Silicon-Valley DHS-Silicon-Valley, Email DHS-Silicon-Valley@hq.dhs.gov - Aaron H. Ford, Procuring Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-6302, Email Aaron.Ford@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>This Other Transaction Solicitation (OTS) Call (70RSAT18R00000002) - Land Border Biometric Exit Facial Recognition Verification Technologies - is issued against Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T), Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), 5-Year Innovation Other Transaction Solicitation (OTS), HSHQDC-16-R-B0005 (current issue). The OTS describes the overarching program details whereas the call describes the specific problem set.
<p><br />The implementation of a biometric exit system at U.S. Ports of Entry (POEs) along land borders remains a challenge for several reasons including, but not limited to: environmental conditions, speed of travel, and lack of infrastructure. At land-based POEs, infrastructure is a key inhibitor to track the exit of travelers using biographic or biometric data. In addition, the need for uninhibited vehicle traffic flow at land borders is perhaps the greatest challenge for land-border POEs. To avoid having travelers in vehicles stop at border crossings, which could create significant traffic delays, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is working to implement a face biometric entry-exit system in a way that poses the least impact on travel and trade. This call is looking for innovative solutions to capture facial recognition quality photos from travelers in order to facilitate identity checks without requiring occupants to leave the vehicle.</p>

<SUBJECT>Real-Time Intelligent Traveler Wayfinding

<DESC>This Other Transaction Solicitation (OTS) Call (70RSAT18R00000003) - Real Time, Intelligent Traveler Wayfinding for the Federal Inspection Station and Aviation Environment - is issued against Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T), Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), 5-Year Innovation Other Transaction Solicitation (OTS), HSHQDC-16-R-B0005 (current issue). The OTS describes the overarching program details whereas the call describes the specific problem set.<br /><br /><br />International air travel continues to grow with over 112 million passengers entering the United States in Fiscal Year 2015 and over 119 million in Fiscal Year 2016.

Upon arrival in the United States, travelers will enter the Federal Inspection Service (FIS) areas in U.S. international airports, where a CBP officer will ensure the traveler has proper travel documents, conduct law enforcement queries, and conduct a purpose and intent interview.<br /><br /><br />Due to multiple factors in the international aviation environment, such as variations in infrastructure and travelers who may be unable to interpret signage due to language or other reasons, locating the correct line within a crowded FIS after deplaning from a long international flight can be a difficult task. Further complicating this issue is a complex queue structure that is designed to assist in segmenting passengers according to a number of factors (e.g., citizenship and method of inspection processing, such as utilizing Global Entry or the Mobile Passport Control app, ESTA status, etc.). Airports are not always configured or resourced to support dynamic displays of information and/or the distribution of push notifications regarding specific zones designed to support a segment of passengers. Airports also may not have access to the information to route passengers to the correct location, for example, whether a passenger is a Trusted Traveler or not. DHS would like to facilitate wayfinding by providing travelers with real-time information on how to efficiently navigate the FIS area and receive a tailored CBP inspection process based on the traveler admissibility status.<br /><br /><br />This call is looking for innovative solutions that will ultimately lead to airport specific, real time wayfinding systems that can deliver travelers to the airport processes and services they need to reach in the most expeditious manner possible.

<DESC>Operations Division, Navigation Management Branch is requesting the SV GEORGIA - starboard main propulsion diesel engine service by an authorized Detroit Diesel Marine Dealer/Mechanic.
<p>1.	Point of Contact (POC): (Invoices/Access/Technical)</p>
<p>Jim Bodenrader:  (912) 652-6112     James.A.Bodenrader@usace.army.mil<br />Cone Bostwick/COR:  (912) 210-3580       Cone.S.Bostwick@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>2.	Location: The SV Georgia is located at the USACE Savannah District Depot on Hutchinson Island. The physical address is 99 Grand Prize of America Savannah, Ga. 31421.The contractor will be required to perform the service at this location during USACE working hours, Mon-Fri; 0630-1500.  <br /> <br />3.	Background: SV Georgia- The starboard main propulsion diesel engine was noted to have bubbles in the overflow tank for the cooling jacket water system.  Further testing revealed the cooling jacket water system pressure in excess of 14 PSI, while noting significant pressure increases with increased throttle. Normal system configuration utilizes a 7 PSI vent/vacuum cap. Suspect combustion gas/pressure is entering cooling jacket water. Contractor will inspect, diagnose, and provide repair recommendations for cause, and repair/rebuild.</p>
<p>4.	Period of Performance:  The estimated time for completion is within 28 calendar days after award date of contract. ** Coordination for access and initiation of work should be completed between the contractor and the POCs listed above with 5 calendar days after award date. **</p>
<p>5.	Requirements:  Inspect, diagnose, and provide repair recommendations. A modification to the contract may be issued based on the results of the findings, recommendations of the contractor, and approval of USACE.</p>
<p>a.	Task 1: Inspect, diagnose, and provide repair recommendations</p>
<p>6.	Engine Information:  <br />SV Georgia <br />a.	Component ID: 06R DETROIT SERIES 60 (STBD)<br />b.	Component Type: DIESEL ENGINE<br />c.	Manufacturer: MTU<br />d.	Model: SERIES 60<br />e.	Port Engine Serial Number: 	06R0767461<br />f.	Application: MARINE</p>
<p>As this is intended as a diagnose and repair service contract it is incumbent of the contractor to address any discovery of other mechanical issues that will need to be addressed, which would prevent a successful test run, in order to return the SV Georgia back into service.  USACE may modify the existing contract or issue a new separate contract solicitation to correct any discovered deficiencies or mechanical issues.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p>Q1: When does DLA determine call needed?<br />Answer:  COR/KO based on weather conditions can issue a pre-approval of Level I or III Services.  Level II services are rarely used, but an option should the need arise.  The contractor can SMS or call (preferred method) the COR up to one day prior based on weather forecasting to get pre-approval if weather conditions present the need for winter service up to the pre-approved level.</p>
<p>Q2: How quickly can the contractor deliver?<br />Answer: The contractor does not need dedicated equipment on-site.  The Statement of Work outlines the expected performance time that the awarded contractor must deliver.  The solution is Just-in-time (JIT) delivery: before the employees arrive, depart work and/or as requested (based on weather conditions).</p>

each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its

limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,

requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

This document is a modification to combined synopsis/solicitation 36C26118Q0029 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.

 The evaluation of offers received in response to the solicitation will use a tiered or cascading order of precedence.  Tiered evaluation of offers,  also known as  cascading evaluation of offers,  is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when market research is inconclusive for justifying limiting competition to small business concerns or sub-categories of small business concerns. The contracting officer  
(1) Solicits offers from both small and other than small business concerns that will be evaluated in the following tier order: 
(a) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB); 
(b) veteran-owned small business (VOSB); 
(c) all other small business concerns; 
(d) other than small business. 
(2) If an award or a sufficient number of awards cannot be made at the first tier, evaluation of offers will proceed at the next lower tier until an award or a sufficient number of awards can be made. 
 
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit. Interested persons may submit offers, and all eligible offers received prior to 1:00 PM PDT October 30th, 2017 will be considered by the Government. The NAICS code is 339113 and the size standard is 750 Employees. 
This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-89 effective, July 14, 2016.
Products shall be supplied in accordance with the specifications, terms and conditions contained herein. In addition, the following FAR and VAAR clauses will also apply. Thank you.

C.1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

Only electronic offer will be accepted. Offers are due by 1:00 PM PDT October 30h, 2017.

Alternate system submission: Offerers submitting alternate items must provide technical information sufficient for a lay person to determine acceptability. Information will not be paid for by the government nor returned to the supplying party. The information will be used to determine product acceptability. Lack of sufficient information for our staff to determine product acceptability will result in a negative determination.  Any quote will then be found nonresponsive to the solicitation and the quote will not be considered.

New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured, used/refurbished or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. No product in development shall be considered.

Authorized dealers: Experienced firms only who are authorized dealers will be considered in addition to the original equipment manufacturer. A letter from the manufacturer stating your company is an authorized dealer for the line items must be in possession by the due date and be available for submission, if requested.

FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)
  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price
and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:
  The Government will award to the lowest price, technically acceptable offeror. Brand name or equal. 
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as "bullpenners," providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.  There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Senior Assistance Advisor (SAA) will serve as USAID/OTI's representative to Special Operations Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve (SOJTF-OIR). The incumbent will work primarily at the US Army's Camp Arifjan in Kuwait where SOJTF-OIR leads USG and coalition military planning to defeat extremist organizations. USAID/OTI programs will have an important role in helping communities recover from conflict and resist extremist influence. USAID/OTI  programs must coordinate and synchronize assistance planning efforts with SOJTF-OIR in order to ensure the USG's defense and development tools are mutually supportive in degrading extremist organizations while also building the ability of local populations' to withstand a resurgence of extremist influence or control.</p>
<p>As USAID/OTI's representative to SOJTF-OIR, the SAA will (1) advise USAID/OTI, the USAID Syria Task Force, and USAID Syria programming platforms on program design in light SOJTF-OIR plans and actions inside Syria; and (2) provide USAID/OTI a representative at SOJTF-OIR that can influence military plans to lay the groundwork for USAID/OTI assistance activities that will follow in communities liberated from extremists. The incumbent will be USAID's most senior official at SOJTF-OIR and will play an important liaison role for USAID officials beyond OTI, to include the US Embassy Turkey's Syria Transition Assistance Response Team (START), the USAID Jordan's Southern Syria Assistance Platform (SSAP), and the USAID Syria Task Force based in Washington DC.   As such, the incumbent will be responsible for establishing and managing senior level relationships with US and coalition personnel from various agencies based in Kuwait, Turkey, and Jordan.</p>
<p>The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas. The work of the SAA requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. The SAA is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. The SAA is highly responsible, service-orientated, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The SAA is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of USAID.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Senior Assistance Advisor (SAA) to Special Operations Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve (SOJTF-OIR) requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The SAA is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Middle East Team Leader or his/her designee, the SAA will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>At the GS-14 level:<br />Note: Duties and responsibilities are listed in order of importance for this position</p>
<p>&bull;	Advise SOJTF-OIR during planning exercises combatting extremism to ensure U.S. government military plans take into account assistance priorities and lay the groundwork for USAID/OTI programs to help communities recover from conflict and return to normalcy;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide informed analysis and engage in weekly policy and planning discussions with senior level USAID officials in Washington, as well as with State and USAID officials on the START and SSAP platforms;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide expert recommendations and tee up policy decision points for USAID officials to ensure policies and procedures support the SOJTF-OIR mission;</p>
<p>&bull;	Understand and navigate the international interagency actors involved in operations to counter extremism, ensuring USAID/OTI has a line of communication to key influencers in the policy and planning processes. The SAA will understand who has the necessary information and authorities to facilitate USAID/OTI programming;</p>
<p>&bull;	Facilitate input and decision making at SOJTF planning exercises based on a nuanced and complex understanding of USAID/OTI program strategies, capabilities, implementation modalities, and monitoring and evaluation systems;</p>
<p>&bull;	Advise USAID program design to ensure programs support SOJTF-OIR operations and affected communities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Lead USAID/OTI efforts to solve operational problems with SOJTF-OIR and their partners in order to facilitate timely delivery of assistance;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide expert advice to the Commander of SOJTF-OIR and US Army civil affairs teams to shape US military strategic planning and potential direct service deliveries;</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent USAID Syria programs to official visitors such as Congressional delegations, staff delegations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull;	Interact regularly with the Department of State Senior Civilian and the UK Senior Advisor to coordinate civil military planning efforts with bilateral and multilateral organizations, donors and embassies;</p>
<p>&bull;	Respond to numerous Requests for Information (RFIs) from both the USAID platforms and the Syria Task Force for information critical to agency decision-making and forward planning;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns to USAID/OTI, START, SSAP, and the Syria Task Force as they relate to USAID Syria programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure USAID programs adhere to guidelines and regulations, such as sanctions and export controls against Syria and the prohibition on assistance to designated terrorist organizations and armed groups;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties related to this scope of work as determined by the supervisor and in support of USAID/OTI planning and programs.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The SAA will be supervised by the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for the Middle East or his/her designee as part of OTI's Field Programs Division.  The SAA will also work under and be responsive to the Director of SOJTF-OIR. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior level field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative directions in terms of broadly defined missions or functions. The employee will independently plan, design and carry out programs, projects, studies or other work assignments. The employee's work will be considered technically authoritative and normally accepted without significant change, and will be reviewed in terms of fulfillment of program objectives, influence on the overall program, or contribution to the advancement of the objective.</p>
<p>10.	PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS:<br />While in Kuwait, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may involve some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>WORK ENVIRONMENT:<br />While in Kuwait, the work is primarily performed in an office setting. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The AF is now evaluating the need to obtain the same A/D switch as is currently used on the MMIII, and purchasing them as replenishment spares. The AF would like to obtain information which would be applicable if it took the replenishment spares approach.&nbsp;<br />If you are interested&nbsp;in&nbsp;this new approach, please refer to FBO notice&nbsp;number FA8214-18-F-ADSS for the Arm/Disarm Switch Spares.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />2 March 2017 Change: Please note the change in NAICS&nbsp;and classification code<span>
<p style="text-align: center; margin: 6pt 0in;"><br /><br /><strong>Industry Day Announcement&nbsp;<br />Arm Disarm Switch Replacement (ADSR) Program</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Arm Disarm Switch Replacement (ADSR) Program is to replace the current design used on the Minuteman III (MM III) weapons system. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: ">The existing design, referred to as the Arm/Disarm (A/D) switch, Part Number (P/N) 7300-13, is currently used on the weapon system. The new design will be referred to as the Arm Disarm Switch (ADS). </span>The Air Force anticipates awarding two contracts for this program. The first being a combined Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract with some initial production options, and the second will be for the production of the ADS. Due to the requirements of this program, only US Department of Defense (DoD) Contractors are eligible for award of either of these contacts.</p>
<p>To obtain industry input on the program, the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Systems Directorate will be holding an industry day to obtain feedback on different aspects of the ADSR Program as well as the acquisition strategy for the EMD and Production contract. The industry day will consist of two parts. The first part will be an Air Force provided presentation regarding the basics of the program and the pre-decisional contract strategy for EMD and Production. The presentation will be followed by one-on-one sessions-see below for eligibility requirement. The purpose of the one-on-one sessions is to have an interactive discussion about the program. Interested parties are not required to attend both parts of the industry day. However, since the purpose of one-on-one sessions is to have an active discussion with industry feedback, information covered in the presentation will not be re&#8209;presented in one-on-one sessions. Therefore, parties who sign up for a one-on-one sessions are highly encouraged to attend the presentation session.</p>
<p>The Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO), industry day questions, and an industry day registration form are attached to this industry day announcement. Parties meeting the eligibility requirement (see below) may request Interface Control Drawings (ICD) and a draft specification by indicating their request on the industry day registration form<span><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: windowtext; text-underline: none">. </span></span>The Air Force is interested in receiving feedback about the contents of these documents and the acquisition. As such, industry day participants must complete answers for industry day questions and submit those answers by 20 March 2017-answers should be limited to no more than two paragraphs per question. Detailed discussions in one-on-one sessions regarding content in these documents and the acquisition would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, the Air Force is interested in understanding interested parties capabilities. One-on-one session attendees may present capability statements, but these will be limited to no more than 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Industry day will be held in Building 1575 located at:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">6006 Wardleigh Road<br />Hill Air Force Base, Utah 84056</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The presentation portion of industry day will start at 10:00 a.m. Mountain Time on 29 March 2017. One-on-one sessions will be scheduled following the presentation and may go through 30 March 2017. They will last up to one hour each depending on participation. Parties should limit the number of participants in their one-on-one sessions to seven people. The Air Force will attempt to accommodate requests for a particular time for a party's one-on-one sessions, but depending on different factors, it may not be possible to meet at a requested time.</p>
<p>Parties interested in attending industry day, should complete the attached industry day registration form, and submit it to Dan Scheer at <a href="mailto:dan.scheer@us.af.mil">dan.scheer@us.af.mil</a>. Industry day questions and answers should also be submitted to Mr. Scheer by email. Industry day registration forms and completed industry day questions must be received no later than 4:00 pm MT on 20 March 2017 (registration forms and industry day questions can be submitted at different times, but must be submitted by the deadline). Late submissions will not be considered. If an interested party has an issue with submitting the form by email or has any additional questions, please contact Mr. Scheer (contact information listed below). Once received, parties will receive information about attendance, including, if applicable, a date/time for one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p>Participants should be aware BAE Systems and LSI Inc. will be assisting the Air Force with this program, and some of its individuals will be attending the presentation portion of industry day. BAE Systems and LSI Inc. individuals may attend one-on-one sessions, but if an interested party has an issue with discussing company information, these individuals will be excused. While this precaution is in place, proprietary information should not be discussed at/during the presentation portion of industry day. Further, participants should let the Air Force know what information is proprietary and any materials provided to the Air Force should be appropriately marked. By appropriately marked, the Air Force means proprietary information is marked as such and information that is not proprietary such as logos or sayings should not be marked. Participants should review the information provided to determine whether it really is proprietary or not as over-marking can cause issues.</p>
<p>Further, the Air Force will be taking notes at one-on-one sessions, and notes of a participant's session will be provided to that participant after industry day as soon as possible. If a one-on-one participant approves the attendance of BAE Systems and LSI Inc individuals, the notes of those sessions will be seen and used by BAE Systems and LSI Inc. individuals as well as the Air Force. Other than this exception, one-on-one participant's notes will not be provided to another non-Government participant at any time. However, to ensure a fair competition, information gained from any part of industry day that is not proprietary but applicable to the acquisition/program will be provided to other participants in the form of notes on FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>Eligibility Requirement: This acquisition involves critical military technology, and some technical documents necessary for performance of this contract contain export controlled data. As such, to be eligible for award, contractors must be US DoD contractors with a DD 2345 certified by the Defense Logistics Information Service, Joint Certification Program (1-877-352-2255) and have a legitimate business purpose. <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Further, because critical military technology may be discussed during one-on-one sessions and is contained in the Interface Control Drawings as well as the draft specifications, parties must have a certified DD Form 2345 to attend the one-on-one sessions or to receive these documents. This certification is not required to attend the presentation session of Industry Day. </strong>Contractors who are not certified, but anticipate certification will be completed before 28 March 2017 can provisionally register for a one-on-one session, but if certification is not actually completed by the 28 March 2017 deadline, a one-on-one session cannot be held with that contractor. Additionally, technical documents will not be provided to a contractor until the certification is actually obtained.</p>
<p>Contractors who would like to become certified can find the form and instructions at</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://public.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/PublicHome/jcp/default.aspx">https://public.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/PublicHome/jcp/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>Interested parties are advised that certification of a DD Form 2345 may take time, so completion and submission of that form as soon as possible is highly recommended.</p>
<p>This is an industry day announcement. An industry day does not guarantee a solicitation will be released. The Air Force reserves the right to decide whether a solicitation is released and the terms of that solicitation. Further, the Air Force will not pay for costs or expenses associated with industry day or for information provided in association with industry day.</p>

Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation or solicitations are released, it will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunity (WWW.FBO.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Project Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (GCTT) is contemplating a new acquisition to increase and update the Stryker Maintenance Training System (MTS). Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) has identified the need for additional maintenance trainers to support the Stryker Additional Skill Identifier (ASI) R4 and 91S Skill Based Training courses at the Ordnance Schools located on Fort Lee, VA. Currently, the institutional Stryker 91S schools use fielded Stryker MTS such as Diagnostic and Troubleshooting Trainers (DTT), Part Task Trainers (PTT) and Hands on Trainers (HOT). These institutional trainers provide skill level development for system operation, fault diagnosis, troubleshooting, adjustments, removal and replacement and repair tasks.</p>
<p>Statement of Need:</p>
<p>Hands on Trainers (HOT)<br />The Stryker MTS shall include a training enhancement by supplying additional HOTs for particular training small groups on specific aspects of the Stryker vehicle family. The HOT device or devices will be used to train troubleshooting and basic remove and replace tasks. The HOT device(s) can also be used in the verification of repair. The HOT device(s) will provide all the functionality of the given portion of the Stryker family isolated from the total system and allow instructor induced failure to train specific tasks. These HOT maintenance trainers are required at Fort Lee to support and enhance the current training program. All maintenance training is based on the procedures contained in the Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM) and the simulation database for all Stryker MTS components must continually be upgraded to the latest IETM version. Changes to the IETM are expected every two or three years and with each new version the simulation database must be updated to match the new troubleshooting and maintenance procedures, and the changes incorporated into each of the DTTs, PTTs, and HOTs along with a hardware technical refresh. Along with the Department of Defense (DoD) mandated upgrade to the latest Windows Operating System (OS) - currently Windows 10.</p>
<p>Currently, the Fort (Ft) Lee school house includes one Hands on Trainer (HOT) for the Stryker Remote Weapon System (RWS) and five Hull HOTs. There are no HOTs for the Anti-Tank Guided Missile variant (ATGM), Mortar Carrier variant (MC) or the Mobile Gun System (MGS). Weapon system training for these variants currently utilizes tactical vehicles. Based on course loads for 91S, this requires 5 HOTs trainers each. Also, a major design change (A1) to the Stryker vehicle require changes to the current Hull HOTs (5) and additional training devices. Two of the five fielded Hull HOTs are to be upgraded to the A1 design training requirements and the other three require a technical refresh as many key components are wearing out and need updating. To support development and production of the HOTs, the Government intends to provide Government Furnished Property (GFP).</p>
<p>Below is a list of the particular HOTs to be delivered in this effort:<br /><br />Mobile Gun System (MGS) 5 systems<br />Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) 5 systems<br />Remote Weapon System (RWS) 5 systems<br />Mortar Carrier (MC) 5 systems<br />Stryker A1 Hull 2 systems (reuse 2 of 5 fielded)<br />Stryker Hull Tech Refresh 3 systems (3 remaining of 5)</p>
<p>With an anticipated delivery will be required for the following:<br />HOT MGS - First Article FY19Q4 Remaining 4: FY21<br />HOT ATGM - First Article FY20Q1 Remaining 4: FY20-FY21<br />HOT RWS - First Article FY20Q2 Remaining 4: FY20-FY21<br />HOT MC - First Article FY19Q4 Remaining 4: FY20<br />HOT A1 Stryker - First Article FY21Q2 Remaining 1: FY21</p>
<p>Part Task Trainers (PTT)<br />The MTS shall include a training enhancement by supplying additional PTTs for particular training small groups on specific aspects of the Stryker vehicle family. The PTT device or devices will be used to train troubleshooting and basic remove and replace tasks. The PTT device(s) can also be used in the verification of repair. The PTT device(s) will provide all the functionality of the given subsystem portion of the Stryker family isolated from the total system and allow instructor induced failure to train specific tasks. These PTT maintenance trainers are required at Fort Lee to support and enhance the current training program. All maintenance training is based on the procedures contained in the Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM) and the simulation database for all Stryker MTS components must continually be upgraded to the latest IETM version. Changes to the IETM are expected every two or three years and with each new version the simulation database must be updated to match the new troubleshooting and maintenance procedures, and the changes incorporated into each of the DTTs, PTTs, and HOTs along with a hardware technical refresh. Along with the Department of Defense (DoD) mandated upgrade to the latest Windows Operating System (OS) - currently Windows 10.</p>
<p>A major design change to the Stryker vehicle require two additional power pack PTTs variants and a PTT Hull C9 engine Replace and Remove. The Stryker redesign to the double-V hull included a new caterpillar C-7 engine, and a newer caterpillar C-9 engine. New PTTs are required for both the new C-7 engine used in the double-V hull design, new C-9 engine and a Hull Replace and Remove (Hull R&amp;R). To support development and production of the PTTs, the Government intends to provide Government Furnished Property (GFP). Below is a list of the particular PTTSs to be delivered in this effort:</p>
<p>C7 Engine 1 systems<br />C9 Engine 1 systems<br />C9 Engine Hull R&amp;R 1 systems</p>
<p>With an anticipated delivery will be required for the following:<br />C7 Engine - First Article FY20Q2 <br />C9 Engine - First Article FY21Q2 <br />C9 Engine Hull R&amp;R - First Article FY20Q4</p>
<p><br />PEO STRI is seeking the following information:<br />Interested offerors who possess the technical capability and resources to fulfill all or part of the Governments technical requirements stated herein are requested to respond and submit a capability statement. Questions, input or industry assistance is highly encouraged to allow the Government to refine the requirement and conduct market research.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to identify the draft evaluation factor relative to small business goals for this acquisition.<br /><br />Draft Evaluation Factor:<br /><br />Factor 6: Socio-economic Status<br />It is the policy of the Government to encourage the full participation of small businesses in the procurement process. The IRS will make awards with an evaluation preference towards small business. This preference will only be provided to prime contractors who are small businesses capable of performing at least 50% of the work under this requirement. The quoter will either obtain the preference or not based on its business status as either a small business or other than small business. Quotes from small businesses will receive an excellent rating for this evaluation factor, while other than small businesses will receive a neutral rating. Quoters must be a small business at the time of award to qualify for this preference.
<p><br />Adjectival Rating Methodology for Factor 6</p>
<p>"Excellent" - Quoter is a small business. There is no order of small business preferences, as all small businesses will be treated equally.</p>
<p>"Neutral" - Quoter is other than a small business.</p>

<p>The parent design, from which an offeror's FFG(X) solution would be developed, must have been constructed and demonstrated at sea. A "clean sheet", "paper", or developmental parent design would not qualify under this definition and would not be accepted for consideration under the Conceptual Design solicitation.</p>
<p>There is no requirement for the prime contractor to be a US shipyard for purposes of Conceptual Design. A US shipyard may participate as a part of multiple teams consistent with the prime and subcontractor restrictions outlined within the original synopsis.</p>

This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  The planned industry day will serve as a market research tool, both for informing industry of United States Government (USG) requirements for AH-1Z and UH-1Y MMRO services and for determining industrys interest, awareness and capabilities for providing those services.  The industry day forum will allow for networking among interested service providers and lead to USG awareness of industrys capabilities for supporting the AH-1Z and UH-1Y.
  FRCWP will host the Industry Day on 16-17 November 2017 at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma, Okinawa, Japan, beginning at 9:00 AM and ending at 4:00 PM each day.
FRCWP uses USG contracts with MMRO service providers to support aircraft maintenance.  In general, requirements will consist of Integrated Maintenance Plan (IMP) and In-Service Repair (ISR) Depot-Level support.  FRCWP is particularly interested in identifying potential service providers for its upcoming AH-1Z and UH-1Y IMP and ISR support requirement.  Aviation MMRO service providers will have the opportunity to learn about FRCWPs mission, to meet with contracting personnel from Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and to tour the relevant facilities on MCAS Futenma, Japan.
    If questions arise during the industry day that cannot be answered in person, those answers will be published on ASIA NECO and FEDBIZOPPS after the event.  There will be limited availability for Industry/Government one-on-one sessions on 18 November for interested service providers.  Depending on the number of companies attending, the one-on-one sessions are anticipated to be held in 60-minute intervals on the hour by appointment only.  Questions from the one-on-one sessions will NOT be published..

Advance registration for this event is required.  Parties interested in attending the industry day and the one-on-one sessions must submit a reservation request via email to Mr. Kurt Dronenburg at kurt.dronenburg@fe.navy.mil and to Mr.

<DESC>DATES: Joint Service Provider (JSP) will host a Reverse Industry Day event for JSP staff on October 25 thru 27th, 2017 at the Pentagon located in Arlington, VA.<br /><br /><br />REVERSE INDUSTRY DAY OVERVIEW:&nbsp; The draft agenda for individual vendor presentations is as follows:<br /><br />1. Introduction, Company Overview, and SDN Capability (~15-20 min)<br />2. Vendor presentation on published questions (~20-30 min)<br /><br />REVERSE INDUSTRY DAY QUESTIONS: <br /><br />1. Describe the overall architecture of your SDN controller.&nbsp; Include in your response an emphasis on how the architecture will enable you to add functionality over time; how automation/orchestration platforms (code based).<br /><br />2. What protocols do you support between the control layer and the infrastructure layer?&nbsp; If OpenFlow is supported, what versions have been implemented?&nbsp; What required features, if any, of the supported version are not included in the implementation?&nbsp; Indicate which of the optional features are supported.&nbsp; Describe any significant vendor specific extensions that have been made.&nbsp; How much of the value of your SDN architecture is derived from the extensions, and are the extensions open for other vendors for integration, interoperability, etc.<br /><br />3. Describe the extent of your management solution.&nbsp; For example, does it manage just the SDN solution you provide?&nbsp; Does the same tool also manage any traditional network components that you also provide?&nbsp; To what degree will it manage networks (SDN or traditional) that are provided by other vendors? Are the applications JITC certified?<br /><br />4. The opportunities SDN brings to security include the ability to implement network access control (NAC), authorization, DDoS attack mitigation, packet inspection, behavioral based analysis and to recognize suspicious flows at the edge of the network.&nbsp; For example, suspicious flows can be directed to a series of virtual or physical security devices for detailed inspection and mitigation.&nbsp; If a problem is detected in the network, the attack can be blocked by diverting and isolating malicious traffic.&nbsp; Describe your SDN specific security solutions that protect the SDN from intrusions and attacks.&nbsp; Describe in terms of specific use cases (e.g., how the specific SDN technology can be leveraged to identify, shorten, or thwart Advanced Persistent Threats.<br /><br />5. How does your proposed solution implement netowrk virtualization?&nbsp; Include in your answer whether overlays are used; what protocols are supported; how the tunneling control function is implemented.&nbsp; How does your solution leverage multiple hybrid cloud enviornment with multiple virtual tenant networks (VTNs), is a controller or cluster of controllers dedicated to each VTN?&nbsp; How are the VTN secured and isolated?<br /><br />SUBMISSION INFORMATION.&nbsp; No change. See original RFI.<br /><br />Answers to questions that were due by 10/11/2017 at 12:00pm Eastern Time are attached. <br /><br />Further administrative instructions are attach for those companies that have a confirmed schedule day and time by JSP.<br /><br />NO MORE QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS NOTICE MAY BE SUBMITTED.<br /><br />Phone calls regarding this notice will not be accepted.

<p>Please refer to the attached J&amp;A for more information.</p>

All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide this requirement for Financial Management support. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>If no affirmative written response is received within three (3) days after publication of this notice, a sole-source contract to EDSI, Inc. will be issued.</p>
<p>The point of contact for information regarding this notice is Roy P. Layug at roy.layug1@usmc.mil.</p>
