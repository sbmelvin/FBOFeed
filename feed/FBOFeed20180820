<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. <br /><br /><br />The Government requires a purchase of one (1) narrow linewidth Ti:Sapphire laser with external cavity doubler with integrated low noise diode pumped solid state laser pump source (SolsTiS). The system consists of:
<p>SolsTiS 5000 PSX R: Narrow linewidth Ti:Sa laser, ICE-BLOC system control electronics, chiller, pump integration kit (PIK) and Verdi V18 pump source. Specifications:<br />&bull; Power at 738 nm &gt; 4.7 W<br />&bull; Tuning range 725 - 875 nm<br />&bull; Linewidth &lt; 100 kHz measured over 100 us<br />&bull; Amplitude noise &lt; 0.075 % RMS (10 Hz to 10 MHz)<br />&bull; PSX model allows for high resolution resonator scans over &gt; 25 GHz at 780 nm</p>
<p>ECD-X Enhancement Cavity: ECD-X SHG enhancement cavity operates from 363 - 437nm. The system will include one crystal module providing tuning of up to +/- 10nm and centered at 369nm. ECD-X specifications:<br />&bull; Power output at 369 nm &gt; 1.5 W<br />&bull; Scan range &gt; 40 GHz<br />&bull; Linewidth &lt; 200 kHz measured over 100 &mu;s<br />&bull; Amplitude noise &lt; 0.15% RMS (10 Hz to 10 MHz)<br />&bull; M^2 &lt; 1.2 (typical &lt; 1.1)</p>
<p>Terascan (TS): Advanced functionality for automated, continuous, mode-hop-free, high resolution wavelength scans over 10 nm<br />&bull; Incorporates a Fixed Infra-Red Pick Off and Fiber Launch Module for stable connection to customer's wavemeter</p>
<p>Variable Infra-Red Pick-Off + Low Power Fiber Launch Module: <br />&bull; Integrated variable infra-red pick-off module for stable, safe access to SolsTiS output (~5% to 95%)<br />&bull; Low Power Fiber Launch Module</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with:</p>
<p>M Squared Lasers INC<br />1 Broadway FL. 14<br />Cambridge MA 02142-1187</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet this requirement. It is essential to have a system that offers highest specification and flexibility and offers automated, hands free operation over the wavelength region required in the Government's experiments. Also required is the ECDx frequency doubling module which is the most efficient SHG enhancement cavity available and covers 363 - 437nm with a single set of optics. The SolsTiS also offers the feature of a hermetically sealed cavity and fully hands-free, automated operation with no manual adjustment, which can complete a 5nm mode hop free, continuous scan with kHz resolution within 10 minutes. Other manufactures are unable to meet this requirement without severely impacting or jeopardizing the success of ongoing research which would result in a loss of efficiency and the ability to experiment will be impaired</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to jennifer.calandra-willson@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>FUNDS are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this contract action. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an Offeror for any costs. <br /><br /><br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 30 September 2018.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award.</p>

<p>The microwave radiometers must be technically compatible and interoperable with the existing equipment to ensure consistency and continuity in experimentation. RPG radiometers have custom internally fabricated hardware, custom firmware and software. Due to the specialized and proprietary nature of the equipment, there are no existing third party sources that possess the required technical knowledge or capability to provide the required radiometer. In order to maintain, troubleshoot and repair the RPG in house, the Government attended a training at the RPG factory in Germany. Therefore any other product is provided the Air Force would experience a substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to jennifer.calandra-willson@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 30 September 2018.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award.</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-18-01790 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13) exceptions: (i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE. (iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically. Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. A request for quote solicitation will be made through Federal Business Opportunities website and offerors will be able to respond electronically.

<DESC>NSN: 4820-01-129-3682. Item Description: Valve, Flow Control. Manufacturer's Code and Part Number: CAGE (96124) P/N 733700-3.
<p><br />Quantity: 13. Unit of Issue: EA. Destination Information: Cherry Point, NC. Delivery Schedule: 255 days.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 3 JUL 2017. The Small Business size standard is 750 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved source is: Transdigm, Inc. DBA Aero Fluid Products (96124).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and the other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of the posting of this notice.</p>
<p>Various increments solicited: 5-10, 11-15, 16-20, and 21-25.</p>

Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014) must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><strong>-------- IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT --------</strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2103.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;DoDI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DoD PKI identity certificates when accessing DoD information systems. The DoD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DoD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DoD and authenticate themselves to DoD Information Systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DoD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DoD Information Systems.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;The following are the three entities authorized by the DoD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/eca/index.html<br /><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br /><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can get the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to their hard drive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If one person logs on from different computers they should get the Medium Token Assurance which can be carried around like a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each user will need their own (like our CAC card).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each person who needs to access the system will need one.</p>

See the attached list of descriptions and part numbers. There will be a trade-in of a 20-year-old Leica SP5 Confocal Microscope, serial #5100000168. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items an award will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13.501(a)(1).
<p><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm-fixed price type of contract.</p>
<p>Delivery to Rockville, Maryland 20852 approximately 120 days after receipt and acceptance of award.</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Malaria and Vector Research (LMVR) has a requirement for a Leica SP8 X Confocal Microscope System with 7 Channel White Light Laser Falcon FILM and Lighting System will fulfill the research needs for various projects at the LMVR. The main objective is the lifecycle replacement of a 20-year-old Leica SP5 Confocal Microscope. This new instrument guarantees higher speed collection that is fundamental for living imaging which is fundamental for many of the proposed projects. The scanning unit will run at much higher speed and this will expand the spectrum of user needs that up to now could not be covered with the current outdated instrument. This new instrument will have a better light sensitivity than the existing SP5 confocal microscope, particularly in weak signal samples, which is currently a limiting factor at the LMVR. Importantly, this instrument needs very little excitation power, which is critical to preserve live samples. This new unit will have on board deconvolution software which gives real time deconvolved images saving an immensurable amount of time on post-acquisition processing of images. Also, this system will have increased effective resolution that will reach 120-130 nm. This new instrument has a 690 nm laser which allows the use of probes in the near infra-red spectrum. Leica Microsystems Inc., is the only vendor to provide the SP8 X Confocal Microscope System with 7 Channel White Light Laser Falcon FILM and Lighting System that is compatible with the aging SP5. There will be a trade-in of the SP5 Confocal Microscope, with the components of TMC Air Table, Super Z Galvo Stage and Inserts/Incubation, Specialty Objectives, 2 HyD Detectors and XY Scanning Stage that will be configured to the SP8. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. All responsible sources who can provide the same or similar equipment may submit a capability statement that could be considered by email (subject line to reference NIAID-NOI-18-1920139) to Tonia Alexander at talexander@niaid.nih.gov, by 1:00 pm eastern standard time Monday, August 27, 2018.&nbsp;All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. All responses received by the closing date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) anticipates soliciting quotations and subsequently awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price contract for Therapy Equipment for the VA Northern California Health Care System (VANCHCS).  Acquisition of these items is part of the initial outfitting and activation of the new Chico VA Clinic in Chico, CA.

DESCRIPTION
A contract is needed for the Chico VA Clinic for below listed brand name or equal equipment.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS/MANUFACTURERS CUTSHEETS
The contractor will be required to include manufacturer cut-sheets/specifications for items quoted.

**See attached STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)


ADMINISTRATIVE
The solicitation will be issued as a  Request for Quote  (RFQ) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13. The solicitation will be advertised as set-aside for Small Business.  The applicable NAICS code is 339112.  The solicitation will be issued on or about August 23, 2018 for approximately seven (7) calendar days.  Offerors will be required to submit their quotes electronically via email. 

Products that are purchased outside of our authorized distributor network on the gray market generate a number of concerns such as: counterfeit or adulterated devices, inadequate storage conditions, tracking issues in case of a recall, loss of warrantee, and most importantly patient safety. In some instances unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. However, authorized distributors purchase products at list price, and the unauthorized distributors are reselling the product at a price point below list price, which raises questions about product sourcing.

The solicitation will include the requirement that responders provide an authorized distributor letter that states the responder is an authorized dealer/distributor of the OEM for the items being procured such that all product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the responder to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  Vendors who are unable to supply proof of authorized dealer or distributorship will not be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for competitive offers.  Questions of a technical nature will not be answered as part of this notice; however, all general questions may be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email at jacquelyn.wise@va.gov AND michelle.rhodes@va.gov.   Telephone calls will not be accepted.  The VA reserves the right to use only Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), via the internet, to provide notification of any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.  It is the contractor s responsibility to view FBO daily for any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.

<p>The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement, if a requirement materializes. Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding submissions.</p>
<p><br />DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) TO BE SUBMITTED. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>JMTC-RIA is attempting to create a metal and polymer Additive Manufacturing Cell to support various DoD programs in Building 250 at RIA. This project will provide an Argon and Nitrogen gas storage and distribution system for Building 250 to support the new additive manufacturing cell.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>The Government requires a bulk gas storage and distribution system. The intent of this Sources Sought is to assess the state-of-the art of the technology available in Argon and Nitrogen gas storage and distribution systems and products that could be applied to meet this requirement.</p>
<p>The Government envisions a solution for bulk gas storage and distribution that meets the following operational and program requirements: The contractor shall provide and install all equipment needed for a gas storage and distribution system for a metal additive manufacturing cell. Two medium pressure gas storage tanks (Perma-Cyl 5,500 or equivalent) shall have at least 5,500 liters in size (one for Argon, and the other tank for nitrogen). Gas capacity of each tank shall be at least 156,000 Standard cubic foot of Argon, and 128,000 standard square feet of Nitrogen. Distribution lines (qty 2), from the storage tanks shall be stainless steel with swage fittings, and .75 dia. The (2) distribution lines will connect from the (2) storage tanks, to (2) distribution loops around the additive manufacturing machine area (which will also be swaged stainless steel (.75 diameter). Quantity (20) Independent legs will come off each distribution loop (.5 diameter, stainless steel) travelling down columns to valve shut offs at the machine level.</p>
<p>Qualification.

To maintain optimal performance, safety, and functionality of the furnace this thermocouple assembly, which has certain proprietary design features, must be compatible with the existing vacuum induction melt furnace.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement.  
 
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 4:00 PM ET on September 4, 2018.  Responses must be submitted in writing to the purchasing agent, Lora Stumpf, via email at stumpf@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above.

<DESC><p>I. SUMMARY</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes (FAR 15.201(e)) as part of a market survey led by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and the PMA-202 Aircrew Systems, PMA-265 F/A-18 and EA-18G, and PMA-273 Undergraduate Flight Training School program offices. This is NOT a Request for Proposals. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>NAVAIR desires a platform independent physiological monitoring/alerting system qualified for use in a Naval Aviation Environment that can provide real-time information about aviator physiologic and cognitive status in flight. The organization that provides this capability must be able to develop and rapidly field a technology solution that provides a reliable method for detecting / predicting and alerting the aircrew of an impending physiological event (e.g., hypoxia, hypercapnia, decompression sickness, etc.) that may result in degradation of psychomotor performance so that aircrew can take timely corrective action.</p>
<p>The organization must be familiar with / able to:</p>
<p>&bull; Understand tactical military aviation environment (i.e., flight support equipment and clothing, environmental stresses, tempo, physical constraints/demands, etc.)<br />&bull; Physiological monitoring / alert system must be compatible with current tactical military aviation environment<br />&bull; Aeromedical needs and capabilities, human element and physiology<br />&bull; Provide a physiological monitoring / alerting system that provides insight into cognitive status<br />&bull; The organization must also possess an advanced/detailed understanding of the physiological monitoring / alerting system hardware and software to support timely correction of deficiencies identified during test or after the system is fielded.</p>
<p>NAVAIR requests that interested organizations submit a white paper including a capabilities statement to NAVAIR Contracts (AIR 2.5.1.15). (See instructions in Section III) (RFI responses due 30 April 2018 @1600 EST)</p>
<p>II. DATA PROTECTION</p>
<p>This RFI is an exchange of information between Government and Industry. It is the first step of an iterative process aimed at understanding the existence of sources that can deliver solutions to the capabilities described herein. Additional RFIs requesting further detail may be issued in the future to continue the Government's informational exchange with Industry. Information received as a result of this request is expected to be sensitive and/or proprietary to the responding company and will be protected as such. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosures; however, it is incumbent upon the respondent to appropriately mark all submissions. In order to complete its review, NAVAIR must be able to share the information within the Government and any responses marked in a manner that will not permit such internal Government review may be returned without being assessed or considered.</p>
<p><br />III. INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and planning ONLY, and does not constitute a solicitation.&nbsp; See the attachment for RFI information and instructions.</p>
<p align="left">The United States is experiencing a shortage of truck drivers ("trucker shortage"), with some experts estimating that tens of thousands additional truckers would be needed to fully meet the nation's current transportation demands. Recent articles on this phenomenon have identified several key factors behind its shortage, including the willingness of younger workers to become truckers, the surge of e-commerce, and the public's evolving expectations for the speed of shipping. As this trucker shortage intensifies, it is likely to have significant effects on the U.S. economy, perhaps especially so for all actors along the shipping and delivery supply chain.</p>
<p align="left">The USPS OIG is interested in research on the trucker shortage and its potential implications for the U.S. Postal Service.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects. The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'. Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>The Open Period for SEPTEMBER* is SEPTEMBER 1, 2018 to SEPTEMBER 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement. The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements. Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov). Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately. During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG01 and must be located within Region 1 (New England).</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM: Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>*If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

2.  Contract Title.  Two Ea (2) Lumify Point-Of-Care Ultrasound Combo Packages.
3.  Background.  
In the past 20 years there has been growth in the body of evidence that demonstrates the utility of Point-Of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS).  The best evidence for beneficial safety and patient outcomes relates to the use of POCUS for bedside procedures.  POCUS also has many different applications for patient assessment that can enhance and complement the traditional physical examination and therefore aid in the diagnosis and clinical decision making.  
4.  Scope. 
POCUS is highly sensitive for pneumothorax consistently outperforming chest x-ray by a wide margin.  POCUS has been shown to be highly valuable in the assessment of acute dyspnea.  POCUS consistently outperforms standard physical examination and the chest x-ray in the detection of pleural effusions.  Furthermore, POCUS enables the physician to characterize the nature of the effusion as simple or complex in real time.  

Many of the residency programs teach POCUS to assess the central venous pressure (CVP) of patients more than any other POCUS application.  They do so primarily through visualization of the inferior vena cava (IVC).  CVP is estimated based on the size of the IVC as well as its collapsibility with respiration.  This enables the physician to determine whether the patient may need additional fluids or be in fluid overload.  Being able to identify this at bedside saves much need time in making the appropriate determination and corrective measure which improves patient care.

<DESC>Pursuant to (FAR) 13.501(a). The National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to procure professional services in support of Organization Technical Committee 229 (ISO/TC 229) Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Working Group. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) coordinates the development of voluntary consensus standards in the United States and has represented the needs and views of U.S. stakeholders in standardization fora around the globe. ANSI is the U.S. member body to ISO and, via its U.S. National Committee, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). ANSI administers the U.S. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for ISO/TC 229 Nanotechnologies. The scope is standardization in the field of nanotechnologies that includes either or both of the following:
<p>&bull;	Understanding and control of matter and processes at the nanoscale, typically, but not exclusively, below 100 nanometers in one or more dimensions where the onset of size-dependent phenomena usually enables novel applications.</p>
<p>&bull;	Utilizing the properties of nanoscale materials that differ from the properties of individual atoms, molecules, and bulk matter to create improved materials, devices, and systems that exploit these new properties.</p>
<p>ANSI has had the role of administrator for ISO/TC229 TAG Working Group 3 for more than 10 years and, as a result, has acquired unique expertise and background in the administration of this working group. There are no other organizations within the U.S. that have the same expertise and background in this area.</p>
<p>In addition to this order, the funding will cover specific tasks to include developing standards for: terminology and nomenclature; metrology and instrumentation, including specifications for reference materials; test methodologies; modelling and simulations; and science-based health, safety, and environmental practices.</p>
<p>The period of performance is September 1, 2018 through August 31, 2019; with (4) one-year option periods.</p>
<p>The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This synopsis is for informational purposes only</p>

<DESC>The AGDISP model is widely used to understand and regulate pesticide drift with the original AGDISP model focused on aerial application. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are becoming a larger part of aerial application and are the primary platforms for this work in many parts of the world. Spray deposition and drift from UAS is not adequately described, in many cases, by the algorithms currently in AGDISP, thus requiring a different approach to this modeling. Recent work has shown success in modeling pesticide deposition and drift from UAVs but substantial work is required to develop an aircraft library and put a new approach into the AGDISP platform. The successful contractor must have intimate familiarity with the AGDISP source code and experience in coding onto the AGDISP platform. The work will be to use existing modelled wake descriptions to develop an approach to include in AGDISP and add more wake configurations to the library if possible given the resources at hand.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT
The Department of Veteran Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Network Contracting Office 6, Hampton VA 23667, intends to negotiate a sole source, Firm-Fixed Price contract for Sonosim Training Modules on behalf of the Richmond VAMC with Sonosim Inc., in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as implemented by FAR 8.405-6(b). This is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation is available. Market research has determined that the requested items are highly specialized, are only available from a single source without an unacceptable delay or duplication of cost and no other type of item will satisfy the agency requirements. The Government intends to award the contract with an effective date of 8 August 2018 to Sonosim Inc., 1738 Berkeley St Ste A, Santa Monica, CA 90404-4105. Cage Code 6JVL9.

This is a Brand-Name Only requirement to satisfy the request from the Richmond VAMC Training and Simulation Program. The requiring activity requested additional Sonosim training modules to meet their current training requirements. The medical center has a preestablished inventory with Sonosim modules, training equipment and software. Procuring any other simulation device would undermine the previous standardization efforts previously executed to comply with the SOP established for the Richmond VAMC training requirements and standards. Awarding to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency s requirements. This synopsis announcement is being issued for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or request for competitive proposals. If a firm believes it is capable of meeting the Government's requirement, it may identify its interest and capability to the contracting officer within three (2) calendar days of this publication by contacting Desiree Mills via e-mail at desiree.mills-hicks@va.gov, Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. This announcement closes 22 August 2018 at 12:00 noon Eastern Standard Time. Those interested firms must indicate whether they are a large, small, small-disadvantaged, 8(a) or woman owned business and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned. Respondents who submit proprietary data shall clearly mark the data with appropriate markings. The Government will not pay for any information submitted as a result of this synopsis. This synopsis shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or items.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Background</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">:</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Additive manufacturing (AM) fabrication methods are proliferating rapidly, with photopolymer-based approaches comprising some of the most prominent methods. These stereolithographic techniques provide a useful balance of resolution, build speed, process control, and capital cost (system metrics that typically must be traded off one against another). Resolving the speed limitations, surface roughness (stair-step artifacts), and requirements for support structures would provide the next major steps forward in the progress of these technologies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Description</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">LLNL has developed a system and method that accomplishes volumetric fabrication by applying computed tomography (CT) techniques in reverse, fabricating structures by exposing a photopolymer resin volume from multiple angles, updating the light field at each angle. The necessary light fields are spatially and/or temporally multiplexed, such that their summed energy dose in a target resin volume crosslinks the resin into a user-defined geometry. These light-fields may be static or dynamic and may be generated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) that controls either the phase or the amplitude of a light field (or both) to provide the necessary intensity distribution.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Advantages</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">LLNL&rsquo;s approach surpasses recently-reported volumetric aperiodic three-dimensional (3D) structure fabrication using holographic light fields in its geometric flexibility. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Similarly, the inherently volume-based approach of the present invention provides an order-of-magnitude improvement in fabrication speed over conventional layer-by-layer "2 1/2D" printing techniques. Finally, the surface roughness problems imposed by layer-by-layer fabrication are substantially reduced if not removed entirely.</span><br /><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Past and current use has included improvement to photopolymer-based additive manufacturing:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">c. Reduction of geometric constraints that arise from 2D layer slicing, simplified post-processing</span></p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>NOAA's Marine Operations Center, Acquisition, Accountability, and Analysis Branch, negotiated on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with AML Oceanographic's sole US distributor Subsea Technologies, 1323 Price Plaza Katy, Texas 77449-3723 for the replacement of the tow body and associated parts for the MVP200 system on the NOAA Ship Fairweather.  The Moving Vessel Profiler MVP-200 System is an in-situ sound velocity profiling system used during hydrographic survey missions to periodically collect and update the sound velocity profile applied to Multibeam Echo Sounding Sonar Systems used during hydrographic survey operations. The water column temperatures can vary significantly during periods of operations causing erratic acoustic system performance and reduced accuracy of the collected hydrographic survey data. The MVP-200 system can be deployed to conduct a water column sound velocity profile while the ship is underway, reducing the time it takes to update the sound velocity data applied to the sonar system if the ship had to stop survey operations to perform a stationary manual water column profile.</p>
<p><br />The sole source determination is based on the requirement of the Fairweather to have a functional MVP to meet mission requirements. AML Oceanographic is the OEM for this equipment and has only one US distributor (Subsea Technologies), and is the only company capable of providing the parts and service that will guarantee proper operation and meet warranty requirements.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment or service that fully meets the Government's future requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct future procurements on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

This announcement is not for development purposes. Any duplication of costs for development will be at the contractor's expense.<br /><br /></div>
<div>This Sources Sought Synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in the Market Survey will NOT be reimbursed.

Your interest in this response is appreciated.<br /><br /></div>
<div>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement for a portable radio frequency simulation subsystem, single channel pulseman with mmW, also referred to as a Combat Electromagnetic Environment Simulator (CEESIM). The CEESIM system is needed to perform end to end system testing of the AN/SLQ-57 and AN/SLD-4 systems for the   validation of threat libraries and electronic attack data files. NSWC Crane Division intends to award a C type contract to Amherst Systems, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman Corporation, 1740 Wehrle Drive, Buffalo, NY, 14221 to satisfy this requirement. This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with (IAW) the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the lack of sufficient technical data, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. <br /><br /></div>
<div>It has been determined that Rockwell Collins, Inc., is the only source capable of meeting this requirement. The POC is Ms. Lynn Masterson-Brinegar, Code 0243, building 121, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5000. Telephone number is 812-854-8865 or email at lynn.masterson-brine@navy.mil. Reference the above notice number when responding to this notice.

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services (EMSS) Gateway Facility requires maintenance support of the Gateway's integrated fire alarm, fire suppression and security systems at NCTAMS PAC, Wahiawa, HI and security system equipment in Hawaii and at the DFLT.

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Johnson Controls is the only company authorized, trained, and certified to work on SimplexGrinnell proprietary software.

Although other vendors can provide selected installation services, they do not have factory-authorized access to perform work on the existing Simplex Grinnell system. Due to the critical nature of the services provided to the Warfighter, it is imperative that the Gateway be functional 24/7. Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP technicians are thoroughly familiar with the unique features of the systems that affect the safety and security of the Gateway and its occupants and are able to respond to all emergency situations and fix all problems. </span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) intends to purchase an autosampler bundle, accessories, and control driver for a current in house gas chromatograph on a sole source basis from Agilent Technologies, Inc. upon the authority provided at FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i).
<p>ERDC-CERL requires an Agilent PAL3 GC autosampler which is an accessory that fits onto the front end injection port of our in-house Agilent GC/MS. It drastically expands the capabilities of our Chemistry Laboratory, enhances the reproducibility of sample handling and on-line reactions, and increases the sample capacity for analysis. The PAL can perform liquid injections as is typical for liquid-liquid extractions, it can perform headspace gas injections from on board heated samples, and it can perform solid phase microextraction (SPME) injections from fibers that have extracted field samples. Further, it can perform numerous sample preparation and manipulation steps autonomously and reproducibly including solvent and reactant additions, mixing and agitation, dilutions and derivatizations, and multiple volume injections. The ability to rapidly and autonomously perform these steps means that our research can rapidly progress through the wide characterization space for perfect analysis. Finally, the robotic arm introduces far less error at every step than our manual handling routines, giving us far better confidence in exacting research.</p>
<p>Only Agilent makes this robotic autosampler with the robustness and capabilities for liquid, gas, and SPME injections. We note these benefits since our research routinely involves nanoscale chemistries, reactions at ultrasmall volumes, and complex biological samples. This accessory augments our GC instrument that is critical for 6.2 programs, our reimbursable projects, as well as all of our 6.1 projects.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516, which has a size standard of 1,000 employees. This is not a small business set aside, as this Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Any interested party that believes they can fulfill this requirement should submit a capability statement to be reviewed. All submissions will be considered, however there is no guarantee that submissions in response to this notice will in any way alter the Government's acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>This requirement includes the following:<br />&bull; PAL3 RSI 85 GC Autosampler bundle for current in-house Agilent gas chromatograph instrument. Contains the following:<br />o 85cm rail<br />o 1x D7/57 Liq tool<br />o Terminal<br />o Power and cables<br />o 1x tray holder<br />o 3x VT54 Rack<br />o 1x standard wash module</p>

<SUBJECT>Air Force Life Cycle Management Center - Consortium Initiative (ACI)
<SOLNBR>FA8604-19-R-4050
<RESPDATE>100118
<CONTACT>Kari Wedemeyer, Agreements Officer, Email kari.wedemeyer@us.af.mil
<DESC><p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">1. OVERVIEW</span></p>
<p>(a) The purpose of this announcement is to solicit qualified offerors to submit proposals for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center - Consortium Initiative (ACI). ACI aims to enable the Air Force to acquire prototypes at the pace of commercial innovation, from the widest possible pool of prospective suppliers. To achieve this aim, the Government is exploring options regarding competitive award of a 10 U.S.C. &sect;2371b other transaction (OT) agreement to a consortium manager to create a new or leverage an existing consortium of large and small organizations, representing traditional and non-traditional Defense contractors, as well as academic institutions. Other Department of Defense organizations may utilize this OT agreement. The consortium manager must have the ability to manage competition, award, and administration of individual prototype projects with substantial participation from nontraditional defense contractors. The mission of the consortium will include performing research, development, and test and evaluation within prototyping projects that address requirements presented by, or of interest to, the US Government.</p>
<p>(b) It is the Government's intention to enter into an OT agreement with only one consortium manager that can best meet the Government's defined scope provided below. By definition, a consortium is an organized group of entities that agree to participate under a common rule set. The consortium should be open to new membership and display a broad array of expertise and experience connected to the domains identified herein. Prospective members must agree to the terms of the consortium. A consortium comprised of educational, nonprofit, and commercial organizations with broad and open membership is required to provide the Government a partner able to collaborate across barriers that include military/civilian, public/private, local/regional/national, and political/jurisdictional matters and concerns.</p>
<p>(c) The Consortium Manager can be an individual, a for profit organization, or a not-for-profit corporation. The consortium manager will serve as an independent agent of the Government and will not be eligible to compete for project awards. The consortium manager will serve as the broker for the individual prototype project agreements. In other words, the Government sends the funds to the consortium manager; the consortium manager takes the appropriate fee for service per the terms set forth in the consortium OT agreement; and the consortium manager then delivers the remaining funds to the performers per the terms of the project transaction.</p>
<p>(d) The Government anticipates that ACI will be awarded as an Other Transaction (OT) Agreement for Prototype Projects, as authorized under 10 U.S.C. &sect;2371b. The resulting agreement is expected to be valued at a maximum funding ceiling of $100M, with a performance period of one year base period of performance with four, one-year options (for a total of five years). Note: this ceiling is likely to grow to $500M or higher. It is anticipated that this OT agreement will be funded on a Firm Fixed Price basis, in increments, with pricing based on the outcome of an indefinite number of individual prototype project-level competitions and individual prototype project agreements. Despite the Firm Fixed Price nature of the Agreement, the consortium manager will need to identify an accounting system that is capable of tracking the receipt of Government funding and the resolution of milestone payments.</p>
<p>(e) Deliverables are expected to consist nearly entirely of prototypes (software, hardware, and/or technical documentation). Periodic reports will be required for the overall program.</p>
<p>2. SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>(a) The United States Air Force has identified the need for an AFLCMC OT Consortium to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the military aviation acquisition process. This consortium would perform critical research, development, test, and evaluation within prototyping projects supporting the AFLCMC mission areas identified within Section 2(b) below. The core objective of ACI is to create a mutually beneficial environment between the Government and industry/academia that fosters collaboration to close the gap between existing technology/capability and performance threshold requirements within the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center's (AFLCMC's) mission sets detailed in section 2(b) below.</p>
<p>(b) The scope of AFLCMC prototyping projects might include any topic generally consistent with the research, development, test and evaluation within prototyping projects of the AFLCMC mission sets. These mission sets include, but are not limited to: weapon system and commercial derivative aircraft platforms; battle management; simulators; human systems; clothing/uniforms; business enterprise systems; command, control, communications, intelligence and networks; armament, support equipment and vehicles; automatic test systems; electronic warfare and avionics; information, surveillance, reconnaissance and special operations; aircraft integration, and aircraft subsystems. It is anticipated that ACI will promote competition for individual prototype projects through a two-step white paper/proposal process.</p>
<p>(c) AFLCMC aims to take advantage of the inherent flexibility afforded by other transactions for prototyping authority to achieve the following general objectives.<br />&bull; Expose AFLCMC requirements to, and lower barriers to entry for, the broad community of traditional and nontraditional solution providers.<br />&bull; Encourage rapid solicitation to award timelines.<br />&bull; Employ objective, test-based, Validation and Verification as basis of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), trade analysis, source selection, and performance monitoring.<br />&bull; Develop Intellectual Property Regimes (IPR) and Data Rights that incentivize mutually beneficial government-industry partnership.<br />&bull; Transition successfully tested prototype applications as vendor-supported off-the-shelf products.<br />&bull; Continuously evolve an appropriately "open" technical architecture that optimizes government investment by both leveraging best available existing commercial technology and developing new technology in partnership with industry.<br />&bull; Minimize risk of technology perishability by executing rapid, iterative, evolutionary, demonstration-to-delivery cycles.</p>
<p>3. LIMITATIONS OF OT AUTHORITY</p>
<p>(a) Individual project-level agreements issued under the resulting OT Agreement must be limited to prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense, or improvements to the platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces.</p>
<p>(b) To the maximum extent practicable, the individual prototype projects shall be awarded on a competitive basis, in order to provide for the opportunity to award a follow-on prototype agreement or follow-on production contract or transaction to the participants in the individual prototype projects. Further, the individual prototype projects may provide for prototypes or follow-on production items to be provided to another contractor as Government-furnished equipment.</p>
<p>(c) At least one third of the total cost of each prototype project is to be paid out of funds provided by sources other than the Federal Government unless one of the following applies:</p>
<p>a. There is at least one nontraditional defense contractor or nonprofit research institution participating to a significant extent in the prototype project;</p>
<p>b. All significant participants in the transaction other than the Federal Government are small businesses (including small business participating in a program described under section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638)); or</p>
<p>c. The senior procurement executive for the agency determines in writing that exceptional circumstances justify the use of a transaction that provides for innovative business arrangements or structures that would not be feasible or appropriate under a contract, or would provide an opportunity to expand the defense supply base in a manner that would not be practical or feasible under a contract.</p>
<p>(d) For purposes of these limitations identified in Sections 3(a)-3(c) above, the following definitions apply:</p>
<p>&bull; Prototype Project / Individual Prototype Project - A prototype project can generally be described as a preliminary pilot, test, evaluation, demonstration, or agile development activity used to evaluate the technical or manufacturing feasibility or military utility of a technology, process, concept, end item, effect, or other discrete feature. Prototype projects may include systems, subsystems, components, materials, methodology, technology, or processes. A prototype project may involve a: proof of concept; a pilot; a novel application of commercial technologies for defense purposes; a creation, design, development, demonstration of technical or operational utility; or combinations of the foregoing, related to a prototype. <br />&bull; Small Business - a small business concern as defined under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This definition also includes small businesses participating in a program described under section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638), e.g., Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program participants.</p>
<p>&bull; "Directly relevant to enhancing military capabilities" - development that enhances mission effectiveness of military personnel and supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense, or improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>&bull; Nontraditional Defense Contractor - any entity that is not currently performing and has not performed, for at least one year preceding solicitation of this agreement, any contract or subcontract subject to the full Cost Accounting Standards coverage required by 41 U.S.C. &sect; 1502.</p>
<p>&bull; "Participating to a significant extent" - supplying new key technology or products; accomplishing a significant amount of the effort; causing a material reduction in the cost or schedule, and/or causing an increase in the performance of the work effort. In order to be relieved of the one third cost share requirement, the prime traditional contractor must submit documentation describing the significant participation of the nontraditional contractor, which must be approved by the cognizant Agreements Officer.</p>
<p>4. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>(a) Interested parties are requested to respond to this combined synopsis/solicitation with a proposal.</p>
<p>(b) Proposals in Microsoft Word for Office compatible format are due no later than 1 October 2018, 1700 EST. Submissions are limited to 20 pages. Any supporting information, such as Consortium Membership Agreements, Letters of Intent, etc., must be included in the addendum (the addendum does not count against the 20-page submission limit). Responses shall be limited to 20 pages and submitted via email only to the Agreements Officer, Kari Wedemeyer at kari.wedemeyer@us.af.mil no later than 1 October 2018, 1700 EST. Any proposals received after this date and time will not be evaluated. As a practical matter, existing consortia that submit proposals must be represented by consortium managers with means and authority to speak for the members, organize their activities, and make binding agreements on their behalf.</p>
<p>(c) For standardization purposes, each proposal shall include relevant information in the following format:<br />(i) Section 1:<br />Administrative information, to include the following as a minimum: <br />1. A cover page labeled with the heading, "Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) -Consortium Initiative," name of company, name of corporate point of contact (POC), name of technical POC, telephone number for each POC, mailing address, email addresses for each POC, CAGE code, and any other pertinent information.</p>
<p>2. Business type for the offeror.</p>
<p>a. Business types may be: non-profit, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business.<br />b. Business types shall be based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.</p>
<p>3. The facility security clearance of the offeror, to include capability to handle classified material up to and including SECRET.</p>
<p>4. Proposed process for handling sensitive materials (FOUO, proprietary, etc.).</p>
<p>(ii) Section 2<br />Performance Management/Technical information, to include the following:<br />1. How the objectives would be addressed and performance against objectives would be measured. Provide evidence of ability to meet government objectives by:</p>
<p>a. Recommending a competitive process and operational procedures for handling requests for individual prototype projects. This should include procedures for handling white papers, full proposals, and projects that are determined to have merit, but for which no funding is available.</p>
<p>b. Performing fiduciary tasks associated with transferring funds from government to individual prototype project participants.</p>
<p>c. Performing targeted recruiting of new individual prototype project participants.</p>
<p>d. Facilitating teaming among individual prototype project participants.</p>
<p>e. Providing services associated with domain technological expertise such as:<br />i. Independent Validation and Verification<br />ii. Capturing and documenting standards and best practices<br />iii. Performing training<br />iv. Facilitating technical exchange</p>
<p>f. Supporting and managing consortium communications in the following manner:<br />i. Providing a centralized capability, such as a website, containing and organizing the consortium's information for easy access by US Government customers<br />ii. Providing US Government customers with prototyping resources and important OT information<br />iii. Providing secure data portal capable of transferring and storing FOUO and proprietary information<br />iv. Providing membership information (i.e., member listing and contact information)</p>
<p>g. Suggesting innovative fee structures designed to incentivize achievement of government objectives. It is anticipated that the consortium will operate on a fee-for-service basis. Examples include, but are not limited to:<br />i. Fixed transaction fee (same fee regardless of individual prototype project price)<br />ii. Tiered transaction fees (fees vary for individual prototype projects that fall within different price ranges) based on individual prototype project price, and/or services rendered, adjusted to exclude hardware, material, and travel costs. Note: The exclusion of hardware, materials, and travel costs from the fee calculation is intended to capture labor costs as the main indicator of risk in a given project, which may lead to more challenging management during the performance of a given project. Individual prototype projects that consist in large part of material, hardware, and/or travel are perceived to be less risky and require less potential for substantial involvement on the part of the consortium lead.<br />iii. Percentage of price up to a maximum dollar amount based on project price adjusted to exclude hardware, materials, and travel costs<br />iv. Percentage of project price up to a maximum dollar amount</p>
<p>h. Providing corporate competencies and past performance with respect to Government objectives and selection criteria. Explain experience with regard to consortium management in context with government and/or commercial applications.</p>
<p>i. Describing experience working on projects with the Federal Government, State and Local Governments, academia, and/or industry. Include affiliations, associations, and specific involvement in and with the federal and non-federal research and development, testing and engineering community, sufficient to demonstrate a well-established presence in that community.</p>
<p>j. Providing a proposed schedule for consortium establishment, if one does not currently exist.</p>
<p>(iii) Addendum<br />The Addendum to the proposal will not be included in the page count. The addendum shall be comprised of a proposed consortium charter that includes:<br />a. Proposed Consortium by-laws;</p>
<p>b. Proposed Consortium membership process;</p>
<p>c. Proposed consortium membership fees; and</p>
<p>d. Proposed consortium membership requirements</p>
<p>5. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>(a) The government will perform an integrated assessment of each proposal to make a final determination of which consortium provides the best value to the Government. For evaluation purposes, the following criteria will be assessed, in no relative order of importance:</p>
<p>&bull; Factor 1: Strategy for attracting, retaining, and expanding consortium membership. The Government will evaluate the consortium manager's strategy as it relates to the openness of the consortium, in particular the ease with which new members are able to join and participate; specific actions intended to expedite formation of the consortium; specific actions intended to ensure the consortium membership aligns with the mission areas identified above; and plans to grow and mature the consortium membership base.</p>
<p>&bull; Factor 2: Strategy for coordinating and assisting activities of consortium members at the individual prototype project level. The Government will evaluate the consortium's strategy as it relates to the processes by which the consortium will assist the project-level member with proposal preparation, proposal analysis, co-development and integration, test and evaluation, progress reporting, invoicing and expedited payments, intellectual property, and project close-out.</p>
<p>&bull; Factor 3: Schedule for the consortium to be established. The Government will evaluate the proposed consortium implementation plan and timeline to determine when the consortium will be capable of competing Government prototype requirements. The Government intends to solicit for individual prototype projects upon execution of the consortium OT agreement.</p>
<p>&bull; Factor 4: Recommended competition processes and operational procedures. The Government will evaluate the proposed competition process and operational procedures for prototype projects that the consortium believes is the best fit for the consortium OT agreement.</p>
<p>&bull; Factor 5: Organizational and fee structure of the consortium. The Government will evaluate the proposed organizational and fee structure of the consortium, to include Consortium Metrics, Management Framework of Consortium, Reporting, Articles of Collaboration/By-Laws, Consortium Member Agreement, innovative fee structures designed to incentivize achievement of government objectives, and any other relative information on how the consortium intends to operate. A consortium managed by a Consortium Management Firm is preferred.</p>
<p>6. EVALUATION RATINGS</p>
<p>Each of the six factors identified in Section 5 above will receive an evaluation rating supported by justification in the Government's decision of which one consortium best meets the Government's needs. The following ratings will be utilized:</p>
<p>&bull; Good: The proposal demonstrates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. The prospective consortium has provided a comprehensive and detailed plan in accordance with the evaluation criteria as outlined in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low.</p>
<p>&bull; Acceptable: The proposal demonstrates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The prospective consortium has provided an adequate plan in accordance with the evaluation criteria as outlined in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.</p>
<p>&bull; Unacceptable: The proposal does not demonstrate an ability to meet or understand the Government requirements. The prospective consortium did not provide a plan in accordance with the evaluation criteria as outlined in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high.</p>
<p>7. COMMUNICATIONS WITH OFFERORS AND FINAL PROPOSAL REVISIONS</p>
<p>The Government will perform an initial review of the proposal(s) submitted. The Government reserves the right to make an award based on the initial proposals submitted in response to this synopsis/solicitation notice without further interactions. Proposals that do not contain the information requested are at risk of being determined Unacceptable in accordance with the evaluation ratings above. If the Government determines that further interactions and/or an opportunity to revise proposals is necessary, the Government reserves the right to contact all, some, or none of the offerors and/or request proposal revisions.</p>
<p>8. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>(a) Government Property: Government Property is not currently being provided. It is not anticipated that the consortium manager will require access to Government Property in order to carry out its role in this acquisition. Use of Government Property may be considered for individual project agreements. Terms and conditions regarding the tracking, use, disposition, and title to Government Property will be included in the resulting agreement to provide the framework for providing Government Property to individual project prototype performers. It is understood and accepted that time may be needed to implement Government Property requirements upon the first instance of property being provided. It is also understood that projects that require Government Property may take longer to award than those without property requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Security Clearance/Classification: The consortium manager will be responsible for coordinating clearance verification, access, and safeguarding of required classified resources. Tracking and disposition of this support will be the consortium manager's responsibility upon conclusion of the individual prototype project effort(s). Base Support and Government network access are not anticipated for the consortium manager or the individual prototype project performers at this time.</p>
<p>(c) Intellectual Property: with the exception of commercial software, which will be handled through commercial licensing, all software and technical data developed by the consortium manager or the individual prototype project performers is anticipated to be delivered with the following Government Purpose Rights: the rights to</p>
<p>&bull; Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation within the Government without restriction; and<br />&bull; Release or disclose technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation for United States Government purpose. <br />This definition applies to noncommercial technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation.<br />The Government reserves its right to negotiate intellectual property rights that differ from what is described above, as necessary.<br />(d) Accreditation:</p>
<p>Performers should note that some military information systems require access to source code for accreditation purposes. Accreditation is a part of security testing for certain Information Systems. The accreditation process is tailored to each new Information System, so the need for source code must be determined on a case-by-case basis and will vary based on the system program office associated with each project. The Government will make every attempt to identify the extent to which code will be required to complete accreditation and provide this information with the initial prototype project announcement. Any source code requirements will be captured in the project approval letter that the Government will send to the consortium manager following selection of a successful proposal. In such cases, source code requirements will also be included in the individual prototype project agreement between the consortium manager and the individual prototype project performer.</p>
<p>(e) Organizational Conflicts of Interest:</p>
<p>All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest must be disclosed (i.e., Offerors must disclose those situations in which, because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person or organization is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person or organization's objectivity in performing the agreement work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person or organization has an unfair competitive advantage). The disclosure shall include a description of the potential conflict as well as the action the Offeror has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. Proposals that fail to fully disclose potential conflicts of interest and/or do not have plans to mitigate this conflict may be rejected without evaluation and withdrawn from further consideration for award.</p>
<p>Throughout performance, the consortium manager will be required to monitor potential conflicts of interest between its individual project level performers and the contractors currently developing for and operating the targeted systems.</p>
<p>9. SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>(a) Specific terms and conditions of the resulting OT agreement will be negotiated and finalized with the selected consortium prior to award.</p>
<p>(b) The Government intends to make a 10 U.S.C. &sect;2371b OT agreement based on proposals submitted in response to this competitive combined synopsis/solicitation notice. All information in response to this notice is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government will publish an Intent to Award Announcement to FedBizOpps upon selection of a consortium in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation. The Government does not intend to provide debriefings to unsuccessful respondents. A notice of the Government's consortium award selection will be announced on FedBizOpps upon the conclusion of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>(c) Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. No sensitive or classified information will be discussed. Foreign-owned, controlled, or influenced firms are advised that security restrictions may apply that may preclude their participation in these efforts.</p>
<p>(d) The most effective time to handle potential problems is during the proposal preparation stage, i.e., prior to the proposal due date, not in the proposal. Therefore, if a prospective Offeror believes that any conflict of interest exists or may exist (whether organizational or otherwise), the Offeror is strongly encouraged to promptly raise the issue with the Agreements Officer by sending Offeror's contact information and a summary of the potential conflict by email to kari.wedemeyer@us.af.mil before time and effort are expended in preparing a proposal and mitigation plan. If, in the sole opinion of the Government after full consideration of the circumstances (including review of the Offeror's mitigation plan), any conflict situation cannot be effectively mitigated, the proposal may be returned without evaluation and withdrawn from further consideration for award under this combined synopsis/solicitation.</p>
<p>(e) For planning purposes only, offerors should assume an award date of 6 November 2018; however, proposals in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation will be assumed to be valid for 180 days from receipt of offer.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for radio frequency channel emulator (RFCE).<br /><br />Statement of Work</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>NASA Ames Research Center has identified autonomous swarms of rovers, drones, and spacecraft as an important architecture/technology that can enable new types of missions, expand capabilities of existing technologies, and reduce costs of hardware and operations. The center currently has two projects to develop enabling technologies for swarms: Connected, Autonomous, Smart Aerospace Systems (CASAS), a center directed activity to build up the infrastructure, process, and capability of autonomous swarms for space and aeronautics; and Starling, a Small Spacecraft Technology Program (SSTP) and Space Technology Mission Directory (STMD) funded mission to develop technologies that enable autonomous swarm operations.</p>
<p>The fundamental capability for any swarm operation is the ability for all the nodes (individual satellites or drones) to communicate with each other, much like we can using the internet or cell phones. Traditional communication between nodes in aerospace has been achieved by specialized protocols and hardware or managed through ground operations. Both approaches are difficult to adapt and expensive to scale for large numbers of nodes. New approaches are needed to enable network communications on a swarm that is flexible and robust.</p>
<p>Code TI has a requirement to develop a radio frequency (RF) communication system for swarms of spacecraft and drones in support of Starling and CASAS. Due to regulation requirements and difficulty simulating realistic RF communication, an advanced RF channel emulator is needed. The projects will use the channel emulator as a testbed to develop Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) solutions for these missions. The emulator will enable the projects to evaluate communication protocols, estimate swarm capabilities, test and mitigate risks prior to flight, and run realistic simulations using flight-like hardware in high-fidelity models of the environment. The simulations include scenarios to test the effectiveness of the hardware and protocols while performing mission activities.</p>
<p>2. SCOPE</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>The channel emulator must have the following features in order to test the MANET:</p>
<p>- Support frequency bands found in space and terrestrial applications<br />&bull; Preferably 100MHz to 12GHz<br />&bull; Accept 100MHz to 4GHz (S-Band)<br />- Support bandwidth up to 200MHz<br />- Support at least 16 RF nodes<br />&bull; Upgradable to reduce initial costs and allow expansion at later date<br />&#61607; Fully configured system support 96+ RF<br />- Allow customizable protocols<br />- Interface with simulation tools for realistic communication in mission scenarios<br />- Model and emulate physical effects found in aeronautics and space based communication<br />&bull; Propagation delays<br />&bull; Doppler effects<br />&bull; Interference <br />&bull; Power dissipation<br />- Work with Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) and Extendable Mobile Ad-hoc Network Emulator (EMANE) for reuse of existing network models <br />&bull; Integrate and model virtual nodes for large scale simulations<br />- Documentation to include<br />&bull; Users Manual<br />&bull; Application Programming Interface (API) Documentation</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>- A channel emulator which meets all the requirements above.<br />- A 12-month technical support services.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to The Printing Machine (TPM, Inc.) for the purchase of a 3-D Printer. This printer will allow TPL (Tobacco and Products Laboratories) to have a printer that will create full spectrum color parts with voxel-control system poised for future innovations. TPL needs the voxel technology at a low price. A voxel is a 3-dimensional pixel. Its long form is Volumetric Picture Element. Since there is no defined dimension or shape for a voxel, any object that has repeatability in its use to render a larger object can be categorized as a voxel. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1).. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within five (5) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to contract specialist at kpy3@cdc.gov by 11 a.m. 27 August 2018.</p>

Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation.

Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br />(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.<br />(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.<br />(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions, including alternative line items (provided that the alternative line items are consistent with subpart 4.10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation), or alternative commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:<br />(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.<br />(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--<br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or<br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or<br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.<br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.<br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.<br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent<br />Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.<br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.<br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.<br />(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />See Addendum<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of provision)<br /><br />ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS<br />Addendum to Paragraph (a). Paragraph (a) is changed to read as follows:<br />The Government will award a single Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation requirements, is most advantageous to the Government. The Government will determine the best value by trading off the following three evaluation factors: Factor I (Technical Acceptability), Factor II (Past Performance), Factor III (Price). As noted in the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1, non-conformance with the instructions to offerors, and any administrative requirements provided in the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 proposal preparation and submission instructions may result in removal of the proposal from further evaluation and consideration for award.<br /><br />Factor I, (Technical) is significantly more important than Factor II (Past Performance). All subfactors under Factor I (Technical) are of equal importance. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price (FAR 15.101-1).<br />To be eligible for award, an offeror must obtain a rating no lower than of "Acceptable" for Factor I (Technical Acceptability), as well as a rating of no lower than "Satisfactory Confidence/Neutral Confidence" for Factor II (Past Performance). Since factors I, II, and III may be traded off to determine the best value, the lowest price offered will not necessarily represent the best value to the Government.<br />The evaluation criteria for this solicitation is as follows:<br /><br />FACTOR I (TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY) - Proposals will be evaluated to determine whether the offer demonstrates an ability to meet the technical requirements specified in the solicitation. Factor I's evaluation will be based on the following three technical subfactors:<br />a. Subfactor one (1) - Case Management System Capabilities: The offeror's proposal shall be evaluated to determine the offeror's ability to meet each of the required system specifications listed in the PWS. The evaluation shall also include an assessment of the offeror's ability to meet the licensing and training requirements listed in the PWS, as well as the offeror's ability to provide a FedRamp IL4 compliant cloud hosted solution in accordance with the PWS.<br />b. Subfactor two (2) - Implementation: The offeror's proposal shall be evaluated to determine if the implementation plan addresses the requirements of the PWS and contains a timeline for completing the implementation within 120 days after contract award.<br />c. Subfactor three (3) - Post Deployment Services: The offeror's proposal shall be evaluated to determine the offeror's ability to provide the Post Deployment Services listed in the PWS.<br />Combined Technical/Risk Ratings<br />The Government will utilize the combined technical/risk rating system for the evaluation of all proposals against Factor 1 (Technical Acceptability) of the source selection criteria. Table 1 below outlines the ratings and their descriptions:<br />Table 1. Combined Technical/Risk Ratings<br />Rating<br />Description<br />Outstanding<br />Proposal indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements and contains multiple strengths, and risk of unsuccessful performance is low.<br />Good<br />Proposal indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements and contains at least one strength, and risk of unsuccessful performance is low to moderate.<br />Acceptable<br />Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate<br />approach and understanding of the requirements, and risk of<br />unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.<br />Marginal<br />Proposal has not demonstrated an adequate approach and<br />understanding of the requirements, and/or risk of unsuccessful performance is high.<br />Unacceptable<br />Proposal does not meet requirements of the solicitation, and thus, contains one or more deficiencies, and/or risk of unsuccessful performance is unacceptable. Proposal is<br />unawardable.<br /><br />FACTOR II (PAST PERFORMANCE) - Proposals will be evaluated to assess the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully based on relevant past performance information. More weight will be given to past performance efforts of the offeror (Prime Contractor submitting a proposal) than any of the past performance efforts of the offeror's proposed subcontractor(s).<br />Relevancy - Past performance evaluation will consist of two elements. The first element is relevancy. An evaluation of the offeror's past performance is done to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the offeror is to the effort to be acquired through the source selection. Recent is defined as a performance that is no older than three years from the date the solicitation is issued. Past performance information from an offeror or its subcontractors for which the offeror or its subcontractors where not listed as a prime will not be considered relevant.<br />In conducting a performance relevancy assessment, each offeror shall be assigned one of the ratings in Table 2.<br />Table 2. Past Performance Relevancy Ratings<br />Rating<br />Definition<br />Very Relevant<br />Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant<br />Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Somewhat Relevant<br />Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Not Relevant<br />Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Confidence Assessments - The second element of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the previous relevant contracts. The Government will review past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to performance confidence assessment.<br />In conducting a performance confidence assessment, each offeror shall be assigned one of the ratings in Table 3.<br />Table 3. Performance Confidence Assessments<br />Rating<br />Description<br />Substantial Confidence<br />Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Satisfactory Confidence<br />Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Neutral Confidence<br />No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. The offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past performance.<br />Limited Confidence<br />Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />No Confidence<br />Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />a. The information presented in the offeror's past performance documentation, together with information from the performance survey and other sources available to the Government, e.g.: Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) will be the basis of evaluation for this factor. The Government may use any and all available sources that allow for an accurate assessment of an offeror's past performance record.<br />b. In the event that an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. In this event the offeror shall receive a rating of "Neutral Confidence".<br />c. The Government may reject a proposal if it is found that the offeror deleted, misrepresented, or withheld any information that might have a negative impact on its past performance record.<br />d. In the event negative or adverse performance information is reported to or obtained by the Government, the offeror will be given an opportunity to submit a written rebuttal in response to the negative or adverse performance information received. The offeror's written rebuttal will be included as part of the Government's past performance assessment prior to any final rating being assigned.<br /><br />FACTOR III (PRICE) - Price proposals will be evaluated by combining all CLIN items for the maximum potential total award value over the entire potential contract period. In the event a mathematical error is discovered for any CLIN, the "Unit Price" multiplied by the total quantity for the CLIN/SCLIN shall govern in reaching the total extended amount. Prices for Options, will be evaluated as part of the total price of the proposal.<br /><br />52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (NOV 2017)<br />The Offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site located at https://www.sam.gov/portal.

If this contract is covered by the EO, the contractor must provide employees<br />with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work, up to 56 hours of paid<br />sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their<br />own illness, injury or other health-related needs, including preventive care; to<br />assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill,<br />injured, or has other health-related needs, including preventive care; or for<br />reasons resulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is like family<br />to the employee) who is the victim of, domestic violence, sexual assault, or<br />stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections<br />under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.<br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:<br />HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.48 per hour or $179.20 per week or $776.53 per month<br />HEALTH &amp; WELFARE EO 13706: $4.18 per hour, or $167.20 per week, or $724.53 per<br />month*<br />*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCA-<br />covered contract also covered by EO 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal<br />Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any<br />paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.<br />VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor, 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<br />HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)<br />THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:<br />1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.<br />Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<br />2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).<br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **<br />An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as<br />screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,<br />and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,<br />modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive<br />ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading<br />and cleaning of artillery ranges.<br />A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;<br />minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All<br />operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<br />If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:<br />The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<br />** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **<br />The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.<br />** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF-1444) **<br />Conformance Process:<br />The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor<br />prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final<br />determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which<br />shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day<br />of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure<br />to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested<br />parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the<br />date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act<br />and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are<br />included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<br />The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<br />1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<br />2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.<br />3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S.<br />Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).<br />4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.<br />5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the<br />contractor.<br />6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy<br />of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See<br />29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).<br />Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.<br />When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties<br />requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage<br />determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).<br />(End of clause)<br />52.233-2 SERVICE OF PROTEST (SEP 2006)<br />(a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from Eddie Tavares; 4800 Mark Center Drive, Suite 05D-01, Alexandria VA, 22350.<br />(b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with the GAO.<br />(End of provision)<br />52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)<br />This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Needle Acupuncture. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Needle Acupuncture products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Needle Acupuncture in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Needle Acupuncture will be established approximately December 2018 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately January 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Needle Acupuncture. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Needle Acupuncture.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Needle Acupuncture. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $562,934. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Forty-two (42) items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100% of the total volume in sales ($562,934). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought Notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin. Only ONE Vendor Part Number (PN) should be provided for each item/sample. Vendor must send the same part number(s) for evaluation(s) as provided in response to this QSL FBO announcement and as noted in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /><br /><strong>Required Products / Annual Usage in Units /</strong><br />5.1 -

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013)<BR><BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:

(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or
(2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.

AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.

Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010]<BR><BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are   are not   presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have   have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks  have , the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); 
(C) Are   are not   presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
(D) Have  , have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. During the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2)  Principal,  for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, streamlined procedures for evaluation and solicitation for commercial items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a separate written solicitation document will not be issued.
<p>NIST requires cavity ring-down mirrors for 2062 nm wavelength. As background, NIST designs highly sensitive instrumentation for ultra-trace gas detection in the mid and near-infrared. Recently, the gas sensing metrology group has recorded highly accurate spectroscopic reference data near a wavelength of 2000 nm for strong absorption bands of CO2. To support ongoing satellite-based remote sensing campaigns focused on global CO2 inventories, NIST will develop a frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectrometer for operation at a center wavelength of 2062 nm near the strong OCO-2 CO2 band.</p>

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>4. 52.222-17 Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers (MAY 2014)<br />(a) "Service employee", as used in this clause, means any person engaged in the performance of a service contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as those terms are defined in 29 CFR part 541. The term "service employee" includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a contractor or subcontractor and such persons. <br />(b) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise provided herein, in good faith offer those service employees employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of award of this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the service employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this contract in positions for which the service employees are qualified. <br />(1) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of service employees necessary for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ fewer employees than the predecessor Contractor employed in connection with performance of the work. <br />(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, there shall be no employment opening under this contract, and the Contractor and any subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to any person prior to having complied fully with this obligation. <br />(i) The successor Contractor and its subcontractors shall make a bona fide express offer of employment to each service employee as provided herein and shall state the time within which the service employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the period within which the service employee must accept the offer of employment be less than 10 days. <br />(ii) The successor Contractor and its subcontractors shall decide any question concerning a service employee's qualifications based upon the individual's education and employment history, with particular emphasis on the employee's experience on the predecessor contract, and the Contractor may utilize employment screening processes only when such processes are provided for by the contracting agency, are conditions of the service contract, and are consistent with Executive Order 13495. <br />(iii) Where the successor Contractor does not initially offer employment to all the predecessor contract service employees, the obligation to offer employment shall continue for 90 days after the successor contractor's first date of performance on the contract. <br />(iv) An offer of employment will be presumed to be bona fide even if it is not for a position similar to the one the employee previously held, but is one for which the employee is qualified, and even if it is subject to different employment terms and conditions, including changes to pay or benefits. (See 29 CFR 9.12 for a detailed description of a bonafide offer of employment). <br />(c)(1) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (b) of this clause, the successor Contractor and any subcontractors (i) may employ under this contract any service employee who has worked for the contractor or subcontractor for at least three months immediately preceding the commencement of this contract and who would otherwise face lay-off or discharge, (ii) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any service employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, 41 U.S.C. 6701(3), and (iii) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any service employee(s) of the predecessor contractor whom the Contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular service employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job (see 29 CFR 9.12 (c)(4) for additional information). The successor Contractor bears the responsibility of demonstrating the appropriateness of claiming any of these exceptions. <br />(2) In addition, any Contractor or subcontractor that has been certified by the U.S. Small Business Administration as a HUBZone small business concern must ensure that it complies with the statutory and regulatory requirements of the HUBZone Program (e.g., it must ensure that at least 35 percent of all of its employees reside within a HUBZone). The HUBZone small business Contractor or subcontractor must consider whether it can meet the requirements of this clause and Executive Order 13495 while also ensuring it meets the HUBZone Program's requirements. <br />(3) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to permit a Contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive order or law. For example, the requirements of the HUBZone Program (see FAR subpart 19.13), Executive Order 11246 (Equal Employment Opportunity), and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 may conflict, in certain circumstances, with the requirements of Executive Order 13495. All applicable laws and Executive orders must be satisfied in tandem with, and if necessary prior to, the requirements of Executive Order 13495, 29 CFR part 9, and this clause. <br />(d)(1) The Contractor shall, not less than 30 days before completion of the Contractor's performance of services on the contract, furnish the Contracting Officer with a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. Where changes to the workforce are made after the submission of the certified list described in this paragraph, the Contractor shall, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause, not less than 10 days before completion of the services on this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer with an updated certified list of the names of all service employees employed within the last month of contract performance. The updated list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment, and, where applicable, dates of separation of each service employee under the contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors. <br />(2) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives. <br />(3) The Contracting Officer will direct the predecessor Contractor to provide written notice (Appendix B to 29 CFR chapter 9) to service employees of their possible right to an offer of employment with the successor contractor. Where a significant portion of the predecessor Contractor's workforce is not fluent in English, the notice shall be provided in English and the language(s) with which service employees are more familiar. The written notice shall be- <br />(i) Posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite; or <br />(ii) Delivered to the service employees individually. If such delivery is via e-mail, the notification must result in an electronic delivery receipt or some other reliable confirmation that the intended recipient received the notice. <br />(e)(1) If required in accordance with 52.222-41(n), the predecessor Contractor shall, not less than 10 days before completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors. If there are no changes to the workforce before the predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor Contractor is not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of performance and the requirements of 52.222-41(n) are met. When there are changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the predecessor Contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less than 10 days prior to performance completion. <br />(2) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives. <br />(f) The Contractor and subcontractor shall maintain the following records (regardless of format, e.g., paper or electronic) of its compliance with this clause for not less than a period of three years from the date the records were created. <br />(1) Copies of any written offers of employment or a contemporaneous written record of any oral offers of employment, including the date, location, and attendance roster of any service employee meeting(s) at which the offers were extended, a summary of each meeting, a copy of any written notice that may have been distributed, and the names of the service employees from the predecessor contract to whom an offer was made. <br />(2) A copy of any record that forms the basis for any exemption claimed under this part. <br />(3) A copy of the service employee list provided to or received from the contracting agency. <br />(4) An entry on the pay records of the amount of any retroactive payment of wages or compensation under the supervision of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division to each service employee, the period covered by such payment, and the date of payment, and a copy of any receipt form provided by or authorized by the Wage and Hour Division. The Contractor shall also deliver a copy of the receipt to the service employee and file the original, as evidence of payment by the Contractor and receipt by the service employee, with the Administrator or an authorized representative within 10 days after payment is made. <br />(g) Disputes concerning the requirements of this clause shall not be subject to the general disputes clause (52.223-1) of this contract. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR part 9. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between or among any of the following: The Contractor, the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the service employees under the contract or its predecessor contract. The Contracting Officer will refer any service employee who wishes to file a complaint, or ask questions concerning this contract clause, to the: Branch of Government Contracts Enforcement, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20210. Contact e-mail: displaced@dol.gov. <br />(h) The Contractor shall cooperate in any review or investigation by the Department of Labor into possible violations of the provisions of this clause and shall make such records requested by such official(s) available for inspection, copying, or transcription upon request. <br />(i) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the Contractor or its subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, appropriate sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the Contractor or its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order 13495, the regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary, or as otherwise provided by law. <br />(j) The Contractor shall take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance. However, if the Contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the Contractor may request that the United States, through the Secretary, enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States. <br />(k) The Contracting Officer will withhold, or cause to be withheld, from the prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the same prime Contractor, such sums as an authorized official of the Department of Labor requests, upon a determination by the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, that there has been a failure to comply with the terms of this clause and that wages lost as a result of the violations are due to service employees or that other monetary relief is appropriate. If the Contracting Officer or the Administrator, upon final order of the Secretary, finds that the Contractor has failed to provide a list of the names of service employees working under the contract, the Contracting Officer may, in his or her discretion, or upon request by the Administrator, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of the payment of contract funds until such time as the list is provided to the Contracting Officer. <br />(l) Subcontracts. In every subcontract over the simplified acquisition threshold entered into in order to perform services under this contract, the Contractor shall include a provision that ensures- <br />(1) That each subcontractor will honor the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (c) of this clause with respect to the service employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a predecessor Contractor and its subcontractors; <br />(2) That the subcontractor will provide the Contractor with the information about the service employees of the subcontractor needed by the Contractor to comply with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause; and <br />(3) The recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (f) of this clause. <br />(End of clause) <br />5.

<DESC>The unit on Neuromodulation and Synaptic Integration (NSI) is a new laboratory being established at the NIMH. This laboratory will utilize cutting-edge electrophysiological studies to determine how information is processed by the brain at the cellular, microcircuit, and systems levels to ultimately understand the computations that drive physiological behavior and psychiatric disorders. We utilize anatomy and whole-cell slice electrophysiology in combination with other techniques, including optogenetics, UV uncaging, transgenic mice, viral approaches, and pharmacology to dissect how synapses and intrinsic factors that control excitability in neurons are regulated by receptors that are implicated in psychiatric disorders and are the major target of most pharmacological treatments for this disease. For both anatomy and electrophysiology, it is imperative that tissue be of the highest quality. Vibratomes are specialized instruments used to slice brains for both anatomical and electrophysiological studies and have gained increased interest due to their remarkable slicing capabilities. Thus, these specialized instruments have made the endeavors of anatomy and electrophysiology more practical and increased the quality of the data. To meet the needs of the NSI Unit it has been determined that there is a critical need for Leica vibratomes and equipment needed to calibrate and maintain them.

<p style="text-align: center;">(v) Statement of Need</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Laboratory of Neuropsychology investigates higher brain functions such as perception, memory, and social reward. We will be working on a series of studies that investigate the neural underpinnings of socially motivate behavior. This work in nonhuman primates requires recording single units from deep brain structures in nonhuman primates interacting under social circumstances. The requirement is to obtain a wireless single-unit recording system that works with electrodes designed in the Laboratory of Neuropsychology to reach deep brain targets (Leopold brush electrode arrays). A major problem with wireless solutions for nonhuman primates is the size of the implant, susceptibility of the system to repeated connections, and mechanical damage. We require a system that allows elimination of high density connectors. This can be done by direct wire-bonding our brush arrays to a preamplifier/multiplexor that can be permanently implanted with the electrodes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Background Information</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is the first acquisition of a wireless recording system for the Section on the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. This purchase is to advance the capabilities of the section from seated, head-fixed recordings to freely moving animals, which will enable far greater flexibility in the study of social behavior. Without a wireless recording system, the Laboratory of Neuropsychology would be unable to expand its ability to research the neurophysiology of relationships between conspecifics.</p>

<p>1352.237-71 SECURITY PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS-LOW RISK CONTRACTS (APR 2010)<br />1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN<br />(a) The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities. <br />2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting <br />3. Identify constraints in transparency <br />(b) The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />(c) Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />(d)There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&not;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates).<br />2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the S. Government.<br />7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity). <br />(e) After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.<br />(f) The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.<br />(g) Questions regarding items (a) through (f) within this language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.<br />AWARDS EXPECTED TO GENERATE ENVIRONMENTAL DATA OR PEER-REVIEWED<br />PUBLICATIONS (OCT 2016)<br />Special Award Conditions:<br />1. Data Sharing: Environmental data collected, created, or generated under this contract or<br />order must be made publicly visible and accessible in a timely manner, free of charge or at<br />minimal cost that is no more than the cost of distribution to the user, except where limited by<br />law, regulation, policy, or national security requirements. Data are to be made available by the<br />contractor in a form that would permit further analysis or reuse: data must be encoded in a<br />machine-readable format, preferably using existing open format standards; data must be<br />sufficiently documented, preferably using open metadata standards, to enable users to<br />independently read and understand the data. The location (internet address) of the data should be<br />included in the final report. Pursuant to NOAA Information Quality Guidelines, data should<br />undergo quality control (QC) and a description of the QC process and results should be<br />referenced in the metadata. Link to guidelines:<br />http://www.cio.noaa.gov/services_programs/IQ_Guidelines_103014.html</p>
<p>2. Environmental data are defined by NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 212-15:<br />Management of Environmental Data and Information as recorded and derived observations and<br />measurements of the physical, chemical, biological, geological, and geophysical properties and<br />conditions of the oceans, atmosphere, space environment, sun, and solid earth, as well as<br />correlative data such as socio-economic data (personally-identifiable information regarding<br />human subjects must be properly protected or removed), related documentation, and metadata.<br />Digital audio or video recordings of environmental phenomena (such as animal sounds or<br />undersea video) are included in this definition. Numerical model outputs (the data produced by<br />computer simulations of environmental processes) are included in this definition, particularly if<br />they are used to support the conclusion of a peer-reviewed publication. Data collected in a<br />laboratory or other controlled environment, such as measurements of animals and chemical<br />processes, are included in this definition. This does not apply to laboratory notebooks,<br />preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer review reports,<br />communications with colleagues, or physical objects, such as laboratory specimens.</p>
<p>3. Data Accessibility: Approved submission of data by the contractor to NOAA National<br />Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), or to a publicly accessible data repository as<br />specified in the approved Data Management Plan, shall be sufficient to satisfy the data<br />accessibility requirement as of the date the submission was performed. The contractor shall<br />notify the NOAA Program Official when data accessibility has been performed. After the<br />acceptance of data by the government, unless specifically required in the solicitation, Data<br />Management Guidance, and period of performance of the contract, the contractor is not required<br />to maintain the data. Once the performance period for the contract has expired, the contractor is<br />no longer responsible for maintaining this information. If the data are not submitted to NCEI,<br />but are instead made accessible by some other means (e.g., on a web server hosted by the<br />contractor) then contractor should explain plan for continued availability after the contract period<br />ends.</p>
<p>4. Timeliness: Data accessibility must occur no later than publication of a peer-reviewed<br />article based on the data, or two years after the data are collected and verified, or two years after<br />the original end date of the contract or order (not including any extensions or follow-on funding),<br />whichever is soonest, unless an extension to the date for data submission has been authorized by<br />the Contracting Officer in coordination with the NOAA Program Official.</p>
<p>5. Disclaimer: The Contractor shall ensure the following statement accompanies data produced<br />under this award and made available to the public: "These data and related items of information<br />have not been formally disseminated by NOAA, and do not represent any agency determination,<br />view, or policy."</p>
<p>6. Failure to Share Data: Failure or delay on the part of the contractor to make environmental<br />data accessible in accordance with the approved Data Management Plan, unless authorized by<br />the Contracting Officer, may lead to enforcement actions, and will be considered by NOAA<br />when making future award decisions. The contractor is responsible for ensuring subcontractors<br />also meet these conditions.</p>
<p>7. Funding acknowledgement: Federal funding sources shall be identified by the contractor in<br />all scholarly publications. An Acknowledgements section shall be included in the body of the<br />publication stating the relevant contract award number. In addition, funding sources shall be<br />reported during the publication submission process using the FundRef2 mechanism, located at<br />http://www.crossref.org/fundref/, if supported by the Publisher.</p>
<p>8. Manuscript submission: The final pre-publication manuscripts of scholarly publications<br />produced with NOAA funding shall be submitted to the NOAA Institutional Repository located<br />at http://library.noaa.gov/repository after acceptance, and no later than upon publication, of the<br />paper or article by a journal. NOAA will produce a publicly visible catalog entry directing users<br />to the published version of the article. After an embargo period of one year after publication,<br />NOAA will make the manuscript itself publicly visible, free of charge, while continuing to direct<br />users to the published version of record.</p>
<p>9. Data Citation: Publications based on data, and new products derived from source data,<br />must cite the data used according to the conventions of the Publisher, using unambiguous labels<br />such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). All data and derived products that are used to support<br />the conclusions of a peer-reviewed publication must be made available in a form that permits<br />verification and reproducibility of the results.<br />1330-52.203-70 Scientific Integrity and Research Misconduct<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision -<br />Scientific activities mean activities that involve inventorying, monitoring, observations, experimentation, study, research, integration, modeling, and scientific assessment.</p>
<p>Scientific integrity means the condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting and applying the results of science that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security.</p>
<p>Presentation of scientific activities results includes the analysis, synthesis, compilation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of the Department of Commerce or the United States of America.</p>
<p>Scientific and Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing scientific and research activities, or in the products or reporting of the results of these activities. It specifically includes intentional circumvention of the integrity of the scientific and research process and actions that compromise that process, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.</p>
<p>Investigation is formal collection and evaluation of information and facts to determine if scientific or research misconduct can be established, to assess its extent and consequences, and to recommend appropriate action.</p>
<p>(b) General Guidelines<br />1. Maintaining Integrity. The Contractor shall maintain the scientific integrity of research performed pursuant to this contract award including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations and adjudications of allegations of research misconduct.<br />2.

By executing this contract, the Contractor provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigating, and reporting allegations of scientific and research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigation and reporting of such misconduct.<br />5. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this provision in subcontracts at all tiers that involve research being performed under this contract.</p>
<p>(c) Investigating Misconduct Research<br />1. Initiating Investigation. If the Contractor determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it shall notify the contracting officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the Contractor shall: <br />a. Promptly conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of scientific and research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted.<br />b. If the investigation leads to a finding of scientific and research misconduct, obtain adjudication by a neutral third party adjudicator. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.<br />2. Finalizing Investigation. When the investigation is complete, the Contractor shall forward to the contracting officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response (if any).<br /><br />(d) Findings and Corrective Actions <br />1.

The Department of Commerce may accept the Contractor's findings or proceed with its own investigation, in which case the Contractor shall fully cooperate with the investigation. The contracting officer will inform the Contractor of the Department's final determination.<br />2. The Department of Commerce reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the contract and applicable laws and regulations. Such remedies and actions may include, but are not limited to, disallowance of costs, recoupment of contract payments, and suspension or debarment.<br />1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018)</p>
<p>In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.</p>
<p>(a) Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members. <br />Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim. <br />Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: <br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. <br />The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Requirements.</p>
<p>1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. <br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. <br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable). <br />4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable. Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace <br /><br />i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace</p>
<p>Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.</p>
<p>ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.</p>
<p>5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. (c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.</p>
<p>For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:</p>
