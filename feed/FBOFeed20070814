This equipment is needed to provide a complete automated system for carrying out in virto drug permeation testing of the transfer rate across natural or artificial membranes.  Such a system will consist of vertical diffusion cells (Franz cells) and an appropriate sampling system capable of efficient automated operation for time periods of 12-24 hours.  Diffusion cells: complete cell assemblies must include receptor chamber, donor chamber and clamp, dosage wafer (300 mg, ?infinite dose?), sampling and media replace ports.  There must be an outside jacket for temperature control and helix stirrer.  There system must accommodate at least six cells.  Sampling System: an appropriate sampling system for simultaneous sampling and collection from at least six cells with automatic media replacement at time of sampling.  System must maintain temperature (typically 37 degrees Celsius) of cell receptor solution for all cells and maintain replacement media at the same temperature.  System must be capable of automated dilution of samples.  

This unit was selected because it is the only known instrument offering a fully automated diffusion cell apparatus with the capabilities described above.  Since many of the the experimental runs will be 12 hours or longer, an automated system is required.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.  However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The GeXP chemistry is unique, and utilizes a chimeric and universal priming strategy to profile specific user defined genes of interest, eliminate PCR amplification bias, and allow the size analysis of gene specific amplicons in the multiplex. The GeXP enables scientists to run multiple (up to 29) control reference genes in a single multiplex panel, increasing validity of gene expression data.The GeXP electropherogram data allows scientists to observe the Gene specific PCR amplicon size of each gene in the multiplex as a confirmation of specificity in the multiplex assay. The GeXP has a low sample requirement of only 20 ng total RNA.The GeXP has a two 96 well microtiter plate capacity for additional load and leave operation.  
This system will allow the examination of tissue culture treated with various chemicals or microbial toxins for genetic expression.   Thirty genes can be examined per reaction/well.
This is the only unit known in the marketplace with these unique capabilities.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.  However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>U.S. Government seeks to lease approximately 2990RSF (Yielding at leaset 2600USF ANSI/BOMI OFFICE AREA SQUARE FEET) of Office space within the Quincy, MA area, specific space requirements are described below. The space must meet requirements for fire-safety plus handicapped access in accordance with ADA and UFAS guidelines.  Space shall be located within a prime commercial office district with attractive, prestigious professional surroundings with a prevalence of modern design and /or tasteful rehabilitation in modern use. 

The office should be located as close as possible to the top floor of the building in order to facilitate connection to the roof.  Accessibility to the roof is necessary.  Roof space must be available to accomodate antennas.  Offerors must ensure that there are no local codes or ordinances prohibiting installation of these antennas and certify as such when submitting their offers. 

FAA limitations on antenna height may preclude acceptance of space in buildings located in an airport flight path. 

Due to critical radio monitoring the offered space must have a clear view to the radio horizon of the surrounding metropolitan areas.  The space offered may be rejected if, upon survey measurements of the electromagnetic environment by Commission engineers, it is determined that one or more of the following criteria exist:
a) Any single continuously-radiating transmitter produces a field strength over the site exceeding 50 mV/m

b)The root-sum-square of the field strength from continuously-radiating transmitters in any 30MHz-wide portion of the radio spectrum exceeds 300mV/M
c) Signals from fixed transmitters produce spurious emisionsor measurable desensitization in Commission receivers which results in impaired monitoring ability in the public safety, marine, or aviation bands. 
d) Tall, oversized buildings within one quarter mile radius impair monitoring ability or direction finding in the public safety, marine or aviation bands.  

Four (4) secure inside parking spaces are required. Preferably inside the same building. Building should have 24 hour a day on-scene security.  To facilitate installation and servicing of vehciles, a duplex outlet of at least ten ampere capacity should be provided close to the parking spaces.

<DESC>Contractor shall take down all non-oak trees and brush as marked on attached map .  Removal is to be accomplished only via mechanical means such as shearing or otherwise cutting the trees and then chipping them and/or moving them into designated on-site slash piles.  For any tree with a DBH of 8 inches or less contractor may chip or shred instead of cutting and stacking.  Resulting chips must be less than 2 inches in diameter and no longer than six inches and must be spread out so the litter depth is 4 inches or less.  Any remaining debris that is larger than the dimensions listed above must be raked, mowed or otherwise placed in the slash piles for burning The slash piles must be tightly stacked at least 50 feet from the edge of the water in a manner to allow for efficient consumption by fire and cannot be stacked to heights greater than thirty feet (30') nor larger than one hundred feet (100') in length or width.  Individual slash piles will not consist of less than ten (10) trees and must be at least 300 feet from the roads on the west and south parts of the unit.  Slash must be tightly stacked to aid in burning piles. All remaining stumps must be cut or otherwise mechanically reduced to a height of less than six inches (6") and each stump greater than 4" in diameter must be promptly treated with Garlon or a similar generic formula in accordance with manufacturer recommendations.  Absolutely no material should be left in the wetlands scattered throughout the cutting area. Period of Performance:  Cutting work shall be performed between July 15 and March 15 and only when surface soils are dry or frozen.  Once commenced, the work should proceed with due diligence.  Work should not be performed during the firearms deer season.  It is anticipated that this job will be completed by March 15, 2008 but the period of performance may be extended due to extenuating circumstances.  The prescribed burn phase would be completed in the spring or fall following completion of the cutting and would be in compliance with an approved prescribed fire plan to be provided by the government. Background:  The site has been divided into three areas.  The first area contains approximately 8 acres of trees, the second has approximately 13 acres and the third has approximately 14 acres.  Total approximate acreage for the three areas is 35 acres.  Contractor is responsible for verifying acreages prior to submission of pricing.  Contractor is not responsible for any trees scattered in the grassland areas that are less than 6" DBH.  Contractor should not cut oak trees marked with paint scattered in the wooded area.  Pricing shall be submitted for each of the three areas.  Tree species present include elm, cottonwood, boxelder, willow, and other species mixed in as well.  While there is little commercial value to these trees, contractor may harvest any of it for personal use or sale and the Government will lay no claim for title or reimbursement there from. Use of biomass is encouraged but not required under this contract. In general, this site is normally fairly dry however there are scattered wet spots located throughout the site. The majority of the trees are located either surrounding wetlands or along the edges of ditches and streams. There are both surface and partially buried rocks present so care should be taken with equipment to minimize damage.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.   SOCIOECONOMIC PROGRAMS:  This procurement shall be awarded as a Firm Fixed Priced Service Contract.  For information purposes, the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 113110, Forrestry and Logging, with a size standard of $6.5 million.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT WITH SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR NOAA FISHERIES, ALASKA FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER, TED STEVENS MARINE RESEARCH INSTITUTE, JUNEAU, ALASKA.    PURPOSE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT IS TO EXAMINE THE GROWTH OF THE GORGONIANS FANELLIA SP. AND ISIDELLA SP. (BAMBOO CORAL) AND THE BLACK CORAL LILLIPATHES WINGI TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF FISHING ACTIVITIES ON BENTHIC HABITAT.  ONE ASPECT OF THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON DAMAGE AND REMOVAL OF EMERGENT EPIFAUNA, ESPECIALLY CORALS AND SPONGES, FROM THE SEAFLOOR.   THE CONTRACTOR?S SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO: 1)  SELECTION OF THE SKELETAL STRUCTURE OF EACH OF THREE CORAL SPECIMENS WITH A WATER-COOLED, DIAMOND BLADE SAW.  THE LOCATION OF SECTIONING WILL BE SPECIFIC TO EACH SPECIES AND DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY TO EXTRACT ADEQUATE MATERIAL TO BEST ELUCIDATE AGE FROM THE LEAD-210 DATING TECHNIQUE.  THE SAMPLE DESIGN MAY BE A SECTION SERIES (RANGING FROM THE YOUNGEST PORTIONS NEAR THE TIP TO THE OLDEST PORTIONS NEAR THE BASE) WHERE CORE MATERIAL IS REMOVED WITH A MICROMILLING MACHINE, OR IT MAY BE SINGLE SECTION NEAR THE BASE (THE THICKEST AND PRESUMABLE OLDEST PORTION OF THE COLONY) WHERE A SERIES OF CONCENTRIC ARCS WOULD BE TRACED OUT AND EXTRACTED WITH A MICROMILLING MACHINE.  EXTRACT APPROXIMATELY 4-6 SAMPLES PER SPECIMEN (12-18 SAMPLES TOTAL) DEPENDING ON THE DIMENSIONS OF EACH CORAL?S SKELETON STRUCTURE.  THE SERIES CHOSEN FOR EXTRACTION SHOULD IDEALLY COVER THE MAXIMUM LIFE SPAN OF THE COLONY (100 TO 150 YEARS IS IDEAL FOR TRACKING THE DECAY OF LEAD-210)  2) SECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EXTRACTIONS WILL BE MOUNTED ON GLASS SLIDES AND VIEWED WITH EITHER REFLECTED OR TRANSMITTED LIGHT TO ELUCIDATE ANY GROWTH ZONES VISIBLE IN THE SECTIONS.  MAGNIFICATION WILL BE VARIED FROM LOW TO HIGH TO COVER ALL POSSIBILITIES OF GROWTH ZONE SIZE AND RESOLUTION.  ESTIMATES OF AGE WILL BE MADE FROM ANY QUANTIFIABLE GROWTH ZONES SEEN IN THE SECTIONS AND AN ESTIMATED GROWTH RATE AND LONGEVITY WILL BE MADE BASED ON THIS INFORMATION.  AGREEMENT BETWEEN ESTIMATIONS FROM GROWTH ZONE COUNTS AND LEAD-210 DATING WILL PROVIDE A BASIS FOR DETERMINING A ROUTINE METHOD FOR ESTIMATING AGE.  LONGEVITY WILL BE ESTIMATED FROM MEASUREMENTS OF THE LARGEST KNOWN COLONIES FOR EACH SPECIES.  MEASURE THE DECAY OF EXOGENOUS (UNSUPPORTED) LEAD-210 OVER THE LENGTH OF THE SKELETAL STRUCTURES, OR FROM THE RADIAL SAMPLES SERIES, TO DETERMINE A GROWTH RATE.  THIS PROCESS WILL INVOLVE THE MEASUREMENT OF LEAD-210 VIA ALPHA-SPECTROMETRY AND RADIUM-226 VIA HIGH-RESOLUTION INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY (HR-ICPMS).  FOR EACH SPECIES SPECIFIC SAMPLE SERIES, LEAD-210 AND RADIUM-226 WILL BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE STATE OF DISEQUILIBRIA BETWEEN THE TWO ISOTOPES.  DETERMINATION OF LEAD-210 AND RADIUM-226 WOULD BE ANALYZED USING WELL ESTABLISHED (I.E. PUBLISHED) PROTOCOL 3) SUMMARIZE DATA IN REPORT.  4) RETURN ALL REMAINING SPECIMENS TO THE AUKE BAY LABORATORIES FOR ARCHIVAL.   SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION IS THE ONLY RESPONSIBLE SOURCE.  SJSURF IS A COLLABORATOR ON THE PROJECT TITLED ?BIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS TO ESTIMATE THE RECOVERY OF DISTURBED BENTHIC HABITAT IN ALASKA? AND A CO-PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR OF THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED TO THE HABITAT AND ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES PROGRAM OF THE ALASKA FISHERIES AND SCIENCE CENTER.  THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PROPOSAL WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ITS SUCCESS.  THEY DESIGNED THE SAMPLING PROTOCOL AND HAVE ALREADY COMPLETED SOME PRELIMINARY SCREENING OF THE SAMPLES, ALL OF WHICH ARE IN THEIR POSSESSION.    SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION IS THE ONLY VENDOR WITH THE UNIQUE BACKGROUND AND KNOWLEDGE TO PROVIDED THESE CRITICAL SERVICES TO EXAMINE THE GROWTH OF THE GORGONIANS FANELLIA SP. AND ISIDELLA SP. (BAMBOO CORAL) AND THE BLACK CORAL LILLIPATHES WINGI.  THERE IS NO OTHER VENDOR THAT CAN PROVIDE THESE SERVICES.  BASED ON THE ABOVE, NOAA BELIEVES SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION  IS THE ONLY VENDOR AVAILABLE THAT CAN MEET THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS AND IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO WORK ON THIS CRITICAL PROJECT.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE IS FOR SEPTEMBER 1, 2007 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2008.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE GOVERNMENTS INTENT TO NEGOTIATE THIS REQUIREMENT WITH THE SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION, UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF 41 USC253(C)(1), ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE, ANY OTHER RESPONSIBLE SOURCES MAY SUBMIT A STATEMENT OF QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE WHICH, IF TIMELY RECEIVED, WILL BE EVALUATED BY NOAA TO DETERMINE IF A COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION SHOULD BE ISSUED.

<CONTACT>Steve Langley, Program Staff Assistant, Phone 202-233-2025, Fax 202-233-2050, Email procurement@nifl.gov
<DESC>The National Institute for Literacy (Institute) was established to ensure that literacy would have a place on the federal policy agenda and to invigorate a national effort to improve adult literacy.  Its primary activities to strengthen literacy across the lifespan are authorized by the U.S. Congress under two laws, the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) in the Workforce Investment Act and the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB).  The AEFLA directs the Institute to provide national leadership regarding literacy, coordinate literacy services and policy, and serve as a national resource for adult education and literacy programs. The NCLB law directs the Institute to disseminate information on scientifically based reading research pertaining to children, youth, and adults as well as information about development and implementation of classroom reading programs based on the research.  A significant component of the Institute's NCLB-authorized dissemination effort has focused on parents with well-developed literacy skills who are accustomed to consulting printed materials for information.   While the Institute will continue to disseminate information based on the findings from scientific research to these parents, the Institute is beginning to turn its attention to a different group of parents.

The Institute is seeking technical assistance in starting a pilot project that focuses on parents of K-3 children who would benefit from learning more about how to support their children's acquisition of reading skills but who are not likely to use stand-alone print materials.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), intends to procure a  Thuramed Tetras Synthesizer from CreoSalus/Thuramed, 5609 Valley Rd, Louisville, KY 40228. NIDDK intends to procure this system by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.  The requirements necessary are (1) capacity for 106 concurrent 7ml reactions (2) capacity for 20 concurrent 80ml reactions; (3) Indexed Rotary Platform; (4) Digital Servo Pumps; (5) Asynchronous synthesis software; (6) Full networking capability; (7) Concurrent variable scale synthesis; (8) Fully independent reaction vessels; (9) Online cleavage into individual vessels without disturbing other reactions; (10) Remote alert notification; (11) Modular construction; (12) Reagent stations dedicated to each single reagent; (13) 2-4 strategically placed purge stations for reaction vessel evacuation; (14) Fully expandable by addition of reagent stations; (15) All reagent stations capable of external line reagent source; (16) 1-32 pumped reagent stations (17) Sequence importation; (18) Automatic protocol application; (19) Software that calculates volume and dry weight of chemicals needed (20) Independent reaction vessel processing; (21) Manual control over each reaction vessel; (22) Integrated computer with Windows XP; (23) 36 total stations; (24) Bench top unit; (25) 360 degree internal access; (26) Self enclosed; (27) 360 degree internal visibility.

The Thuramed TETRAS from Creosalus/Thuramed can successfully accomplish the aforementioned requirements because it is the only asynchronous multiple, parallel synthesizer for peptides and other related types of molecules.  The Thuramed TETRAS proven capability to perform up to 106 isolated reactions with variable scales and reagent combinations.  The instrument is also constructed to have a small footprint (it is a 30x30x30 in. cube) which is essential for a small laboratory. The utilization of this equipment will increase the pace of making molecules, more rapidly identifying the most promising lead compounds for anti-HIV activity, and handle the chemical reactions that must be performed to make a library of molecules?highly reactive reagents. The TETRAS is engineered to handle such reactive reagents because there is minimal tubing from reagent bottle to reaction vessel, and the tubing is selected to withstand many reactive chemicals.

This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient details to allow NIDDK to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to procure from Coherent Inc, 5100 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95054, a quantity of one (1) new Sapphire 488-200 CDRH System (P/N: 1049754); 2) Sapphire HP Heatsink RoHs comp (P/N: 1110126); 3)Sapphire Productivity Plus (P/N: 1060735).  The Institute intends to procure this system under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.  Coherent is the sole authorized distributor of the Coherent Sapphire 488-00 CDRH System.

The Sapphire 488-00 CDRH System is a solid state laser, required as the excitation light source for our total internal reflection fluorescence microscope.  The laser needs to have CM output of 200mW at 488nm.  It is essential to have the solid-state laser for our experiments, in order to avoid excess heating of the experimental area. The polarization should be single longitudinal mode beam with good power stability and long coherence length (i.e. the beam quality should be equivalent to the beam quality of the Coherent Sapphire 200 or better).

This laser will be used as a component of our total internal deflection fluorescent microscope systems that will be used for kinetic studies of macromolecular complex assembly reactions.  This laser will be used as on of the interchangeable components between several parallel systems we are building, and since our existing system uses the Coherent sapphire 488-200, only the same laser can satisfy our needs.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ) OR AN INVITATION FOR BID (IFB), NOR IS IT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. IAW FAR Part 6.302-1( c ) – Only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements / brand name justification: items peculiar to one manufacturer, NASA / Kennedy Space Center (KSC) intends to enter into a sole source procurement of the following items from The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, 01760-2098. 1.	MATLAB Maintenance for 26 perpetual license seats consisting of the following products:  Curve Fitting Toolbox, Database Toolbox, Excel Link, Mapping Toolbox, Statistics Toolbox, Signal Processing Blockset , Simulink Fixed Point, System Identification, MATLAB Report Generator, SimMechanics, Optimization Toolbox, Simscape, Virtual Reality, Gauges Blockset, & Stateflow.	 Last item. The referenced MATLAB software is determined to be the sole brand name capable to meet the Government requirements of software maintenance offered by MATHWORKS. The MATLAB software is used in the performance of analysis functions for the KSC Launch Service Program (LSP).	Full and open competition is impractical for the following reasons: MATLAB software must be maintained in order to ensure compatibility with processes, procedures, and custom developed applications that are used to perform the analysis functions of LSP.  Failure to maintain the software would incur a risk to the program.  The acquisition of any other brand would therefore represent an unacceptable technical risk to KSC LSP missions.    The Government intends to acquire these commercial items using FAR Part 12, and 13 or a combination thereof.  Interested organizations may submit, in writing, their capabilities and qualification to perform the effort, to the identified point of contact, no later than 4:30 ET on 21 August 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications in response to this notice are not acceptable.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. All contractual and technical questions must be in writing (e-mail) to Janice M. Nieves not later than 17 August, 2007, 10:00AM (EST).	Telephone questions will not be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a site license for the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for the TEAMS Designer failure detection and diagnostics development software, the TEAMS RDS software capable of supporting up to 25 users, training in the use of the TEAMS Designer and TEAMS RDS software, and one year of maintenance and support of the aforementioned TEAMS Designer and TEAMS RDS software. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Qualtech Systems, Incorporated (QSI) for the following reasons: 1.  The TEAMS software is a unique, integrated software package for the development of real-time diagnostic systems.  QSI is the sole provider of the TEAMS software.	NASA and MSFC are currently using TEAMS in performing functional fault analysis of the Ares I design.  Continued use of TEAMS software will facilitate evolution of the models supporting the analysis to an actual operational capacity for diagnosing the Ares I vehicle during several element testing, transportation, and integration events, including prelaunch checkout of the flight vehicle for adherence to launch commit criteria on launch day. Although there are other tools which provide diagnostic capabilities (some of which are being evaluated for other Ares I applications), the suite of functions provided by TEAMS, as well as the associated developmental and operational interfaces, are highly unique.  These capabilities cannot be found in other tools.  Additionally, other tools do not provide the necessary set of capabilities and performance levels required to support the Ares I mission for this application. 2.  In addition to the intended application of the TEAMS software for Ares I, TEAMS is also being applied on the Orion vehicle to support similar failure detection and diagnostic functions.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 08/17/07.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, PDN is involved in a large phenomenological study focusing on the interrelationship between regression in autism and immune dysfunction. We propose to conduct a longitudinal natural history study of 50 children with autism and strictly defined regression, 50 children with autism and no history of regression, 50 typically developing children, and 25 children who meet criteria for Rett?s Disorder (a genetic disorder in which children have autistic features with clear regression). Subjects will be 12 ? 48 months of age at study entry in order to capture regression as close to its onset as possible. Systematic prospective evaluations will be utilized in order to provide validation to the phenomenon of regression in autism, determine diagnostic and functional outcomes, and evaluate behavioral, medical and immunologic functioning.    

1. To characterize and validate the regressive phenotype in children with autism. 

2. To characterize the immune response in children with autism.
a. Distinct immunologic responses and cytokines abnormalities will be evident in children in the regressive autism sample, but not in the non-regressive autism, Rett?s Disorder, or typically developing samples.

3. To identify neurobiologic markers for autism through the techniques of metabolomics, proteomics and genomics (e.g. gene expression profiles). 

In addition, based on evidence of a pro-inflammatory profile seen in autism from the lab of Dr. Carlos Pardo, we have designed a treatment trial using the anti-inflammatory properties of minocycline.  Efficacy will be tested by examining the cytokine and chemokine profiles of serum and cerebrospinal fliud (CSF) before and after treatment.

The period of performance: 12 Months. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690
and the Size Standard. An award to any other source would affect the NIH prior and current research. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

<DESC>This is a notice of a proposed contract action published to notify potential sources that The USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Wildlife Services (WS) contracting office intends to issue a sole source award to The Institute of Makers of Explosives (IME).  The purpose of this action is for IME to conduct a nationwide review of the USDA, APHIS, WS explosives safety program including its policies and directives, administration, training programs, operating procedures, and compliance with explosives industry safety standards. The contractor will be required to provide recommendations on how WS can provide the safest possible work environment for its employees who work with explosive materials and enhance public safety.  This review includes APHIS/WS employee handling and use of explosives and the safeguarding of human life. These services will consist of an evaluation of the WS explosives safety program, national in scope, for WS which has approximately 1,500 employees using, storing, and transporting explosive pest control pyrotechnics in 50 States and 85 Certified Explosives Specialists operating in 22 States using binary explosives and other high explosive materials.  Another 130 WS employees use explosive charges to operate rocket and cannon wildlife capture nets for avian influenza surveillance.

The IME is the safety and security association of the commercial explosives industry in the United States and Canada.  The IME is a non-profit, incorporated association founded to provide accurate information and comprehensive recommendations concerning commercial explosive materials.  The IME establishes the safety standards for the commercial explosives industry which are observed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Occupational Safety and Health Administration; U.S. Department of Transportation; and other Federal and State explosives regulatory agencies in formulating regulations pertaining to the safe storage, transportation, and use of explosives materials.  IME personnel are considered the predominant experts in the field of explosives safety as evidenced by the weight the Federal explosives regulatory agencies place on IME explosive safety standards.  No other source has the broad technical knowledge and expertise needed to evaluate WS? highly specialized applications of explosive materials.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with the University of Milan, Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Milan, Italy to investigate the role of telomere length and methylation status, including global methylation and methylation in E-cadherin, p16, iNOS, TLR-2, and hMLH1 genes, in DNA from blood or buccal cells in relation to gastric cancer risk in a nested case-control study within the Shanghai Women?s Health Study. The contractor shall:  1) Perform PCR-based analysis of telomere length on 525 blood or buccal DNA (henceforth referred to as DNA) samples in duplicate from the Shanghai Women?s Health Study;  2)  Perform bisulfite treatment priori to methylation analysis for 1050 DNA samples;  and 3)  Perform PCR amplification and pyrosequencing for global methylation analysis and methylation analyses in the promoter area of E-cadherin, p16, iNOS, TLR-2, and hMLH1 genes for 525 samples.  The Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory of the University of Milan, Italy, is a leading molecular epidemiology laboratory that has acquired the expertise and resources critical for conducting the proposed analysis in large environmental epidemiologic studies.  The University of Milan is the only institution worldwide to have pyrosequencing equipment for methylation analysis dedicated exclusively to environmental health-related research.  The pyrosequencing technology on bisulfite treated DNA has the sensitivity and accuracy to detect very small changes in DNA methylation, such as those that are of interest in epidemiology studies.  The laboratory implements standardized quality control procedures that take full advantage of the pyrosequencing potential.  In particular, the QC procedures permit accurate determination whether bisulfite treatment, a critical step in DNA methylation analysis, resulted in complete cytosine conversion.  The real-time PCR assay that the laboratory uses for telomere length analysis also have the high sensitivity and precision needed to test the study hypothesis.  The University of Milan conducted analysis of DNA methylation in relation to gastric cancer risk for the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, under purchase order MQ606468.  The conduction of the DNA methylation study in the same lab will allow NCI to simplify the control of laboratory operations and guarantee standardized quality control procedures.  This will  enhance the comparability of results should NCI decides to conduct pooled analysis for more detailed evaluation of gene-environment interactions in the future.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service they may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 23, 2007. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov. It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent by Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to award a sole source contract to Road Ready, Inc., P.O Box 1065, Lowell, AR 72745-1065. The period of performance will from date of award through six (6) months or until completion of services. The contractor is required to use its data from driver physical qualification examinations to conduct statistical analysis on various aspects of driver medical conditions and disorders. Analyses will include descriptive statistics on various medical conditions in the commercial driver population, identification of the percentage of drivers who are physically unqualified to drive, and an exploration of the link between driver medical conditions and driver disqualification and safety performance. This information will be used to guide the current rulemakings on merging the medical certificate with the CDL license and the national registry of medical examiners, and future rulemakings that may propose revisions to the current physical qualifications standards and guidelines. 


The vendor is uniquely qualified to perform this work based on their ability to satisfy FMCSA requirements. The contractor chosen for this work, RoadReady Inc., is the only source of driver physical qualifications data in a format that allows analysis using statistical software products.  The only other sources of this data would be one or more of the States that collect this data, but none of those States stores the driver qualification data in a database that facilitates analysis. Those few states that collect this data either stored in paper files or in an electronically scanned format such as a .pdf file that cannot be analyzed using statistical software without manual input of the data. The Agency has contacted the States that collect this information and they lack the resources to input the data into a format that would enable statistical analysis. In addition, because the data involves sensitive health information, the States are reluctant to share the data with the Agency, and lack the resources to analyze the data themselves. RoadReady is therefore the only source of this data that has the resources readily available to conduct the necessary analyses in a reasonable timeframe.


In addition, the contractor has expert knowledge of the motor carrier industry, the driver physical qualification process, and the data systems necessary for collecting and analyzing the data. In evaluating the Agency?s need for information on driver physical qualifications, FMCSA has determined that RoadReady is the only source of this data and therefore the only suitable source that could produce the required analysis in a timely manner. Because of these unique qualifications, and the period within which the agency must work to complete these rulemakings requirement, it has been determined that only RoadReady Inc. is uniquely qualified to successfully complete the forthcoming analyses within the period of performance required by the agency.  
 
This award will be made in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures FAR Part 13.  

Any questions comments or concerns should be directed to the Contracting Specialist (Non Fed) Robert ?Skip? Day at robert.day@dot.gov at (202) 385-2304.

<DESC>INVESTMENT DIVISION
STOCK DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT SERVICES
REQUIREMENTS AND STATEMENT OF WORK


1.	Introduction

This statement of work describes the tasks and requirements needed by the Small Business Administration??s Investment Division to manage the sale of marketable securities received from Small Business Investment Companies (??SBICs??).   

2.	Program Background Summary

The Investment Division of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) administers the SBIC program, which was created by Congress to stimulate and supplement the flow of private equity capita and long-term debt to small businesses.  SBICs are privately-owned and privately-managed venture capital funds.  These funds are licensed and regulated by the SBA and are eligible to receive supplemental funding (leverage) from the SBA.  Under the terms of the SBIC program, all SBICs must invest only in small businesses.  

As of June 13, 2007, there were 378 active SBICs, of which 153 receive leverage from the SBA through the issuance of ??participating securities??.  Although no new participating securities (PS) SBICs are currently being licensed, the existing PS funds reported over 1,800 investments totaling $1.5 billion in FY 2006.  Under the terms of the PS program, SBA is entitled to certain distributions from SBICs and may receive such distributions in the form of either cash or marketable securities (in kind distributions).

3.	Objective

The Investment Division??s objective is to sell securities it receives within a limited time frame (generally a few weeks, but with some flexibility), while minimizing losses relative to the value of the securities as of the distribution date.  To accomplish that objective, SBA is seeking to enter into a contractual arrangement with an organization which is knowledgeable about and proficient in the evaluation and trading of thinly traded equity securities and which has experience in the management of distributions by venture capital funds.

4.	Term of the Contract

One year with four one-year options.

5.	Scope of the Contract

The contractor will provide services associated with the management of distributions received by SBA.  Such services will include advising SBA as whether securities that an SBIC proposes to distribute qualify as ??Distributable Securities??, as defined in 13 CFR 107.50; developing an appropriate liquidation strategy for each security received, subject to SBA??s objectives and direction; identification and resolution of any legal or other restrictions affecting SBA??s ability to sell securities; trading of securities; establishment and maintenance of relationships with transfer agents and any other third parties necessary to conduct activities under the contract and satisfy SBA??s overall objectives; and preparation of reports to SBA concerning transactions and the status of securities under management.

The contractor will provide SBA with same-day notice by telephone and by facsimile or email of any sale of securities, including price and quantity of shares sold, and will follow up with hard copies of trade confirmations by regular mail.  The contractor will prepare a monthly activity report containing complete information on each transaction concluded, including any gain or loss on disposition of securities, the number of shares and current market value of any long positions in SBA??s account, and the cost charged to SBA for the period and on a cumulative basis for the fiscal year to date.  The contractor shall deliver this monthly report electronically as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, no later than 10 calendar days after the end of the month.

6.	Place of Performance/Travel

The contractor shall perform the duties listed in paragraph 5 at its place of business.  As requested, the contractor shall travel to the Investment Division??s place of business located at 409 3rd Street SW, 6th floor, Washington, DC 20416.

7.	Confidentiality and Disclosure

All information obtained by the contractor from SBA and SBICs shall be disclosed only to SBA personnel and shall not be used for any reason by the contractor and its staff other than performance of its duties required hereunder.  The contractor shall sign a confidentiality agreement to safeguard the information provided by SBA or prepared by the contractor with regard to this contract.

8.	Proposal Requirements

8.1	General

The technical/price proposal is to be submitted in two original and five hardcopies.  An electronic version of the proposal should also be submitted in Microsoft Word and/or PowerPoint as appropriate.  The technical/price proposal will be incorporated into the contract at contract award.

8.2	Proposal Elements

?X	Technical Expertise ?V Demonstrate the proposed team members?? experience in the evaluation and trading of equity securities, including securities that are thinly traded, subject to trading restrictions, or issued by companies that have recently made an initial public offering.  Include discussion of the firm??s capabilities in departments that will provide necessary support services (trading desk, legal, etc.) to the broker or other individual who will be SBA??s primary point of contact.  Key persons who would be responsible for SBA??s account must be identified specifically.
?X	Account documents ?V Any documentation that the contractor will require to establish an account in SBA??s name must be submitted to SBA as part of the proposal.  SBA is prepared to provide the contractor with a taxpayer identification number and a signed form W-9; documentation indicating the SBA employees who have responsibility for the account and are permitted to authorize trades and transfers of funds; wire instructions for cash proceeds received from sales of securities; and other information needed for the management of SBA??s account.  SBA generally does not enter into supplemental client agreements governing matters such as indemnification, arbitration, provision of cash management or other supplemental services, etc.
?X	Method of Payment ?V SBA is not permitted to pay brokerage commissions via a deduction from sale proceeds.  Instead, it must pay earned commission by separate wire transfer.  Indicate in your proposal whether you are able to accommodate the following suggested procedure (or propose an alternative procedure):  For each trade executed, the contractor will generate a trade confirmation showing number of shares sold, sales price, gross proceeds, and commission earned.  The contractor will fax or email the confirmation to SBA, which after review and approval of the confirmation will wire the commission amount to the contractor for credit to SBA??s account.  SBA expects that this process will normally be completed by the time settlement takes place.  Following settlement, the contractor will wire out the gross proceeds from the sale of securities in accordance with standing wire instructions provided by SBA. 
?X	Proposed costs ?V On a per-share basis.

9.	Contract Award

Evaluation will be conducted and selection will be made in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  Award will be made to the party whose proposal represents the best value to the Government considering the quality of the technical proposal and the relative cost.  Pursuant to FAR Part 15, SBA reserves the right to award a contract based upon initial responses submitted and without any further discussions with the potential awardees.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

There is no guarantee as to the amount of work a contractor will receive during the term of the contract. Each project will be a competitive negotiated procurement therefore contractors must submit their most favorable prices.  

In most cases, project funding is immediately available to start construction therefore all discounts should be sought.  

Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the proposed contract.  Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussion.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable. 

Bid Bonds will not be required to be submitted with Phase I proposals.  100 Percent Payment and Performance bonds will be required once the final negotiated price of each delivery order is established.

<b><u>Port and Maritime Sector Monitoring and Control Center</b></u>
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Port and Maritime Sector Monitoring and Control Center.

AMP is an autonomous government agency established in 1998 to unify the maritime responsibilities of the National Port Authority; the Directorate of Vessels and Consular Affairs within the Ministry of Treasury and Finance; the Directorate of Marine Resources within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Nautical School of Panama within the Ministry of Education.

The Government of Panama (GOP) is interested in implementing security measures which meet international maritime trade security standards. These international security initiatives include 24-hour manifests, Container Security Initiative (CSI), Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), the International Maritime Organization's International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code), International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Long Range Identification and Tracking Systems (LRIT), Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) and Vessel Monitoring Services (VMS).  The implementation of the Center would help AMP to manage the compliance of the entire Panamanian maritime sector with these international security standards while more effectively, efficiently and safely processing the increasing volume of commercial cargo and vessel traffic in the principal ports of Balboa, Col?n and Crist?bal.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $331,341 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp</a></b>. Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00 PM LOCAL TIME, September 7, 2007 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-464-07MR-1149
<RESPDATE>080207

<CONTACT>ALEISHA  MOORE, PURCHASING AGENT, Phone 304-256-3215, Fax 304-256-3350, Email MOORE.ALEISHA@DOL.GOV
<DESC>MSHA IS SEEKING SOURCES FOR THE FOLLOWING:
Background:

While filling an SCBA oxygen tank for mine rescue training, a large, extremely hot fire erupted at an oxygen pump severely burning the Benchman.  The root cause of the fire was inadequate training of mine personnel in the setup, maintenance, and operation of the SCBA filling system.  Provisions of the new Miner Act that require more mine rescue teams and additional mine rescue training will increase the use of SCBA?s and the likelihood of another oxygen fire and injury.  To stay ahead of this risk, a training video will be developed to cover oxygen fire hazards and the precautions needed to help ensure the safe refilling of SCBA?s using oxygen booster pumps.


Final Product:

A training video, in DVD format, shall be prepared.  The video shall deal with the fire hazards of filling SCBA?s using an oxygen booster pump.  The video shall cover the entire SCBA filling process, including but not limited to, installation/construction of the refilling facility, receipt of oxygen supply bottles, maintenance of equipment, and training of personnel.  The video will be prepared for an audience of mining personnel that have received some prior training in the filling of SCBA?s. 

Deliverables:

The contractor will prepare a draft script and suggest various video footage/graphics required.  The contractor will coordinate with MSHA in determining the overall presentation concepts.  The contractor should rely on MSHA for administrative functions in order to control contract costs.  

MSHA will coordinate input and review of the script by MSHA and industry personnel (mine operators, mine rescue team benchmen, booster pump manufacturers, O2 suppliers, and others as necessary).   

Upon approval of the script by MSHA the contractor will assist MSHA in defining the video storyboard.  The contractor will help define the shots required and shoot and edit the video as required.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to extend the response date to 24 Aug 2007 and to offer to provide the draft statement of work, draft functional requirements documentation and the draft contract data requirements list (CDRLs), DD Form 1423, for the CH-46E torque system upgrade effort detailed below.  Please note that these documents are not final and are subject to revision.  Due to the urgency of this effort, the first of two technical interchange meetings will take place within 30 days after contract award, the preliminary design review will be conducted 4 months after contract award and the critical design review will be conducted 7 months after contract award.  If you would like a copy of the documentation referenced above, please email Julie Paul at julie.paul@navy.mil.  

COMNAVAIRSYSCOM is seeking information from potential suppliers regarding the H-46E torque indicating system.  The torque indicating system provides engine performance information to the pilot and copilot.  The system consists of six torque sensors, two temperature compensators, two signal conditioners and two torquemeter indicators.  Inaccuracies in the existing torque indicating system have resulted in unnecessary maintenance and parts replacement.  Also, support equipment required to maintain the torque indicating system has become obsolete and is no longer procurable.  The new torque indicating system will incorporate the functionality of the signal conditioners and torquemeter indicators into one indicator that resembles the existing torquemeter indicator.  Minimal new support equipment will be required and the requirement for existing torque test sets will be eliminated.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  This sources sought synopsis is seeking information from sources that are capable of manufacturing torque indicating systems.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis should be in the form of a technical approach that outlines processes needed to ensure that all aspects of a torque indicating systems engineering methodology are used in the execution of the program.  At a minimum, (1) the new torque indicating system will be compatible and integrated with existing H-46E equipment; (2) meet or exceed accuracy of the H-46E onboard aircraft integrated maintenance system (AIMS); (3) resemble the current H-46E torquemeter indicator; (4) provide torque signal validity; (5) require minimal peculiar support equipment for maintenance; (6) have minimal operational and maintenance impact; and (7) combine functionality of the current H-46E signal conditioner and torquemeter indicator into one indicator that utilizes existing location on both the pilot and copilot consoles.  Due to the urgency of the need and the need for the torque instrumentation to interface with other on board systems, the Contractor shall possess recent H-46E engine instrument development experience for this effort.  It is requested that all interested parties submit a capability statement/documentation (under 25 pages) specifically addressing the technical approach to be taken to satisfy their statement of work tasking, potential teaming arrangements, related past performance, general corporate information, and their business size.  TELEPHONE REPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR RETURNED.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING (i.e. fax, email, or letterhead).  All responses will be kept confidential and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any proposal preparation costs associated with responding to this synopsis.  Proprietary Data in the responses will be protected where so designed.  All responses shall be submitted by 12:00 p.m. (Noon) Eastern Standard Time on 10 Aug 2007.  All responses must be submitted to the Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: Julie Paul, Code: AIR-2.4.3.3.2., Bldg. # 2272, Suite 353, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547, Email address:  Julie.Paul@navy.mil; Telephone Number (301) 757-6570; FAX (301) 757-9039.

<ARCHDATE>08132008
<CONTACT>Sherry Gossett Contract Specialist 7022938348     sgossett@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Regional Office, is issuing this announcement to identify potential small business sources who would be interested in performing biological monitoring services that include establishing a standardized protocol and monitoring of the western yellow-billed cuckoo at each restoration site and along the entire lower Colorado River.  This is a sources sought notice only and there is no solicitation currently available.  The western yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis) is a neo-tropical migrant species that breeds in deciduous woodlands, restricted to riparian habitat that lines rivers and streams in the western United States.  Cuckoos historically bred throughout most of western North America from southern British Columbia to Mexico and in most of California.  Cuckoos have been nearly extirpated from much of its previous range including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada.  The early decline of the species was linked mostly to the extensive loss of riparian of in nesting areas.  During the late 1800's and early 1900's, large areas of riparian habitat in the western United States were destroyed or degraded by reservoirs, channelization for flood control, conversion to agriculture and grazing, and urban development, leaving the remaining riparian areas in isolated patches of varying size and shape.  Yellow-billed cuckoo populations in the western United States have declined dramatically over the last 100 years.  They are listed as endangered by the Nevada Natural Heritage Program, as endangered by the California Department of Fish and Game, and a species of special concern by the Arizona Game and Fish Department.  In 2001, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decided that the western birds represent a distinct population segment, and are now a candidate for federal "threatened" status.  Despite concern over the fate of the species, few aspects of yellow-billed cuckoo life history have been adequately studied.  The Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program Habitat Conservation Plan requires the Bureau of Reclamation to restore 5,940 of cottonwood-willow habitat, including 4,050 acres specifically for the yellow-billed cuckoo.  Breeding habitat characteristics must be determined to evaluate the success of restoration projects.  Reclamation needs to establish a standardized protocol and monitor the yellow-billed cuckoos at each restoration site and along the entire lower Colorado River to evaluate long-term trends.  The purpose of this project is to document the distribution, abundance, and habitat use of yellow-billed cuckoos in riparian areas of the Lower Colorado River. Yellow-billed cuckoo surveys will provide information on their status and distribution, and establish baseline data that can be used for continued monitoring of cuckoo populations and riparian vegetation under the Multi-Species Conservation Plan.  Reclamation is currently seeking small business firms that have proven expertise and ability to initiate this large scale biological monitoring project.  The selected firm must have an extensive knowledge of desert riparian systems and monitoring of low density bird populations.  Small business firms that may be interested in participating in this requirement shall submit by e-mail to Sherry Gossett at sgossett@lc.usbr.gov the following information:  (1)  Summary of experience in performing the required work, include a list of past projects that were similar in scope and complexity to this work and names, addresses, and telephone numbers of points of contacts.  Explain how the work is similar in scope and complexity; (2)  Summary of Proposed Key Personnel that may be utilized in performing this work, include a list of the proposed key personnel and resumes and qualifications of those individuals;  and (3)  Provide any other pertinent information that will convince Reclamation that you are highly qualified to perform this requirement.  Interested parties should include the following information in their response as well:  (a) Business name, address, cage code, size classification based on NAICS size standard, socio-economic classification [i.e. HUBZone, 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran, Women-Owned, etc.], and a point of contact.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541620 and the related small business size standard in dollars is $6.5 Million.  All information must be provided to Ms. Gossett at the above e-mail address no later than 3:00 p.m., PDT on September 01, 2007.  Questions regarding the project may also be directed to Ms. Gossett at the above e-mail address.  This sources sought notice should not be construed in any manner to be an obligation or commitment of the U.S. Government.  There will be no contract issued as a result of this sources sought synopsis.  This sources sought synopsis cannot result in any claim for reimbursement of costs for any effort you expend in responding to this request.   This notice is not a request for proposal and the information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner.

This, the initial phase, involves the Announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies that are certified under the 8(a) program with SBA an opportunity to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this Announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this Announcement/SIR1. Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this Announcement/SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 20 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 	1.  8(a) Certification and Business Declaration Form: 	(a) Provide certification letter from SBA documenting vendor's enrollment in the SBA's 8(a) program and classification as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code 541330, Engineering Services. 	(b) Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form. 2.  Past Performance and Experience: (Note: Past performance represents "how well" an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has "done it."  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the SOW.) 	(a) In order to be determined acceptable vendors must have a minimum of five (5) years experience in performing engineering and technical support services as identified in the attached PWS.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  Vendors shall provide a list of relevant past and present contracts performed for Federal, State, or Local Governments or commercial sources within the past five (5) years involving effort of same or similar complexity, magnitude, and level.  The vendor's documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information stated below. (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 	(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor's performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 3.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must demonstrate the capability to provide management and staffing commensurate with the demands of this requirement in the following areas: 	(a) Vendors must demonstrate that a Contract/Technical Manager will be available at the time of contract award.  Qualifications of the Technical Manager are identified in PWS, paragraph 3.3, Position Requirements and Qualifications.  The documentation describing the individual's qualifications may include a brief synopsis or resume of work experience.  It should include present position or title, experience in managing contracts for similar services of scope and size (include duration or length of all experience), and educational/training background in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and management competence.  In addition, the vendors shall specify a "good faith effort" that the Technical Manager will remain in their respective position for a minimum of one (1) year. 	(b) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 25 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to, a spreadsheet identified month by month for the annual period containing a list of employees and the contracts on which they performed or a signed certified list of employees with date of employment including employees managers and the manager's qualification. A copy of the current contract (DTFA-02-02-D-14709), can be downloaded from the AMQ Internet at http://amq.mmac.faa.gov/FOIA.asp  Interested firms that can comply with and meet the special standards of responsibility addressed in this Announcement/SIR 1 should respond with their documentation in writing to:  Federal Aviation Administration Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center NAS Contracting Division Attn:  AMQ-210/Joy Dickson Room 313, Multi-Purpose Building 6500 South MacArthur Blvd. P.O. Box 25082 Oklahoma City, OK  73125-4933 Note: For overnight mail the ZIP code is 73169 The date and time for receipt of responses is 3:30 p.m. local time, August 29, 2007, (facsimile and e:mail responses are not permitted).  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined unacceptable; therefore, not considered as one of the qualified companies.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary. Because all incoming mail and other parcels, including overnight air deliveries, are being pre-screened, before being delivered, vendors are encouraged to submit responses early.

<ARCHDATE>11302007
<CONTACT>Point of Contact -Donald MacGee, Contract Specialist, 617-494-2803
<DESC>This notice is being issued only to extend the response date for DTRT57-07-SS-0459, due to systems problems a new notice had to be issued.  The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) is seeking access to domestic and international airline schedule data required by the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS).  This data set is important for the mission of ETMS.  ETMS is an operational FAA system providing the means by which the FAA can monitor and control air traffic.  As such, the ETMS relies upon schedule airline data to allow the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) and other traffic managers to effectively and safely manage the nations airports and airspace.  Current and accurate flight schedule information is used in the ETMS to balance aircraft capacity and demand for airports and airway fixes, and is used by ATCSCC and specialists to predict traffic problems and avoid delays by implementing national traffic management initiatives.  Without this data areas could become overloaded and compromise air safety.  The nature of the required services demands that the ETMS have continuous and reliable schedule flight data worldwide. Volpe Center, as the ETMS Hubsite, has subscribed schedule flight data from Official Airline Guide (OAG) Worldwide, Inc. for years.  ETMS has developed software to read the OAG files and process the airline schedule data with historical flight path data to produce a new ETMS Schedule Database (SDB).  ETMS uses the SDB to provide schedule information to the traffic managers. The Volpe Center is seeking capability information on schedule flight data in the form mentioned under Capability Requirements below.  This is not a request for competitive proposals or qualifications.  The information must show that any interested party has the ability to provide the requisite services, data and operational support that meet the following Government requirements: ETMS Schedule Flight Data Requirements The Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, and services, except otherwise specified, to provide subscription services of the worldwide schedule flight data as specified below. 1.Weekly Bulk Data transmission The Contractor shall provide for a full flight schedule to be made available weekly on a day and time to be coordinated between the Volpe Center and the Contractor. The range of the data shall be for 45 days. The following fields are required in each weekly delivery: Leave Country Code; FAA Airport Code; GMT Leave Time; Arrival Country Code; FAA Airport Code; GMT Arrival Time; Flag Code; Equipment Code; FAA Carrier Code; Flight Number; Days of Service; Category; Effective Date; Discontinue Date, As part of the subscription service, the Contractor shall provide changes to the bulk data file as stated below: Provide effective and discontinue dates. If there is no effective date available the date reverts to the first day of the delivered data files.  If there is no discontinue date the date reverts to the last date of data.  There are to be no assumptions. Provide a carrier code in the carrier code field when there is no match in the FAA carrier code table. This change will give the FAA more flexibility in determining which carriers are missing from the FAA carrier code table. Provide for the deletion of multiple flight records. Since the flight data is primarily a marketing tool, the schedule information contained in the scheduled flight data may reflect a slightly different set of flights from what is actually flown during the applicable time period. Provide all flight leg segments for flights worldwide. Provide all segments of scheduled flight records.  There will be times a carrier will fly from a U.S. airport to an international airport with a non-ticket-selling stop at another U.S. airport.  The second segment of this flight should be included. The Volpe Center currently receives the worldwide flight schedule data on a weekly file on each Wednesday.  In addition to that, Volpe Center receives three support reports. Daylight Savings Time File, If the validity of the worldwide schedules file crosses a Daylight Savings Time event, the contractor shall provide a support file which contains the following: Carriers affected by DST event; Time Divisions affected by DST event; Data used for performing DST Not Actioned job; Flights affected by DST event. Production Run Totals File; A file provides the totals of each weekly production run. Unresolved FAA Codes File; A file will be provided on a weekly basis that outlines any unresolved FAA Carrier Codes.  The file should show the carrier names that do not have FAA Codes.  It should outline the carrier name and their International Air transport Association (IATA) codes.  2. Quarterly Bulk Aircraft/City Tracking System (ACTS) Files. The contractor shall provide a copy of airlines equipment and airports updated during the previous quarter (Quarterly Codes file).  The Volpe Center currently receives one single quarterly file in March, June, September and December. The Quarterly Codes file should include the following fields: The first two records on the file are Header Records identified with UHL1 and UHL2.  These records contain the filename, date of creation and copyright information. Equipment Code and Airport Code Locations Records follow in order labeled below: Equipment Code Records; Equipment End Record; Airport Code Location Record; End Record. The Equipment Code Record contains the IATA assigned code, equipment type and equipment name. The Airport Code Location Record contains the airport and city code, the longitude and latitude coordinates for the airports, the airport and city name, UTC difference between local time at the city or airport and Greenwich, England and a country code which refers to the DOT World Airways Code List. 3. DATA TRANSMISSION: The contractor shall have the capability to transmit the data to the ETMS receiving site via reliable, robust and independent communication line.  The files will be placed in a directory on a host machine, which can be accessed remotely by Volpe Center staff. Files provided by the contractor shall be compatible with existing ETMS receiving equipment.  If not, the contractor shall specify and offer standard off-the-shelf equipment to receive the files and interface with ETMS. Current ETMS SDB file format is proprietary to the current long time contractor OAG, Worldwide, Inc. The file structure for the bulk data transmission files shall be: ASCII; Sequential File; 56 characters per line. The contractor shall provide the schedule flight data in a digital stream for direct input into the existing ETMS SDB software for processing.  The contractor shall make provisions that the data feed may have to interface with the ETMS firewall as the point of demarcation, if requested. Also, the data feed shall be supported by an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) and a backup generator power at the contractors facility, if requested. System Availability and Reliability. All subscribed data must be available at the receiving site at scheduled delivery time. Availability means the data, if they are available to the contractor, are received by the receiving site within the update interval 99.99% of the time. Capability Requirements: All responsible sources may respond to this Sources Sought Notice and responses will be fully considered by the Agency.  Interested firms are required to demonstrate that its schedule flight data is compatible with ETMS by supplying a sample data set in a CD ROM at no cost to the Government, and two (2) copies of document that describes in sufficient detail, the files, the types and formats of the files and any special software and/or requirements to access the files in the CD so as to allow an evaluation of a bonafide capability to satisfy the Governments requirements by August 30, 2007.  The weekly schedule flight data shall begin at 0000Zulu on a Wednesday thats 40 ? 5 days before April 2, 2006 so as to allow for the capability of handling daylight savings time. The Volpe Center expects a total of four weekly files.  The quarterly data shall cover December 1, 2005 through February 28, 2006. Volpe Center expects one quarterly file.  In addition to test for the compatibility of the data and the ETMS SDB software, Volpe Center and ETMS shall check for accuracy of the data and completeness of the sample data set versus the worldwide schedule flight data set Volpe Center is currently subscribing.  Do not include any pricing information.  Please send documentation to the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Attn: Donald MacGee, RTV-6D2, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA  02142-1093.

<DESC>Sources sought.  This is not a request for offers.  Large businesses please do not respond.  The General Services Administrative (GSA), PBS, Fort Worth, TX, is attempting to determine if there are any Service Disabled Veteran, 8(a) or HUBZone certified firms qualified to perform architectural/engineering and related services in support of the requirements for the facilities for U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) and Customs and Border Protection Programs. Firms must have adequate staffing and be able to handle multiple projects simultaneously within the United States to provide comprehensive planning, design for Land Ports of Entry (LPOE) on the northern and southern borders of the United States; to provide outstanding quality, value and operational design. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances function, cost, constructability, aesthetics, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for the nation's chief border inspection agency's employees while conveying to visitors the strength and democratic values of the nation.  They are to address the complex operational issues of a Land Port of Entry and be efficient to build and maintain. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements and the facility will be designed in metric units. All projects will be LEED certified, and shall be designed to meet the Silver standard as defined in the U.S. Green Buildings Council in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System to the extent the budget allows. 

Projects will be renovated, expanded or new land ports of entry on the northern and/or southern border. These projects will be located in a variety of contexts, from remote rural sites to highly urbanized sites and could range from $5M to over $100M in estimated construction costs. The facilities comprise multiple buildings, including inspection facilities, garages, and offices, as well as complex site circulation and inspection technologies. The LPOEs will be secure facilities that also act as gateways to our country and should make an architectural statement that is appropriate and responsive to the local context, efficient movement of trade and commerce, the security requirements of law enforcement agencies, and the flexibility of changing operational and technological requirements. Expedited design and delivery approaches will be promoted, including prototype design, bundling of projects, prefabricated and modular construction, and use of pre-designed components. Various project delivery methods, including CMc, traditional design-bid-build, and bridging-design-build, will be used. This is a solicitation for A/E services for a period of one year with four one-year option periods.  Successful A/E firms will be required to be licensed/registered within the State prior to the award of a contract.  Firms are not required to be geographically located, and are not required to have an active design production office, within the state to be considered for award.

The selected A/E firm shall primarily provide design services, including feasibility studies, bridging documents (35% construction documents), and full design and construction services, and research and reports related to the design of LPOEs. The final designs will be operationally complex and technologically sophisticated site and civil-intensive projects with a balance between aesthetic, functional, and security issues, including state-of-the-art data and telecommunications systems, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other requirements. 

The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: problem analysis, feasibility studies, energy analysis, life cycle costing, building information modeling, surveys, site and existing conditions surveys, design, planning, interior design, traffic and civil engineering, and estimating services for new construction, and repair and alteration projects. At times the contract may also require selected firms to provide civil engineering, boundary and topographical surveying, sustainable design, environmental studies, quality control testing, asbestos sampling/hazard assessment/ abatement design, historic structure reports, building evaluation reports, scope development, construction management, and other architectural, engineering and technical services. The work will require primarily architectural, landscape architectural, interior design, mechanical, electrical, civil, structural services, and cost estimating, but may also necessitate geotechnical, traffic, environmental, fire safety, elevator, acoustical, lighting, signage and environmental graphics, historic preservation, construction management/inspection, surveyor and other disciplines with specialized experience. The selected A/E firms may be required to provide design services that include alternative energy, prefabrication or modular construction, and/or expedited design and delivery solutions.  The selected A/E firms may be required to participate in peer review processes. All facilities will be designed in metric units. There will be no limit on the amount paid on individual delivery orders and no limit on project size; however the total cumulative delivery order amount shall not exceed $12 million in any one contract period, and the minimum guaranteed contract amount is $1000 for the base year and each of the option years, if exercised. Firm-fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating firm-fixed price delivery orders. A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing delivery orders design services for projects with an estimate construction cost of less than $2 million will be included in the contract.

Perform Eligibility Verification for Point of Sale Facilitated Enrollment (POS FE)

INTRODUCTION

This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis in support of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Beneficiary Choices (CBC).  CMS is seeking capability statements from small and minority business firms (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that are qualified to support CMS as an Eligibility Contractor to provide a second-level verification of  the Medicaid eligibility of dual eligible and other low-income beneficiaries who have presented at the Point of Sale (POS) (i.e., at a pharmacy) with an immediate need for prescription drug coverage.  

Point of Sale Facilitated Enrollment (POS FE) refers to the process in which a National Prescription Drug Plan provides immediate drug coverage to certain full-benefit dual eligible, or other low-income subsidy (LIS) eligible individuals.  The individual presents to a pharmacist, who bills the claim in real time to the POS FE contractor.  The POS FE contractor has in place front end edits to confirm the person meets the initial criteria for claims payment (i.e., is Part D eligible and is not already enrolled in another Medicare Part D prescription drug plan).  At that point in time, the POS FE also determines whether the person has dual eligible or LIS status per CMS' systems.  If it is determined that the beneficiary is Part D eligible, not enrolled in a Part D plan, and is a full-benefit dual eligible or other LIS eligible, then the POS FE Contractor can adjudicate the claim at POS and immediately enroll the beneficiary into their PDP.  

If the POS FE Contractor determines the beneficiary is Part D eligible and not enrolled in a Part D plan, but CMS data cannot confirm Medicare or LIS status, the POS FE Contractor will pay the claim at POS until such eligibility can be confirmed.  The POS FE Contractor will request the Eligibility Contractor to verify Medicaid dual eligible status, and/or LIS eligibility status if available, for those whose eligibility status is unknown.  The Eligibility Contractor will then verify dual eligibility status with the appropriate state, and will then return data on their findings to the POS FE Contractor.  

The Eligibility Contractor will also submit data on eligible beneficiaries to CMS' Medicare Beneficiary Database (MBD), to ensure that the MBD reflects accurate LIS status.  For those whose eligibility status cannot be confirmed, the Eligibility Contractor will check CMS systems for LIS eligibility, as directed by CMS.  Those with LIS eligibility will be sent to the POS FE Contractor as eligible.  




 

HISTORY

On December 8, 2003 the President signed The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), authorizing a new Medicare Part D benefit that provides prescription drug insurance coverage to individuals who are entitled to Part A or enrolled in Part B.  Coverage began January 1, 2006.

The Part D benefit is being administered by private health plans.  That is, eligible individuals in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program may obtain the coverage through a stand-alone private PDP.  Those enrolled in private health plans under Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage (MA)) may only obtain drug coverage through plans (herein called MA-PD plans) offered through those MA organizations (with some exceptions).  

Full-benefit dual eligibles are individuals who are: 1) entitled to Part A or enrolled in Part B under Medicare; and 2) eligible for full Medicaid benefits.  Prior to the effective date of the MMA, Medicaid paid for most prescription drugs and Medicare paid for a very limited set of prescription drugs.  The MMA directed that Medicaid reimbursement for Part D covered prescription drugs end on December 31, 2005.  Commensurately, the MMA created Section 1860D-1(b)(1)(C) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and full Medicare coverage began on January 1, 2006, which directed that full-benefit dual eligibles who failed to enroll in a PDP or MA-PD plan be auto-enrolled in a PDP that had a monthly beneficiary premium that did not exceed the region-specific low-income  premium subsidy amount.  

Consistent with final regulations at 42 CFR 423.34, CMS has conducted Auto-Enrollment of full-benefit dual eligibles into PDPs since October 2005, and Facilitated Enrollment of other LIS eligibles into PDPs since March 2006. (Other LIS eligibles - means those who are deemed eligible by virtue of eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-only  (i.e., SSI and Medicare, but no Medicaid eligibility), or Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs, i.e. QMB-only, SLMB-only, or QI); as well as those who apply and are determined eligible by the Social Security Administration or their State Medicaid Agency.) CMS continues to make every effort to identify and auto-enroll all full-benefit dual eligibles, and identify and facilitate the enrollment of other low income subsidy (LIS) eligibles on a timely basis.  However, in the event of omission or error, a full-benefit dual eligible may not be auto-enrolled, or an LIS eligible may not be facilitated enrolled.  
   

TASK DESCRIPTION

Eligibility Verification

Under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) (formerly known as the SIC code): 541611 - (Size Standard: $6.5 million. Additional information on NAICS codes can be found at www.sba.gov), the Eligibility Contractor shall, in addition to providing all necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, supplies, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as required, verify eligibility for POS FE and LIS deeming for dual eligibles.  

This effort will include, but is not limited to, the following tasks:   

1.	The Eligibility Contractor shall establish the technical capability and develop the infrastructure for intake/receipt of cases, processing, and notification of denied facilitated enrollments.  The Eligibility Contractor shall: 
a.	Establish ability to query CMS' systems.   
b.	Obtain necessary Data Use Agreement (DUA) and obtain CMS user ID and password. 
c.	Establish secure connectivity as necessary (i.e., with MBD, the POS FE Contractor's systems, all 51 State EVS systems and other CMS systems as necessary).
d.	Establish policies and procedures and build systems requirements that comply with applicable privacy and data security laws.
e.	Establish policies and procedures and build systems requirements that comply with eligibility rules for intake, processing and reporting on facilitated enrollments and LIS deeming.
f.	Establish capability to send to and receive from CMS, standard data on those determined eligible for facilitated enrollment and LIS deeming.
g.	Begin testing with CMS and the POS FE Contractor, on information systems interfaces and data exchanges in time to permit successful implementation by January 1, 2008.
h.	Establish capability to store and retrieve facilitated enrollment data and LIS deeming data.
2.	The Eligibility Contractor shall establish the technical capability and develop the infrastructure for verifying Medicaid dual eligibility status.  The Eligibility Contractor shall establish query capability with State Medicaid Agencies in the 50 States and the District of Columbia, which should include EDI 270 query capability, and may include telephone or web-based individual queries, batch queries, or telephone contact with a live person. The preferred method for batch query is EDI.  The Eligibility Contractor shall establish alternative capability to verify Medicaid eligibility with State Medicaid Agencies in the 50 States and the District of Columbia.  For network connectivity and file transfer, the Eligibility Contractor will need to establish a direct connection between the contractor and CMS.
3.	The Eligibility Contractor shall establish connectivity with the POS FE Contractor in order to receive data on a daily basis on beneficiaries for whom claims were submitted by a pharmacy as dual eligibles or other LIS eligibles, who did not have Part D plan enrollment in the service month of the date of service, and presented with a prescription drug need.
4.  The Eligibility Contractor shall determine if a beneficiary qualifies for POS FE.
a.	The Eligibility Contractor shall obtain sufficient information about the beneficiary from the POS FE Contractor to verify dual eligibility status and eligibility for POS FE or LIS, respectively, including name, date of birth, state of residence, mailing address, state in which she/he has Medicaid, Medicaid ID number, SSN, DOB, gender code, and HICN/RRB number.
b.	For each beneficiary submitted by the POS FE Contractor, the Eligibility Contractor shall verify Medicaid eligibility with the state of residence for the month of the date of service by querying State systems.  For those who cannot be found to be eligible through State systems, the Eligibility Contractor will query CMS' systems for Medicaid or LIS eligibility for the service month.
c.	In the event that the data elements specified in 4a are not provided, or appear to conflict with existing data (i.e., from the state), the Eligibility Contractor shall verify such data elements in the MBD, and return any discrepancies to the POS FE Contractor.
d.	The Eligibility Contractor shall verify dual eligibility of the beneficiary, and return data to the POS FE Contractor either confirming or denying that individual's eligibility for the POS FE process within 3 business days of the receipt of the data for 95% of beneficiaries, and within 6 business days for 99% of beneficiaries.
5.	The Eligibility Contractor shall submit data on all beneficiaries found to be eligible for Medicaid from the POS FE Contractor to CMS, on a schedule to be determined by CMS (but on no less than a monthly basis) for inclusion in the LIS Deeming Process.  The LIS Deeming file shall be submitted in a format to be determined by CMS.
A. REQUIRED DEMONSTRATED KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE, OR THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE 

1)	Demonstrated specialized knowledge and an operational understanding of Section 101 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA).  
2)	Provide both sufficient personnel and appropriately skilled professionals.  Staff should be experienced in establishing secure connections to query multiple systems, as this contract requires connectivity with 51 State Medicaid Agencies' Eligibility Verification Systems, including securing the necessary data use agreements and testing access to each.  Staff should be skilled at interpreting data from multiple entities, especially in situations in which each system defines the same information with different types of data.  Staff should also be experienced with conducting frequent and accurate data exchanges with multiple entities. 
3)	Ability to secure locations in which to maintain and store confidential and proprietary information (i.e., paper and electronic versions) and ability to shred confidential documents as instructed by CMS.
4)	Maintaining and storing electronic data in a HIPAA-compliant environment throughout and after the conclusion of the project.
5)	Specific corporate experience directly related to our requirements; include references (point of contact and phone number).

<SUBJECT>U -- Additional Instructor Contact Hours
<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department,  Philadelphia Office, intends to contract with San Diego City College (SDCC) for additional instructor contact hours in support of the Navy's Training Support Center (TSC) San Diego.  SDCC is currently under contract to provide a wide variety of training to several Navy learning centers that are supported by TSC San Diego.  The additional instructor contact hours will mainly support the Navy's Center for Naval Engineering.  The additional instructor contact hours will support instruction that includes several high risk courses, such as Shipboard Aircraft Firefighting and Advanced Shipboard Firefighting.  Further, the contractor shall award college credits to Navy students for the courses taught. The additional contract quantities are required due to the unforeseen loss of military instructors due to budget reductions and unplanned military instructor augments to Iraq and Afghanistan.   The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SDCC for this requirement for additional instructor contact hours.  This firm is considered the only source capable of providing services which meet all of the Navy's requirements by 1 October 2007 as they are the current contractor responsible for all contractor-provided training in support of TSC San Diego.  SDCC is the only source with qualified and certified instructors for the required courses in place in order to provide the additional quantities by 1 October 2007.  Further, SDCC has articulated the courses and is the only source ready to provide the required college credits by 1 October 2007.  In addition, it would not be functionally possible to segregate the additionally required quantities from the delivery of the existing services.  It is not feasible to have a different contractor sharing the same classrooms, lab facilities, and training equipment that is already being used by SDCC.  It would also not be feasible for a different contractor to use training equipment that SDCC is currently responsible to maintain.  Further, cross-training of instructors in other courses already supported by the existing contract quantities is required.  It would not be feasible to cross-train any other contractor's instructors in courses that are covered by current contract quantities.  Interested parties may identify their interest and prove their capability to respond to this requirement for additional services.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received within forty-five (45) days after date of this notice will be considered by the Government. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information received.

<SUBJECT>B -- NATO Market Survey and Workshop in Support of the Functional Services for Logistics C2 (LOG FS) Consolidation Phase Project
<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) is currently initiating Project OIS 3042 (Consolidate Existing Logistics Systems to Provide LOG FS IOC) under the Functional Services for Logistics C2 (LOG FS) Capability Package. This project is intended to provide an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) of the LOG FS as a fully integrated component of the Bi-Strategic Command Automated Information System (Bi-SC AIS) and to serve as a baseline for further development.

In support of the project initiation, NC3A has undertaken two initiatives with the purpose of gathering information from governmental organizations and industry in support of the development of a suitable acquisition strategy. The first initiative is to conduct a Market Survey to gather information to benefit from industry expertise and experience to consolidate the project approach. The second initiative consists in organizing a Workshop in order to collect information about lessons learned and experience gained in the recent implementation of similar projects.

The information collected as a result of these initiatives will help NC3A to further develop and improve the project TBCE, particularly with respect to project approach and risk identification and mitigation.

MARKET SURVEY

The Market Survey package will provide the necessary information and instruction for those firms interested in participating in the survey. It includes information and instructions for participation, an overview of the project, and the Bi-SC AIS LOG FS Consolidation Project Market Survey questionnaire. The package also provides a list of topics of interest that should help attendees in preparing presentations for the Workshop. 

Firms are invited to participate in the Market Survey to support the Bi-SC AIS LOG FS Consolidation Phase project. Only firms that have completed the Market Survey will be invited to participate in the Workshop. To obtain a copy of the Market Survey package, please send an email request to lcarpent@bis.doc.gov  

The completed Market Survey must be submitted to NC3A not later than Close of Business 07 September 2007. Instructions for submitting the Market Survey to NC3A will be included in the Market Survey package. 

WORKSHOP

The LOG FS Consolidation phase Project Workshop is planned to take place in the third week of October 2007 (15-19 October) in Brussels. Attendees will include stakeholders from a number of NATO military headquarters and agencies, NC3A project staff, and representatives from those firms that have participated in the Market Survey. 

Participation in the Workshop entails presenting recent and relevant experiences and lessons learned regarding the implementation of projects similar in scope and complexity to the LGO FS Consolidation Phase Project.

Participation in the Market Survey or in the Workshop is not directly tied to any future solicitations under this project. The main objective of the Workshop is to ensure that, for the sake of effectiveness, valuable national experience regarding the implementation of similar projects is taken into account. 

This announcement is not a Notification of Intent to Call for Bids. Furthermore, any prospective participant who declines to respond to the Market Survey will not be prevented from taking part in the subsequent competitive bidding process, if declared eligible to do so.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Upgrade of the Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer into a Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration?s (NOAA) Chemical Sciences Division (CSD) of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Aerodyne Research, Inc. located at 45 Manning Road, Billerica, MA  01821-3976, for an upgrade of the Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer detector on the NOAA/CSD Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer to a Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer detector.  The Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (ToF-MS) detector will improve the performance of existing equipment to have 10-second detection limits of less than 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter for sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organic aerosol mass and other non-refractory aerosol components.  This detector is also capable of obtaining mass distributions as a function of size as well as single particle mass spectra for particles larger than about 200 nm.    
A significant requirement of this acquisition is that it must be physically compatible with the existing equipment (the Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer) and must generate ASCII or hierarchical data format files with the ToF-AMS data acquisition software v. 2.1.0 that can be analyzed with HeiDI (Hierarchical Data from Igor) v.1.2.1 and/or SQUIRREL (SeQUential Igor data RetRiEvaL) v.1.41 software.  In the ion source of the requested detector, focused particles must be vaporized at a controlled temperature from 200 to 900 C and the resulting vapors ionized with electron impact ionization.  The position of this ion source must match the position of the focused particles in the existing equipment.  The ions formed are extracted and pulsed into the requested time-of-flight mass spectrometer detector to obtain a complete mass spectrum up to 300 amu with a mass resolution of 800 every 13-15 ms.  Several features of data acquisition are user defined, including signal thresholds, timing parameters, and the number of spectra coadded for saving onto the computer.  Particle size is measured by the combined timing of particle pulses near the inlet of the existing equipment with signals from the time-of-flight mass spectrometer detector.  The size of the detector must be smaller than 5? wide, 8? high, and 11? long to fit on the existing equipment within NOAA research aircraft.  Together, the detector, power supply, microchannel plate, 1GHz data acquisition card, chamber, vaporization and ion source assembly, ion pulsing electronics, cabling, and associated computer must weigh less than 110 lbs.

This acquisition will replace another less sensitive detector, the quadrupole mass spectrometer detector, that was supplied with the Aerosol Mass Spectrometer previously purchased from Aerodyne Research Inc. in 2002. Included with the new ToF-MS detector are the power supply, a microchannel plate, 1GHz data acquisition card, port for differential pumping, vaporization and ion source assembly, ion pulsing electronics, and associated computer.  The updated detector is required to come with at least a one-year warranty.  

This is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received in response to this notice will be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties who believe they can meet the agency?s requirements are requested to submit, in writing, an affirmative response demonstrating their technical capabilities.  To be considered an affirmative response, the response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the stated requirements.  Interested parties must address each of the mandatory requirements listed in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet requirements.  Failure to submit documentation will result in the agency proceeding as stated above.  All affirmative responses shall be received by 4:00 P.M., Mountain Standard Time, on August 28, 2007 to Susan.Labovitz@noaa.gov.

BACKGROUND:   The Chemical Sciences Division of NOAA?s Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ ESRL/ CSD) has undertaken laboratory and field studies aimed at understanding aerosol formation and redistribution in the atmosphere.  Knowledge of aerosol properties and sources are needed to evaluate and manage a wide variety of air quality concerns.  These include the concentrations and physical and chemical properties of these particles and how these properties affect human health, atmospheric visibility, and climate change. 

To advance this research CSD acquired an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer that was delivered in May 2002. The instrument has been successfully used in a variety of field and laboratory studies aimed at understanding aerosol properties.  However, the sensitivity of this instrument is insufficient for airborne studies aboard NOAA research aircraft, where rapid time response in narrow pollution plumes and low detection limits in remote environments and the free troposphere are needed.  The 10-minute detection limits for inorganic (sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium) and organic aerosol components of the current system are between 0.1 and 0.6 micrograms per cubic meter of air, depending on the species measured.  For aircraft flying at a speed of 100 meters per second, 10 minutes of sampling time corresponds to a distance of 60 km, which provides insufficient resolution to meet all of CSD?s research objectives.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contract to be negotiated allows for a 124 calendar day delivery.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to International Sports Properties. This company's physical address is 140 Club Oaks Court, Winston Salem, NC, 27104-4680. The award will be made for the purchase of a advertisin g package market ing the Tennessee Army National Guard. This marketing effort will concentrate on marketing activities with Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee during the 2007 football season. This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 6.302-1, for  Other t han Full and Open Competition and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to USPFO for Tennessee Contracting Division Attn: Major John W. Anders, PO Box 41502 Nashville, Tennessee, 37204, or sent by email to john.anders@ng.army.mil . Te lephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted. Responses to this notice must be submitted by 3:30 PM CST, Friday, August 17, 2007. A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.  The point of contact for this announcement is John Anders, Contract Specialist, at john.anders@ng.army.mil.  1.  This request for justification for other than full and open competition is for an on-site advertising package for the University of Vanderbilt s Football program.  The recommended vendor to fulfill this requirement is the company of, International Sports Properties, Incorporated.  This company is under contract with Vanderbilt University for marketing activities for the 2007 football season.  The  Tennessee Army National Guard would like to use this company to market them during the home games for the 2007 football season.  This kind of concept for this particular venue is not otherwise available to the Government. 2.	In an effort to increase the number of people enlisting in the  Tennessee National Army Guard (TNARNG) on a game day representatives from the TNARNG shall be allowed to set up a Game Day display in order to educate spectators about the opportunities ava ilable in the Tennessee Army National Guard  3.	The total estimated value of this advertising package shall not exceed $7,500.00. 4.	The Statutory Authority as noted in the Federal Acquisition Regulation part 6.302-1 is satisfied based on the fact that there is only one responsible source for fulfilling this requirement in the vicinity of Nashville, Tennessee, and that there are no o ther supplies or services that will satisfy the agency requirements for this particular requirement.  5.	Vanderbilt University is considered by the general population of Nashville that Vanderbilt University is the largest collegiate football team in Nashville, Tennessee and is the only sports organization in the area with the potential to provide an advert ising media capable of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic group that the Tennessee Army National Guard wishes to recruit.  6.	Efforts to solicit other contractors have not been made as the University of Memphis is the only collegiate team in the West Tennessee for this particular venue capable of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic group that the Tennessee  Army National Guard wishes to recruit. 7.	The anticipated cost of this acquisition is determined fair and reasonable by comparison of prices proposed in other advertisement packages of this nature. The price proposed for the advertisement and marketing efforts with Vanderbilt University is $7,5 00.00.  8.	Efforts were made to identify other sources of competition by searching for vendors registered under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541890 for Display Advertising in Tennessee. No other sports teams in the Middle Tenne ssee area were identified in this search that coul d provide an advertisement package as required for this particular requirement except for, International Sports Properties, Incorporated. 9.	International Sports Properties, Incorporated is the only responsible source identified in the market research that could provide an advertising package of this type in the Middle Tennessee area.  10.	Based upon the market research conducted by this office there were no other sources that could have expressed an interest in this acquisition. 11.	No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken, as the University of Memphis is only collegiate basketball team in West Tennessee who can provide advertising to potentially reach the desired number of people in the demographic group for pot ential recruits into the Tennessee Army National Guard. 12.	This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS (Attachment 1)

SUBJECT:  Brand Name Procurement (AM General 6.5 L Diesel Engine)

FINDINGS

1.  In accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for ?brand name? only. Also,  IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13 (see above). Dollar amount on requirement does not expect to exceed the SAT.

2.  IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. To re-manufacture another equivalent (in performance) engine to fit the M1116 HMMWVs, a specific conversion kit would be required and would require excess costs by the contractor. In addition, due to the uniqueness of the HMMWVs (upright design, unlike most commercial Hummers), specifying the brand name of the engine is crucial to the Government in order to meet its needs.

4.  Rear mounted turbos for 6.5L Diesel Automobile engines are only obtainable by the AM General brand. A side mounted turbo will not be serviceable to the mission. 

DETERMINATION

Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement of AM General 6.5L Turbo (rear mounted) Diesel Engine is in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order for the equipment listed below. The requirement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5. 

(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

(ii) The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-07-00388. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). 

(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-18, July 5, 2007. 

(iv) The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516.   

(v) The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting for the following equipment:

SpectraMax M2e Microplate Fluorescence and Absorbance:

Performance Specifications:

 (1) Must be a dual monochromator-based system with Top and Bottom reading capacity for dual mode (Fluorescence & Absorbance), in 1cm cuvette port and in 6- to 384- well microplate.

 (2) Must have Dual monochromators for tunable fluorescence wavelength selection between 250 nm and 850 nm for emission wavelengths.

 (3) Must have Tunable absorbance wavelength selection between 200 nm and 1000 nm. No wavelength filters are required for purchase in the future when additional assays are added to laboratory.

 (4) Must have agitation and Temperature control from Ambient +4C up to 45C

 (5) Must read up to four EX/EM wavelength pairs per microplate for multi-fluorophore assay design.

 (6) Must have fixed fluorescence spectral bandwidth of 9 nm for improved resolution between EX/EM components. Narrow bandwidth is critical when designing multi-fluorophore assays or when using narrow Stokes shift fluorophores.

 (7) Must have a fixed absorbance bandwidth of less or equal to 4 nm.

 (8) Must have full wavelength scanning capability across the entire spectral range for defining actual EX and EM maxima. Can perform spectral scans in user-defined increments as small as 1 nm, and then can select assay wavelengths for actual maxima. It does increase sensitivity for assay by working at actual conditions rather than using literature references.

 (9) Must have Automatic PMT setting adjusts the optimum voltage for each well sample concentration and then normalizes the raw data to show RFU values. Wells are selectively reread at the optimal PMT setting. Photo-bleaching is eliminated because wells are not illuminated unnecessarily.

(10) Must have Patented PathCheck sensor-the only sensor of its kind not affected by temperature, and requires no accessories to measure the pathlength of the sample in all individual microplate well. The pathlength measurement can be used to calculate concentrations without a standard curve, test liquid handling devices, detect and correct for pipetting errors, and expand the dynamic range of the assay.

An official authorized to bind the Offeror must sign the terms and conditions of the offer.  Offerors that fail to furnish required representations and certifications, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation, may be excluded from consideration.

(vi) Contract type: Commercial Item - Firm fixed price.  Simplified procurement procedures will be utilized.  

(vii) FOB Point Destination.  To be delivered by September 29, 2007 to the Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave, Silver Springs, MD 20993.

(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.  The following addenda have been attached to this provision: None.


(ix) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000). This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-17.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Quotes (RFQ) number is NB853000-7-13091SRG.  The proposed procurement is Open Market, Total Small Business set aside.  NAICS Code:  333319.  Small Business Size Standard: 500 Employees. 
************
PURPOSE: The NOAA Acquisition & Grant Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, is purchasing a high capacity Charpy impact machine in the (700 J) for use as a reference machine in the Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Charpy program.  
************
MISSION:  The machine will be used to certify the absorbed energy of NIST ultra-high energy SRM's, for the indirect verification of machines testing at 300 J or more. 
************
BACKGROUND:  As steel manufactures continue to improve the quality of their products (through alloy design and better refining processes), the impact toughness continues to improve.  In turn, the Charpy impact machine manufactures are introducing new models with capacities appropriate for these new higher-energy steels.  NIST?s current Charpy SRM products need to be expanded (by addition of a higher energy range) to accurately assess the performance of these ultra-high capacity machines (500 J and higher). NIST will purchase a new Charpy impact machine with a capacity near 700 J in FY 07.  This new Charpy must provide results that compare well with NIST?s existing reference machine, 700 J.  
************
REQUIREMENTS: NIST requires a Pendulum (Charpy) Impact Test Machine with a maximum capacity of between 700 and 800 joules.   The machine shall be suitable for use as a reference machine, according to ASTM 23 and ISO 148 standards.  It will be used in a laboratory that certifies indirect impact verification specimens.  This machine will be used to certify the absorbed energy of NIST ultra-high energy Standard Reference Materials) SRM's, for the indirect verification of machines testing at 300 J or more.   The Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) requirements are listed in four sections.  
************
This machine upon installation by NIST will be verified to meet the following qualifying requirements:  1. The difference between the absorbed energy given by the optical encoder and that calculated for an instrumented test shall be minimized by test machine design (rather than by numerical correction).  NIST will require demonstration data and literature for the machine purchased (or an identical machine) to verify that this requirement is met using NIST SRM specimen (provided at no cost for the testing).  2.  All direct verification requirements in ASTM E23 and ISO 148-2 for reference impact machines shall be exceeded.  3. The indirect performance of the machine shall be evaluated using NIST SRM?s at low, high, and super-high energy levels.  The results for low energy tests shall consistently be within 1.4 J of the result for NIST?s 360 J Tokyo Koki reference machine on the same samples.  The Tokyo Koki machine sets a lower bound for the performance of the NIST reference machines, so the machine NIST purchases must agree with the Tokyo Koki within the maximum tolerance specified.  Results at the high and super-high levels shall be within 5% of the certified value for the SRM tested.  NIST can work with potential bidders to help them evaluate how well they might meet these criteria (prior to bidding). 
************
The Section One has the actual requirements of the Pendulum Impact Test Machine.   The Section Two is options for upgrades to be priced out separately.  The Section Three is options that may be included for this purchase, but can be priced out separately for NIST?s information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented, with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-18, effective on June 30, 2007.  This announcement is considered an unrestricted procurement. The NAICS Code is 541611. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ No. 07-0152), and is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.6, Acquisition of Commercial Items and Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The EEOC contemplates the award of a Firm-Fixed price type contract for Consulting Services for the National Contact Center (NCC) Migration Functional Requirements Analysis, Cost Estimates and Implementation Plan. Period of performance will be from date of award up through six (6) months thereafter.  The overall total period of performance shall not exceed six months. Background:  The EEOC is responsible for enforcing laws prohibiting discrimination in the workplace because of a person's race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age (40 and over), and/or disability.  The specific laws EEOC enforces include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, sections of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  EEOC works with various Fair Employment Practices Agencies at the state and local level, and the Department of Justice in carrying out the mandates of these laws.  Further, the EEOC has Memoranda of Understanding with several agencies including the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs and Wage and Hour Division, the Department of Education and the National Labor Relations Board that relate to the handling of workplace-related discrimination issues. A two-year pilot for a national contact center was implemented in 2004 by contractor Vangent, Inc. (formerly Pearson Government Solutions, Inc).  The objectives were to improve customer service and customer access to the EEOC using state-of-the-art technology and industry best practices; improve human capital effectiveness; and deliver accurate and consistent services to our customers throughout the nation. More than 70,000 people call the NCC's toll-free number each month while over 3000 send emails to the NCC.  At least 35 percent of the calls are resolved by the interactive voice response (IVR) system while  the remaining calls are answered by trained Customer Services Representatives (CSR) with less than one minute wait time on average, well within the recommended service level for federal government call centers.  Questionnaires are mailed to more than 14,000 individuals each month within 7 business days of the call.  Both headquarters and field staff have monitored the quality of the calls and attest to their accuracy and professionalism.  Callers have been assisted in more than 30 languages under a contract that offers language interpretation services in more than 150 languages. At this time, the EEOC seeks to migrate the NCC from a centralized model in a single facility to an in-house environment staffed by federal employees using a decentralized model with locations within each of the EEOC's fifteen Districts.  In order to properly carry out this migration effort, the EEOC requires a contractor to prepare a functional requirements analysis, cost estimates and implementation plan as well as to advise and assist on all activities and functionalities relevant to developing and implementing an insourced model in 15 various locations throughout the United States.  Scope:  The EEOC requires a contractor to provide cost estimates, migration time estimates, and necessary steps for providing the services the NCC currently offers (IVR, language interpretation service, answering calls for first time callers, providing general information regarding the EEOC and the statutes it enforces, providing information regarding charges filed with the EEOC, performing a preliminary screen of callers, making referrals to other agencies where appropriate, sending out intake questionnaires where appropriate) within EEOC covering both the business and technical components and using market data and industry standards for best practices.  The goal of this migration is to have EEOC able to answer its incoming calls and emails using IVR, CRM software application (RightNow), and EEOC employees. The EEOC is willing to consider plans that assume comparable staffing, processes, technology and equipment as currently in use at the National Contact Center in Lawrence, KS.  Likewise, the EEOC will consider options that differ from the staffing, processes, technology and equipment currently used in the National Contact Center in Lawrence, KS that the contractor believes would be of better or equal value for the EEOC to the extent the technology and equipment options do not conflict with the provisions regarding the transition of current Internet based information services as required under this Scope.  Staffing plans should include a minimum of 45 FTE as information/intake representatives to answer calls and emails. Contractor estimates should use current EEOC resources-where appropriate. The EEOC requires a contractor who can provide consulting services to advise and assist in the transition from a contractor-operated contact center to an in-house operation and will work with the EEOC to develop and implement an in-house call and email answering function utilizing federal employees to manage the operation and as information/intake representatives.  The transition plan should include at least five defined phases:  planning (including site selection recommendations), defining requirements, buildout of space (as necessary), training and deploying staff, and operation. The planning phase should include plans for transition/migration, staffing, establishing and managing service levels, quality assurance monitoring and reporting, appropriate systems and technology, disaster recovery, and center management.  The contractor shall provide technical and functional solutions to facilitate implementation of the in-house operation at the 15 recommended locations. The contractor will advise on the transition of current Internet-based information services including the 60 CRM software application (RightNow) licenses currently owned by EEOC, call center capabilities including the Intervoice Brite IVR server currently owned by EEOC, and appropriate knowledge management database already developed by EEOC and information technologies into a 15-location operation dedicated to answering calls, emails, and disseminating information to EEOC's customers.  The contractor shall provide advice and assistance in transitioning the IVR and CRM technology and software, currently owned by EEOC, to an in-house environment.  Specifically, the EEOC expects the contractor to provide a full range of services related to:   Project planning to accomplish the successful implementation, operation and management of an internal call and email answering function in 15 locations;  Technical planning, data gathering, data analysis and analysis of call volumes, estimated talk times, steady state and peak contact periods, planning to handle variable contact volume without adversely affecting customer service, development and integration of emerging technology, staffing, training, security, etc.; Advice on a management plan for day-to-day operation of the in-house operation; Advice and assistance in providing a complete in-house solution to support customer service needs and; Advice and assistance in providing a complete, integrated package of quality and productivity programs that includes: 1. Quality monitoring capabilities with analysis of both call data and agent performance. Monitoring must include the ability to perform both on-site and from a remote location; 2. Workforce management tools for both scheduling and forecasting staff schedules; 3.  Customer contact/management/scripting software that enables online data capture regarding call/caller and whether the call was completed during the original contact.  Please note EEOC currently owns 60 licenses for a hosted CRM software solution (RightNow); 4.  Providing user interfaces for real-time reporting and program modifications of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) paths, call paths, agent skill sets and performance to ensure that program goals are attained;  5.  Providing for tracking of calls and emails, call durations and routing data and ensuring consistency with EEOC performance measurement goals and; 6.  Providing clear, consistent, accurate, timely, authoritative and complete information.  The in-house solution must provide for, at a minimum, a disaster recovery down time of no more than forty-eight (48) hours, statistic reporting capabilities, and the ability to interface with several of the EEOC's information technology systems.  It must allow for future expansion and technological improvement and growth.  Initial components include Private Branch Exchange (PBX)/Automatic Call Distributor (ACD), Interactive Voice Response (IVR) with speech recognition in both English and Spanish, call accounting systems and agent data recording systems.  The proposed system shall have the capacity to provide Internet Protocol technology and language interpretation service to EEOC customers.  As an optional feature, EEOC is interested in a system to support information/intake representatives handling calls from home or an alternate work site, offering the equivalent training, functionality, reporting measurements, and security as information/intake representatives located in the EEOC facilities. Assumptions:  Federal employees will be used to staff the operations in EEOC offices which are in Government leased space (federal or commercial) and with Government furnished or leased equipment.  The Government furnished equipment includes the IVR and the CRM software application (RightNow) in use at the NCC and the outputs from the system (reports) that are useful to EEOC. Deliverables: The deliverables for this study are:
 
CLIN 0001:  $ _________ A written analysis of the functional requirements, cost, migration time, and necessary steps to transition the operations and services of  the National Contact Center to an in-house environment at EEOC using a decentralized model operating in 15 districts.

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION ? COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror or offerors using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Quotations shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis. If a quotation has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.   In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorable on past performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go basis.  If a quotation has been determined acceptable ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation, and who has either been found to have a satisfactory past performance history, no relevant past performance history, or for whom no past performance information is available, will then have its quotation evaluated for the lowest price.

1.  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of  descriptive literature and any other information required to clearly indicate that the offeror is proposing and will be providing the straight line rip in accordance with all stated characteristics located in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.  

?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quotation.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the product which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

2.  Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quotation will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

In evaluating an offeror?s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror?s quotation and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products under an indefinite delivery type arrangement.  

The offeror shall provide: 
a.	A list of contracts, preferably three, commercial or government that have been performed within the last five (5) years.  This list shall include:  point of contact, address, telephone 
number, dollar amount of contract, performance schedule and a brief description of the services provided.

Evaluation of Quality:

By quality, the Government means how well the offeror conformed to specifications and to standards of good workmanship. Evaluation of quality will be a subjective assessment. It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable quality.  This is a matter of judgment.  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address especially unfavorable reports of quality, and the offeror??s response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration.

Quality will be rated on an adjectival scale.  The Government??s conclusions about the overall quality will be a factor in determining the relative merits of the offeror??s proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered the most advantageous to the Government. The Government wants displays that look professional and make an impression.

Evaluation of Delivery Timeframe:

The total amount of time for completion of this contract will be evaluated, with a shorter timeframe preferred. Timeframes will not be ranked, but will be used in conjunction with the other factors to determine the proposal which represents the best value to the Government.

Evaluation of Price:

The offered price will be used in conjunction with the other factors to determine the proposal which represents the best value to the Government.

<CONTACT>Mary Carver Contracting Officer 7039643683     Mary.Carver@mms.gov;
<DESC>RFQ 67950  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS General Questions 1. Is there an incumbent currently providing the requested services or any portion thereof?  No  If so, who is the incumbent? N/A 2.  The first paragraph of the Request For Quote letter indicates that proposal must be submitted via email; in the closing sections of the Request For Quote letter bidders are provided with the proposal submittal address.  Will other than email submitted proposals be accepted?  Yes, you may submit proposals on CD plus one copy by the stated due date and time.    3.  Has the government produced an independent cost estimate and/or estimated level of effort, and if so, what are the results of this effort?   Yes, the government has an estimated level of effort of 14,000 to 18,000 man hours for this 36 months effort.     Questions on the RFQ letter Proposal Volume 1A- Technical 1.  Comment: The Govt has requested that bidders provide an organizational chart that includes the proposed resource head count required to perform these services. It further states that bidders are required to identify roles/responsibilities for each role. a. What is the definition of the term "each role."  Are roles bounded by discreet functions that may be accomplished by one or many individuals in the organization, or is each role discreetly bounded by a single head count included in the submitted organizational chart?   A person's title in the organizational chart may be different from the labor category proposed.  So please provide a labor category description for each individual proposed.   b.   The Govt has requested that bidders provide management methods and processes for "all types of support activities."   Can support activities be better defined so that bidders will have a clearer understanding of the information requirement?  Provide only support activities that are relevant to this effort, so to demonstrate an understanding of this requirement in your proposal.   2.  Will a contractor's standard format for submission of Management and Status Reports be acceptable or is there an approved customer format that must be utilized by contractors? A format will be agreed upon at the Orientation briefing.   Questions on the RFQ letter Proposal Volume 2- Price Quote 1.  The RFQ states that the resultant contract will be a Firm Fixed Price arrangement with actual travel costs reimbursed per the JTR. The RFP further requests that bidders provide labor categories, skills/experience per category, proposed hourly rates per category (fully burdened including profit), and a payment schedule based on completion of work products. The SOW defines only one deliverable at the conclusion of the contract period of performance.   If bidders are to provide their defined payment schedule with FFP values and performance due dates, can bidders reasonably expect that this submittal with the proposal will become CLINs in the resultant contract?   Offerors may propose a pricing and CLIN structure to demonstrate their understanding of the requirement.

INTRODUCTION 
NOTE: This release of the EMSEC and COMSEC-approved ABKVM switches document incorporates the information contained in Emission Security Information Message (ESIM) 06-01. See page 8 for details. 
1. A/B switches are switches to allow the sharing of peripheral devices between classified and unclassified signal wire lines. There are two types of switching: mechanical or manual/physical (more common) and software or ?smart? switching. The most common switch is used to share one keyboard, video monitor, and mouse (KVM) between a classified central processing unit (CPU) and an unclassified CPU, commonly referred to as a KVM switch. Other A/B switches are used to share output resources, for example printers and video display screens. 
2. All users must first consider using the devices from the approved Defense Information Systems Network [DISN] Security Accreditation product list in Part II. Once the approved product which meets their specific requirements is selected, customers will work with their respective enclave/Local designated approval authority (DAA) to submit an updated System Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA-DITSCAP) to the SIRPNET Connection Approval Office (SCAO). 
This document will reflect the addition of the device on the user?s enclave and an updated SIPRNet Connection Questionnaire (SCQ) must be submitted to the SCAO reflecting the device on the user?s enclave, prior to connecting the device to the DISN (e.g. SIPRNET). 
3. If the switch under consideration is not listed on the approved list, it must go through a technical evaluation by a competent authority (NSA, DIA, CTTA, or certified testing facility) and receive favorable comments from the DISN Security Accreditation Working Group (DSAWG). The DSAWG approval process is initiated by the customer by contacting HQ AFCA/EVPI for a cross domain solution (CDS) ticket or goes to the following web site https://private.afca.af.mil/ip/info_services/compusec_sec.cfm?COMPID=14. As an advocate for Air Force customers, AFCA/EVPI will notify their NSA Customer Advocate for assistance in getting the product evaluated. 
a. If the product has been tested by a certified testing facility, has a user?s CONOP/SOP defining the installation, operation, and security procedures that have been implemented, the SIPRNET Connection Approval Authority (SCAO) can present it straight to the DSAWG for review and approval working in tandem with the Air Force Cross Domain Requirements Office (AFCA/EA3). Lead time for this process is typically four months. 
b. However, if the device has not had an evaluation or is a "smart" or electronic type device (power is provided to the unit for operation or it has some internal memory/ circuitry), a cross domain solution (formerly SABI) ticket must be initiated through AFCA/EA3. Getting the device tested and approved may take anywhere between 12-18 months, depending on workload. 
For guidance on the evaluation criteria for peripheral sharing devices, see reference NSA?s ?Peripheral Sharing Switch (PSS) for Human Interface Devices ? Protection Profile?, dated 15 March 2000, http://niap.nist.gov/cc-scheme/pp/PP_PSSHIDPP_V1.0.pdf
4. Part I, COMSEC and EMSEC Rules for A/B Switches, defines the criteria that any PSS switch must meet for usage. This means that any A/B switch may be approved for use if it meets the electrical and isolation requirements and is installed meeting the installation requirements. 
5. Part II, Approved A/B Switches, is a listing of Air Force approved mechanical A/B switches. These A/B switches have been evaluated by DISA. HQ AFCA is working with the DSAWG to add the NSA-approved switches to the DSAWG-approved switches listing. 
6. PART III, Common Criteria Validated Switches, lists switches have been evaluated and validated in accordance with the provisions of the NIAP Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme and the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA). The CYBEX/Avocent switches appearing in Part II have also been Common Criteria validated. 
7. PART IV, AF-CTTA Approved Switches, is a listing of switches reviewed and approved for use by the Air Force CTTA. Testing has been done by other approved organizations or the design and use of these switches pose a low EMSEC risk. However, prior to installing and using these switches, submit detailed approval requests to the AF-CTTA for further recommendations.
PART I 
COMSEC and EMSEC Rules for A/B Switches 
There are two requirements any A/B switch must meet: installation and electrical/isolation criteria. 
1. Installation Criteria for PSS 
1.2. The actual switching must be by a mechanical switch. Push button control is permitted. 
1.3. The switch must not allow a common ground between the classified CPU signal wires and the unclassified CPU signal wires. 
1.4. The signal line connected between the unclassified CPU to the first router, server, or hub must be 20 meters in length and must stay within the controlled access area. 
1.5. If input cables from the classified and unclassified CPUs are shielded, the shields must be isolated from each other. Each may be in common with the shield of the output when selected by the switch but not both at the same time. 
1.6. If RED power is required for the classified system, an A/B switch requiring power cannot be used. 
2. Electrical/Isolation Criteria for PSS 
2.1. The switch must offer a minimum of 60 decibels (dB) of isolation (between 0 and 1 gigahertz). (Use manufacturer specifications or formal test methods.)
PART II 
APPROVED A/B SWITCHES 
Introduction. Below are switches tested by DISA and approved by the DSAWG. If any A/B switch listed here meets a user?s requirement, it is approved for use. HQ AFCA is working with the DSAWG to add the NSA-approved switches to the DSAWG-approved switches listing. They include switches from Hetra, Raritan, Market Central, OMNI boxes. Prices shown are approximate and current as of February 2007, but cost may be affected by quantity purchased or individual requirements. 
Configuration guidance. Security documentation (i.e., CONOP, SOP or updated SSAA) must be submitted to the SCAO before connection will be approved. Documentation must include evidence that: 
- The device is located in a secure controlled environment 
- The device is physically secured with tamper tape 
- Static IP?s have been assigned to the hard drives 
- Subnet mask is different for each network 
- Screen savers are different for the connected networks 
- Different passwords are used for the connected networks 
- Domain names are different 
- Audit loges will be review for failed log-in attempts

DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES 
Following items will be provided: 
CLIN: 0001; Description: Exhibit booth space (8? x 10?); Quantity:  Twenty-three (23) 
Period of Performance:  24 September 2007 through 26 September 2007. Place of Performance Marriott Wardman Park Hotel, Washington, DC. 20008

JUSTIFICATION
The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract on a Limited Source basis to acquire 23 exhibit display booths AFMA/RM.  The Marriott Wardman Park Hotel and the Omni Sheraton Hotel have been selected to host this year?s CSTEA participants.  The CSTEA has been scheduled for September 19-27, 2007.  Part of the CSTEA plan calls for exhibition displays, a ceremony, and a reception.  As participants in the CSTEA program, twenty-three (23) competing CSTEA teams are required to set up exhibition display booths to network and dialogue on their process improvements.  The Air Force Association (AFA) has selected the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel to host the AFA National Convention.  In the Government?s better interest, market research conducted by AFMA supports a determination made by the planning committee to hold the exhibitions, ceremony, and reception portion of the CSTEA program in the same facility where the awards and convention activities are scheduled to take place.  The AFA has leased the entire Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for September 24 ? 27, 2007 and has designated areas for exhibitions to be held during the convention at the Hotel.  During CSTEA 2007, the AFA is the office of primary responsibility for setting up the AFA National Convention and the sole source for the rental of all areas within the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel.   The CSTEA planning committee recommends the AFA National Convention as the source to satisfy the CSTEA requirement.  The AFA convention is tailored to the professional requirements of Air Force enlisted, officers, guardsmen, and reservists.  Furthermore, it provides AFMA a unique opportunity to promote the CSTEA program in an exclusive environment.  The effectiveness, spirit, and moral boost achieved by AFMA?s CSTEA Program will deteriorate considerably if AFMA is unable to secure exhibition booths and space as required by the CSTEA program.  Market research identified no other vendors providing compatible services within the Marriott/Omni vicinity during the CSTEA scheduled time frame.  For these reasons it is determined that no source other than the AFA can meet this requirement.

<DESC>Amendment #1:  The purpose of amendment #1 is to address specific questions/ concerns posed by prospective offeror(s). Regarding specification 1: Is the sample to be counted for 3000 seconds and the 6 uR/hr from a nuclide which interferes with the analyte?  Should we presume the objective is to obtain the MDA in the shortest possible count time using the 3" minimum equivalent lead shield specified later? RESPONSE:  The 6uR/hour is the environmental background gamma exposure rate from all sources in the NAREL counting room, and is primarily from primordial nuclides in building materials and underlying soil.  The length of time that NAREL counts gamma backgrounds, 3000 minutes, was provided to permit estimation of the counting time required to achieve the specified MDA's.  The presumption is partially correct, that the objective is to achieve the specified MDA's in the shortest possible counting time using the specified shield thickness, but only to the extent that the sample changer can accommodate the associated number of samples in 16 hours of unattended operation.  The overall objective is to meet the specified MDAs, and to count as many samples as possible in 16 hours (the two back shifts, when no operators are present to load/unload samples.) Original Synopsis/Solicitation is below: THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.
