<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Advanced Resource Management (Mr. Richard Smith) for consulting services. Mr. Smith was awarded a previous contract for the initial research and interpretive writing for exhibit elements at the Hoover Dam Visitor Center.  This purchase order will be a continuation to complete the research and writing for the 14 interpretive signs for the Hoover Dam Visitor Center.  In 2002, an Interpretive Master Plan for Hoover Dam Visitor Center and Grounds was developed.  Mr. Smith was part of the planning team that created the Master Plan.  He completed the research and writing for the first 12 signs to be placed on the observation deck and interior rotunda of the Hoover Dam Visitor Center.  His intimate and superior knowledge of this project make him particularly well suited for this project since he has already completed initial research and writing about the topics to be included in the remainder of the interpretive media for this site.  It is considered to be in the best interest of the Government to make this award to Mr. Smith's company, ARM,  to complete this project.

<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service is soliciting Qualification Statements from construction firms desiring to be placed on a list of prequalified general contractors for construction of new or expanded postal facilities and repair and alteration projects in Nevada Sierra District.  This area consists of the State of Nevada and that portion of northern California including all or part of the counties of Modoc, Lassen, Plumas, Sierra, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, and Alpine.  The buildings are expected to range in size less than 8,000 square feet, with a construction cost of $100,000 to $1.0 million, and are categorized as carrier annexes, postal retail facilities, delivery distribution centers, main post offices, stations or branches.  No fixed mechanization is included in these projects.  Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of experience and have completed a minimum of two comparable projects over the past five years.  Comparable projects for the purpose of this solicitation are defined as new construction, expansion, and repair and alteration projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities with a minimum of 4,000 square feet in size and a construction cost of at least $500,000.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  Experience and references (60%); organization (25%); safety (15%).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  backlog, financial capability, bonding, banking, responsibility and affirmation.  The Postal Service will issue individual project solicitations to prequalified firms only.  Each solicitation will request a fixed price proposal.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Prequalified firms are not obligated to submit proposals in response to a Postal Service solicitation.  Awards of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations. The Postal Service retains the right to:  (1) Delete from the prequalified list any firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award pursuant to the Postal Service Purchasing Manual. (2) Prequalify additional firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be constructed and/or expanded.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition. (3) Issue open-market solicitations for specific design/build projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  This list of prequalified firms will have periodic maintenance for adding/deleting firms as required with a minimum review annually.  Qualification Statement packages may be obtained by sending an email request to skip.lee@usps.gov or nancy.young@usps.gov or grace.b.zipagan@usps.gov.

This acquisition is for proposed upgrades to an existing image analyzer with Olympus lens and Prior table. These upgrades will add additional capabilities to the image analyzer and will increase performance by decreasing sample scan time while increasing scan area and accuracy. According to market research conducted by NASA/MSFC, only Hi-Tech Metrology Product’s upgrade components are compatible with and can interface with the existing hardware and controllers. Machining and fabrication to retrofit other manufacturers' components would be too costly and time consuming.  Market research also revealed that Hi-Tech Metrology Product’s experience with image analysis, proprietary software programming and hardware interfacing makes them uniquely qualified to perform this upgrade. In addition, Hi-Tech Metrology Products is considered to be the only source capable of upgrading the image analyzer to satisfy the Government’s performance requirements within the required upgrade schedule of sixty (60) days. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 17, 2003. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3. The contract will be Firm Fixed Price.

(2) The offeror may demonstrate its experience as a General Construction (GC) Contractor responsible for the construction of five (5) additional projects within the past ten (10) years, which are comparable in nature, type, and complexity to the project in this solicitation. (3) The offeror shall submit Data and/or Information for each Project (three minimum to seven maximum) presented, in accordance with the RFP. (4.) Experience of Sub Contractors must be submitted in the format (a-u) of Item 3 under this factor. All offerors can identify up to two (2) subcontractors for each of the following trades: Controls, Drywall/Acoustical, Mechanical and Electrical. There will be no substitutions of subcontractors after the selection is made, unless otherwise approved by the CO. The subcontractors must demonstrate their experience by listing three (3) projects, within the past ten (10) years, which are comparable in nature, type, and complexity to the project in this solicitation as defined above.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541820   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA) Indoor Environments Division (IED) intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to First Moments, Inc. under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain support from First Moments, Inc. to deliver messages and materials on secondhand smoke risks to low-income clients of the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program in support of IED's goal  to reduce the exposure of children age six and younger to secondhand smoke. An ongoing partner of the WIC Program, First Moments focuses exclusively on distributing information and publications to WIC clinics and currently has multiple programs delivering informational materials to the WIC  community.  First Moments is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement due to the fact that it is the only known organization that specializes in information publication and dissemination within the highly decentralized WIC system. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541820. It has been  determined that because of the ability of First Moments to reach the large number of WIC service delivery sites, it is the only vendor uniquely qualified to meet this requirement. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of  meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this  notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via e-mail at rodgers.jami@epa.gov. Response Time: 12:00 PM EDT, November 17, 2003.

<SUBJECT>L--Technical Support - Fluid Modeling Facility's Meterological Wind Tunnel
<SOLNBR>RFQ-RT-04-00046
<RESPDATE>112003
<ARCHDATE>12202003
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Anna Mustard, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-4556
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   Experiments of flow and dispersion are currently being conducted within EPA's meteorological wind tunnel and convection laboratory.  Future wind tunnel experiments are being designed.  Each facility is a complex system of computer-controlled instrumentation that is designed and delicately balanced to satisfy the requirements of laboratory fluid modeling studies of atmospheric phenomena.  The wind-tunnel experiments involve a study of flow and dispersion in highly complex and urbanized areas  A thorough understanding of the capabilities and limitations of  scale modeling of urban areas as well as the specific similarity criteria that must be satisfied for such an undertaking is clearly required for success.  The Fluid Modeling Facility (FMF) convection lab is a one-of- a-kind facility that was designed, developed, and constructed in house by FMF  personnel.  Its mechanical, electrical, and optical systems demand highly knowledgeable and uniquely skilled scientists and technical support personnel in order to properly configure and mantain the facility for atmospheric boundary layer studies.  Both of these major ongoing projects at the Fluid  Modeling Facility require the support of a contractor with a thorough understanding of laboratory fluid modeling principles and extensive experience in designing experimental programs and performing laboratory measurements (including the design and implementation of the instrumentation to support  those measurements) and analyzing and publishing results.   Additionally the contractor would need specific abilities to identify and correct malfunctions in laboratory instrumentation,  and to diagnose and solve a myriad of problems that arise in the operation of the wind tunnel and convection  tank systems.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a fixed-price purchase order for technical support at the EPA's Fluid Modeling Facility.  The contractor would need to have the following skills:  (1) a general knowledge and understanding of fluid dynamics, with a thorough  knowledge of computer hardware and software and a wide range of mechanical, electrical, and electronic systems as related to laboratory instrumentation; (2) a thorough understanding of the fundamental principals of fluid modeling as specifically related to the theory and operation of  meterorological wind tunnels and convection water tanks; (3) demonstrated experience in designing and conducting laboratory modeling studies; (4) demonstrated knowledge of the operation and limitations of the Laser Doppler Velocimeter, Pulsed-wire anemometer, hot-wire anemometer, pitot-tube (with  MKS-brand baratron), Hydrocarbon (flame ionization detection) analyzer with custom automated range switching system, laser-induced florescence, video data imaging and acquisition systems, and wind tunnel instrument carriage controls; (5) demonstrated knowledge and understanding of atmospheric  boundary layer flows and the limitations imposed by similarity scaling in laboratory studies as well as a demonstrated understanding of the Guidelines for Fluid Modeling of Atmospheric Diffusion and the practical limitations of scale modeling of atmospheric flows; (6) demonstrated experience with  engineering designs and construction of supporting hardware and laboratory components used in wind tunnel experimentation, and; (7) demonstrated experience with major metal and wood working machinery (e.g. metal/wood lathes, milling machines, saws, grinders, welders, and a variety of hand and  portable tools). The proposed procurement is 100% set aside for small business.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990, with a small business size standard of $6 million in average annual receipts over the preceding three fiscal years.  Requests for  copies of the Request for Quotation should be mailed to Anna L. Mustard, Contract Specialist, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, or they may be faxed to (919) 541-4273.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Following is the revis ed selection criteria.  4.  REVISED SELECTION CRITERIA:  The candidate A-E firms shall be ranked in accordance with the selection criteria.  The following selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance.  Criteria (A)-(E) are primary select ion criterion:  (A) Minimum requirements for professional qualifications:  (1) An example of the key management and technical personnel are:  Two (2) senior level staff each with a minimum of 10 years experience of which 5 years are specifically related to  environmental and HTRW activities; One (1) senior chemist with a minimum of 5 years experience with CERCLA and RCRA test methods; One (1) biologist experienced with the National Environmental Policy Act and the ecological assessment of hazardous waste sit es under CERCLA; Three (3) professionally registered engineers (at least one (1) Civil Engineer) with a demonstrated background in environmental engineering, site investigations and remediation.  One (1) American Board of Industrial Hygiene certified indus trial hygienist; One (1) registered geologist/groundwater hydrologist; One (1) geo-technical engineer; One (1) toxicologist; One (1) environmental consultant skilled in public involvement and community relations, with emphasis on rural Alaska communities; and One (1) field chemist (The field chemist must have a minimum of 3 years chemical and environmental sampling experience, with preference given to arctic and sub-arctic sampling experience).  (2) AE Firm(s) should be multi-disciplined in the environmenta l field but may subcontract work.  Examples of subcontracted work include: underground storage tank assessment work; preparation of risk assessment and treatability studies; and chemical data validation to comply with USEPA Level IV.  Responding firms MUST  address each discipline, clearly indicate which shall be subcontracted, and provide a separate SF254 and SF255 for each sub-contractor.  (B) Specialized experience and technical competence in Corps HTRW-type of work.  (C) Capacity to maintain schedules an d accomplish required work in the required time.  (D) Past performance on DOD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with schedules.  (E) Knowledge of the Locality (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)).

The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration.  (G) Geographic Proximity (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)).  Proximity is simply the physical location of a firm in relation to the location of a project , and has very little to do with the technical ability of a firm to perform the project.  Hence, proximity should normally only be used as a selection criterion  for small or routine projects or ID contracts in support of a specific installation(s).  (H) Volume of DoD Contract Awards (DFARS 236.602-1(a)(6)(A)).  The response date for this synopsis is hereby extended from Nov 21, 2003 to Dec 5, 2003.

<DESC>This is modification 1 to the combined synopsis/solicitation entitled "Lithium Ion Cell Testing for Space Shuttle Orbiter Advanced Hydraulic Power System," Solicitation Number: NNJ-BH2-H26-04-001Q, which was posted on November 3, 2003.  You are notified that the following changes are made: Answers to questions posed by interested parties are posted below.  A revised Statement of Work is included with this modification. 1.Q.	 Paragraph 04. Evaluation, item 2, indicates that “Technical Information” shall not exceed 5 pages.  Does this page limitation include the past performance information (Item 1), the description of our test methods & battery sizing analysis method (Item 3), the description of our facilities, resources and equipment (Item 4), and the qualifications & experience of our personnel (Item 5)? In short, is 5 pages the total page allocation?  A. The allocation has been increased from 5 to 20 pages. The RFQ is modified accordingly. 2.Q.  The RFQ instructions indicate that the offeror selected for award will be required to submit a completed copy of the provisions at 52.213 and 52.212-3.  We assume that this means we only submit the required information if we are awarded the contract and that we do not need to submit this information with the proposal.  Is that correct?   A.  That is correct, you do not have to submit this information unless you are awarded this contract. 3.Q.  Unable to find a data sheet for the e-Moli ICR-18650I cell. Can this information be provided to us?  A.  No, it is not available yet from Moli.	Please check the Moli website for availability of this information.  The website is as follows:  www.molienergy.com 4.Q.  For all tests specified to be conducted at a given temperature, how is this temperature to be measured?  Is the probe to be in the controlled environment (suspended in the air near the cell) and assumed to be that of the cell after a given soak time, or is the temperature to be monitored on the cell body?	A.  Temperature is to be monitored at the cell skin. The SOW has been modified accordingly. 5.Q.  Test 1 (and others) - Voltage and Current are to be recorded, but to what accuracy and at what sample rate?  A.  Voltage accuracy to ± 2 mV, Current accuracy to ± 2 mA, recording frequency 1/30 Hz.  The SOW is modified accordingly. (to clarify the intent of the charging profile, it is assumed that the intent is to charge the cell at C/5 until the cell reaches 4.2V, continue charging at 4.2V until current reduces to 50ma, then terminate -- true?  A.  Yes.  6.Q.  Test 1d - How much time (days) is permissible between the conclusion of the stabilization cycling of Test 1d and the use of the cell in further test steps?	A.  No more than 6 months. The SOW is modified accordingly. 7.Q.  Test 2 (and others) - Voltage and Current and Temperature are to be measured, but it is not clear at what points during the testing profile (and again to what accuracy).  A.  Voltage accuracy to ± 2 mV, Current accuracy to ± 2 mA, Temperature accuracy to ± 2 °C, recording frequency 1/30 Hz, for during the pulse, where frequency for voltage and current shall increase to 10 Hz minimum.  The SOW is modified accordingly. 8.Q.  Test 2a - It is assumed that the intended charge rate (when not specified as in this test step) is to be C/5?  A.  That is correct. The SOW is modified accordingly. 9.Q.  Test 2b & 2c - (for this and other test steps) are these tests to be performed while the cells are held at temperature, or are the cells to be removed from the controlled temperature environment and tested at ambient within a short time period?  A.  The cells are to be charged in a chamber controlled to 25 ± 2 °C and with cells soaked for 3 hours after cell skin temperature is within 25 ± 2 °C prior to starting the charge. The cells are to be discharged in a chamber controlled to the specified temperature and with cells soaked for 3 hours after cell skin temperature is within specified temperature prior to starting the discharge.  The SOW is modified accordingly. 10.Q.	Test 3 (and others) - There is a reference to the "PTC"; I require a specification for the nominal characteristics of the specific device used.  A.  The PTC is the polymer switch inside the cell that provide reversible overcurrent protection. The purpose of the tests are to determine the electrical and thermal characteristics of the PTC. We do not have a specification for its nominal characteristics. 11.Q.	Test 3 - There is reference to loading the cell with a resistance as specified "TBD"; when will this be resolved and are there any good guesses as to likely values at this point?  A.  Likely values are between 50 mohms and 500 mohm. 12.Q.  Test 4b - cells 21, 23, and 24 are specified to be used for the test.  Is this really supposed to be 22, 23, and 24?  A.	That is Correct.  The SOW is modified accordingly.  13.    Test 5,6,8 - there is reference to a "62P equivalent" in the "Description" column; what is this? (same question for references to a "66P profile",  70P profile" and "54P profile" in test 8) xxP refers to an AHPS battery with xx parallel strings of cells. To get the appropriate power level for the cell test you must divide the battery power level in table A by xx. 14.Q.  Test 5,6 - Are these tests to be performed using the pressure profiles as described in Figures 16a and 16b of the "End Item Specification, Revision F", or are these to be done at ambient pressure?  What data is to be collected from these tests? A.  No requirement for other than ambient pressure is imposed.  Voltage accuracy to ± 2 mV, Current accuracy to ± 2 mA, Temperature accuracy to ± 2 °C, recording frequency 10Hz during discharge and 1/30Hz during charge. The SOW is modified accordingly. 15.Q.  Tests 5 thru 7c - from the wording in the "Description" column for these tests, it would seem that the original intent was to use the same three cells for all test sections.  Is this true?  A.	This is not correct. Virgin PTC switches behave differently than once-tripped PTC switches.  16.Q.  Test 7c,d,e - are all 9 cells (43 thru 51) to be treated as one group (subjected to the same tests, or are they to be separated into three groups of three as implied by the test step numbering?  If to be treated as separate groups, what is the intended difference in how these groups are to be tested?  (similar questions for 8d,e,f and 9d,e) A.  No difference is implied. 17.Q.  Test 8 - from the wording in the "Description" column for these tests, it would seem that the original intent was to use the same three cells from step 8a for all test sections (8a thru 8f).  Is this true?  A.  No. Virgin PTC switches behave differently than once-tripped PTC switches. 18.Q.  Test 10  a.	How is electrolyte leakage to be characterized by mass loss?  A.  This is for you to propose. b.	If so, should leaked electrolyte be cleaned from the body of the cell before weighing?   A.  Yes.  c.  Is there a desired physical orientation for the cells during the 91 day storage period?  A.  No. 19.Q.  Test 10a  a. Is the temperature described in the "thermal profile" the air temperature, the temperature of the cell body, or internal (if internal, how is this measured)?	A.  It is air temperature.  b.	Are thermal ramp rates controlled, and if so, what are the rates?  A.  No. Get the cell skin temperature at the required set point as fast as you can and then start the soak time. 20.Q.  Test 10b - restrictions or recommendations for fixturing of the cells during vibration testing?	A.This is for you to propose. 21.Q. Test 10c - Define "SOC" and "OCV" (verify that these are "State Of Charge" and "Open Cell Voltage").  A.  SOC is State-of-Charge. OCV is Open Circuit Voltage. 22.Q.	Test 10f - Test Name and Description are inconsistent with one another. Is this test to be performed with a storage temperature of 0C or 70C?  A.  This should state 0°C in the description column. The SOW is accordingly. 23.Q.  Test 10g - what discharge rate should be used when none is specified? What is meant by "1d" for a charge/discharge cycle?  A.  This is in error. Use the same rates as in Test 2a. The SOW is modified accordingly. 24.Q.  Test 11 - reference to "Discharge any good cells to calculate the capacity retained"; at what rate? (0.2C?)  A.  Use the same rate as in Test 1d. The SOW is modified  accordingly. 25.Q.  Test 13 - "deformation" of the cell body to what extent?	A.  You must deform the cell until its voltage drops to zero, but without penetrating (or breaching the can walls).  You can experiment with cells from other completed tests. The SOW is modified accordingly. 26.Q.	Test 14a  a.  Definition of "CID"  A.  CID is current interrupt device and exist inside the cells for overcharge protection  b.  To what extent is a "complete analysis of composition" to be performed?  A.  We want list of constituents present in quantities &gt; 1% of total sample. The SOW is modified accordingly. 27.Q.  Test 14b - is there a standard methodology for executing this test?  (We can devise one, but is there and industry standard?)  A.  No. This is for you to propose. 28.Q. Options 1 thru 3 - are all 200 cells for each Option to be conditioned per Test 1? A.  Yes. The due date for responses is not extended.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  Previous modifications are incorporated into this republishing, as well as a change in the technical POC, the deletion of the requirement to send a cover page to the Small Business office, and deletion of the Ombudsman program.  No other changes have been made.  Mark Novac, Laboratory Program Manager, 315-330-2631, (Mark.Novak@rl.af.mil) and Renee Arcuri, Contracting Officer, 315-330-4777; (Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil). The AFRL Sensors Directorate at the Rome Research Site, as DARPA/SPO's technical and program execution agent, is soliciting white papers for innovative knowledge-aided sensor signal processing approaches to improve the performance of current and future Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. This is a four-year open-ended Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) to solicit research and development white papers for the DARPA/AFRL Knowledge-Aided Sensor Signal Processing and Expert Reasoning (KASSPER) program. When operating in complex clutter environments potentially encountered in modern military applications, current Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor performance may fall significantly short of expectations based on typical benign test environments. These operational environs typically contain one of more of the following effects: (1) Complex heterogeneous clutter; (2) Dense target backgrounds (military and/or civilian); (3) Urban and littoral clutter plus other large clutter discretes; (4) Nonstationary clutter loci arising from bistatic, multistatic and other advanced applications and concepts. Current and planned ISR architectures characterize interference from the same data used to detect targets. While sufficient in benign environments and less-stressing applications, this circa 1950's signal processing framework is inadequate when confronted with complex surface target engagement applications. The instability of the statistical signal processing methodology increases with higher adaptive sensor-dimensionality and needs to be avoided to maintain the United States' combat advantage in surface target engagement. Over the past 20+ years, the US has gathered a large quantity of information on the physical and electrical characteristics of the operational environment but was not able to adequately apply this information in the radar front-end signal processing to address the complex clutter problem. Recent breakthroughs in high performance embedded computing (HPEC) and real-time database technologies are now enabling the KASSPER concept - radically altering the fundamental 'front-end' signal processing architectures through intelligent, real-time integration of environmental knowledge (DTED/DFAD, SAR Imagery, and other onboard/offboard sources), high performance embedded computing (HPEC), electromagnetic codes, and real-time database query and retrieval technologies. DARPA/SPO and AFRL/SNRT are soliciting white papers for radically altering the fundamental signal processing architectures of the ISR radar discipline. White papers should present revolutionary concepts for improved sensor signal processing performance in complex interference environments through the exploitation of environmental knowledge sources within the high-speed front-end processing environment. Specific areas of interest include: (1) knowledge-aided adaptive signal processing techniques for interference mitigation and constant false alarm (CFAR) detection processing. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (1.1) knowledge-aided intelligent 'training' methods for optimum space-time weight vectors; and (1.2) knowledge-aided pre-whitening of the space-time multichannel received signals to reduce the number of adaptive degrees-of-freedom required; and (2) real-time KASSPER processing architectures. Hence, compatibility of the adaptive filtering process (STAP) with the (CFAR) detection process and the utilized knowledge sources is essential in this effort. Demonstrations utilizing the AFRL Surveillance Facility at the Rome Research Site, Rome, NY are permitted and encouraged under this PRDA. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to four (4) page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned small, or HUBZone small business, or a Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). All white papers submitted in responses to this PRDA must be addressed to ATTN: Mark Novak, Reference PRDA-01-07-IFKPA, AFRL/SNRT, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514. Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology. White papers will be accepted until June 30, 2004. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent award. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual white paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other white papers submitted under the announcement. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY02 - 30Jun01; FY03 - 30Jun02; FY04 - 30Jun03; FY05 - 30 Jun04. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each Fiscal Year after the dates cited. Evaluation of white papers will be performed using the following criteria: a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, b) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and /or techniques, c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, and d) consideration of other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort. The criteria used to evaluate white papers will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government. Only (a), (b), and (c) above will apply to proposals. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Principal funding of this PRDA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY02. Individual awards will normally range from 6 months to 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 per year. Total funding for this PRDA is approximately $12.0M. Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submissions. Responders are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.

<DESC>The Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Ship Systems Engineering Station (NSWCCD-SSES), is in the process of standardizing general cleaning materials used aboard U.S. Navy ships. Presently, ships carry a large variety of routine maintenance and shipboard sanitation.  These products can vary in both cleaning efficiency and the degree of safety and health precautions necessary for their use. The overall goal of this initiative is to improve the safety and health aspects (i.e., reduce personal protective equipment requirements (PPE)), and environmental friendliness of the cleaning products that the Navy uses afloat without compromising the mission.  A secondary goal is to reduce the proliferation of numerous authorized cleaning agents listed on the Ship’s Hazardous Materials List (SHML).  NSWCCD-SSES has recently issued an approved shipboard cleaning products cat alog that includes general shipboard cleaning applications.  For future catalog updates, NSWCCD-SSES has developed additional Technical Purchase Descriptions (TPDs) for deodorizers, oven cleaners, dishwashing detergents, silverware pre-soak, dishwasher descaling compounds, dishwashing rinse additives, metal polishes, etc.  These TPDs describing the requirements for the listed cleaning applications are available at http://www.dt.navy.mil/acquisition/ under Announcements and then Sources Sought.     NSWCCD–SSES is soliciting participation from private industry to submit product data and documentation on the attached TPDs for the above-mentioned applications for a 3 month period ending 30 January 2004.  Based on these responses, TPDs will review the submitted information for potential catalog inclusion.  All interested vendors may forward comments and product information for c leaning agents that qualify to the performance requirements of the TPDs to Ms. Christine Socha (215) 897-7499 or Ms. Brooke Cipriano (215)897-7278, fax (215) 897-1664.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking sources capable of providing an Enterprise Portfolio Management solution for the Agency’s Information Technology (IT) Portfolio.  SSA is interested in applying a consistent analytical framework, to include processes, methodologies, and automated tools for formulating and continuously evaluating the condition of the Agency’s IT portfolio.  All solution components must be scalable to accommodate the scope and volume of Agency IT investments, and must be valid, accessible, and consistent when applied to project management as well as portfolio management. A historical view of the Agency’s IT portfolio, allowing trend analysis for cost, performance, schedule and risk over time, will be a key element of value added for SSA.  The proposed solution must address the full spectrum of OMB IT Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process and reporting requirements (such as: OMB-Exhibit-300, OMB-Exhibit-53).

Employee will be entitled to two R&R travels per calendar year. In addition, employees at Post receive 25% Danger Pay and 25% Post Differential pay.

C. Position Title of Direct Supervisor.

The supervisor will be responsible for reviewing and approving the Program Manager’s work plans and performance measures and completing a performance evaluation. 
D. Context: 
 The Program Manager will be expected to work independently, take initiative, and provide input and direction on all aspects of USAID’s Governance activities in Pakistan.  To meet these objectives, the Program Manager will work closely with representatives from local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), bilateral and multi-lateral donors, the Government of Pakistan (GOP), and U.S. Government (USG) officials at the US Embassy/Islamabad and USAID/Washington. 
E. Work Description. 
1. Introduction: 
Since independence, Pakistan has shifted among various forms of parliamentary, military, and presidential governments in pursuit of political stability.   As a result, the country has experienced considerable difficulty developing stable, cohesive political and civil society organizations. The current government of President Perez Musharraf came to power in October 1999 and returned to civilian rule following national and provincial parliamentary elections in October 2002. 
2.  USAID Governance Program: 
USAID has developed a plan for an initial $38 million, three-year governance program.  This program will support three important institutional drivers needed to achieve the Government of Pakistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy:  local governance; civil society, the media, and political parties; and national and provincial legislatures.  These institutions can play a strong and positive role in governance and in achieving the Government’s far-reaching economic and social objectives. 
 Strategic Objective:  More Participatory, Representative and Accountable 
 Governance 
Intermediate Results: 
1.   Improved Representation and Responsiveness of National and 
Provincial Legislatures
2. Greater Civil Society, Media and Political Party Engagement in Policy Dialogue
3.  Support Devolution through more Accountable and Responsive Local Governance 
 
Intermediate Result 1 -- Improved Representation and Responsiveness of National and Provincial Legislatures.  The United States welcomed the return of the national and provincial legislatures to Pakistan in late 2002.  Support for these critical branches of government will be the largest part of our democracy and governance portfolio.  USAID has already supported the newly elected legislatures by sponsoring orientation sessions for the National Assembly, Senate, and four provincial assemblies.  Through a new initiative, USAID will take a strategic approach to strengthening the institutional capacity of these legislative bodies as well as think tanks and academia that can make positive contributions.  This initiative will target newly elected representatives, especially the unprecedented numbers of women serving for the first time, for training in essential legislative processes such as budgeting, functioning of committees, and rules of parliamentary process.  The new program will also include exchanges with legislators in the region and the U.S.
Intermediate Result 2 -- Greater Civil Society, Media and Political Party Engagement in Policy Dialogue.  Civil Society and political parties have failed to effectively bridge the gap between what citizens demand and government’s desire and ability to deliver.  The media has not facilitated public debate, consensus-building and accountability which would have helped bridge this gap.  To help make governance more participatory and representative, USAID’s program will strengthen civil society actors to draw citizens into public debate of important issues, help democratize political parties, and help the media inform public debate and hold public officials accountable. 
Strengthening Civil Society Organizations.  To meet the Government’s governance objectives, Pakistanis should become more involved in policy discussions and decision-making at the national, provincial and local government levels.  Civil society organizations will not survive if they are not well run and able to attract financial assistance.  Thus, this initiative will have two goals.  The first goal is to strengthen up-and-coming NGOs’ financial management capabilities and systems to help them compete for USAID and other donor awards and become certified as tax exempt organizations by the Government of Pakistan.  The second and related goal is to create a more broad-based civil society coalition that is able to participate in economic and social policy dialogue and articulate, advocate and monitor issues at all three governance levels. 
Supporting Newly Independent Media.  The Government has taken an important step towards a more independent media when it created the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Agency (PEMRA) in 2002 and began licensing private radio and television stations for the first time.  This is an extraordinary development and warrants donor support.  USAID will help improve station management with a focus on media law and the regulatory environment.  USAID will also train radio journalists and station managers to raise standards of professionalism and improve content quality.  PEMRA will also receive technical assistance.  Women will be targeted to increase their participation and visibility in radio broadcasting.  Support will be provided to journalism schools to improve the quality of audio production.  USAID will also seek opportunities to increase the portrayal of women in the media. 
Reforming Political Parties.  Political parties in Pakistan suffer from low support from their own members and the general public.  It is one of the reasons frequently cited for low voter turnout.  There are several reasons:  corruption, dominance of personalities, lack of democratic structures and processes in party management, and poor responsiveness to constituents.  USAID may explore opportunities to work with political parties to strengthen party processes and structures, adopt constituency-based governance approaches, and focus on issues as the basis for party reform. 
Intermediate Result 3 -- Support Devolution through more Accountable and Responsive Local Governance.   USAID supports the Government’s plans to devolve decision-making and resource management to the local level in all four provinces.  To support the Government’s devolution program, USAID will establish a fund to finance innovative community development proposals presented by District governments with private sector partners.  This program will be pilot-tested in a few Districts and work through the newly established financial mechanism at the District level.  The fund should encourage communities to engage local government, help local governments learn how to manage resources, and demonstrate the merits of empowering local governance to those critical of this new approach.  Pending the results of this two-year pilot activity, conclusions and recommendations from a World Bank/ADB/DFID study on the progress of devolution to date, and consultations with the Government, USAID may develop other local governance initiatives. 
USAID will also establish a small Self-Help Fund to reward community innovation and mobilization. 

2. Duties and Responsibilities of the Position 
The Program Manager will join USAID/Pakistan’s Governance team, comprised of an FSN Governance Specialist, FSN Program Specialist, Contracts Officer and FSN Financial Analyst.  S/he will have specific program management responsibilities within the portfolio, in designing and managing USAID/Pakistan’s governance programs.  S/he will also help USAID and the U.S. Embassy achieve its democracy and governance objectives by providing strategic advice and analyses based upon recent trends and the country’s political, institutional, and socio-economic conditions.
