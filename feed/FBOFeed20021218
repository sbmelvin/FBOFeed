<ARCHDATE>12182003
<CONTACT>Susan Benik Contract Specialist 7037871350     Susan.Benik@mms.gov;
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) solicits comments on a proposal to develop health content about the Healthy People 2010 Leading Health Indicators (LHIs) for audiences identified through research and evaluation conducted under contract. Healthy People is a collaborative effort managed by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The 10 LHIs are physical activity, overweight and obesity, tobacco use, substance abuse, responsible sexual behavior, mental health, injury and violence, environmental quality, immunization and access to health care. The content would cover the 10 LHIs as separate topics and as interconnected issues that affect multiple aspects of personal and community health. LHI content would be disseminated to intended audiences through a publicly available Web site and print publications. It would be a research and evaluation contract that seeks to answer the following questions about audiences and health content for the LHIs. o	Which audiences express the most need for and interest in LHI content? o	What are audiences' expectations for the presentation of LHI content? o	How can LHI content be best presented to meet audiences' needs, interests and expectations? o	What is a "general public" audience for LHI content?  o	If a "general public" audience exists, which presentation of LHI content is appropriate to meet audience members' needs and expectations? To motivate them to take actions to improve their health? o	How does the systematic, consistent structuring of LHI content contribute to audiences' understanding and use of LHI content?   Description of Work The proposal calls for the application of theory and research to create, evaluate and prepare for dissemination a package of health content based on the 10 Healthy People 2010 Leading Health Indicators. The content would cover the 10 LHIs as separate topics and as interconnected issues that affect multiple aspects of personal and community health. Content includes health information; recommendations to intended audiences about actions they can take to improve their health; and interactive tools for intended audiences to assess and manage their health. Audiences are assumed to be composed of high-school age and older individuals. The content must be based on the best science available, include specific recommendations that intended audiences can take to improve their health, and be evaluated with intended audiences. Content development would require multiple steps outlined in specific tasks. As part of content development, evaluations of the effectiveness of the content to communicate with intended audiences would be conducted. Specifically, assessment of the value of systematically structured content on audiences' understanding and use of content is requested. The contract would include the design and creation of a publicly available Web site, a print program planners' guide, print consumer handbook, and print fact sheets to present the content, and the preparation of all materials for the OMB clearance process.  1. Is the project as described feasible? 2. What modifications should be made to the scope, tasks or deliverables? 3. Would a collaboration between a commercial entity and academic researchers be the best arrangement to accomplish the tasks as described?  Please forward comments on the above description to Susan Benik at susan.benik@mms.gov by January 17, 2003.

<DESC>The construction of the roof over the SSE (with a design life of up to 75 years) will occur during the final stages of the project to construct the SSE.  Most radiological contamination will have been fixed or removed in underlying areas where the roof is to be constructed.  A new roof will be designed and constructed over the SSE that will conceptually consist of structual steel columns, beams, girts and purlins with pre-formed standing seam steel roofing.  Open areas between the roof and the top of the reactor shield wall (gable ends and eaves) will be closed with similar sheet steel roofing material.  The roof structure will be anchored to the top of the reactor shield walls.  All remaining SSE penetrations will be sealed.  The final SSE roof structure design and calculations will be part of the subcontract for engineering, design, and construction of the SSE.  This subcontract will be set-aside for award to small business firms only.  The estimated subcontract value is between $1.8 and $2.5 million.  The subcontract performance period (award through design and completion of SSE roof construction) will be approximately 18 months.  For more information, please contact Earle Marvin, Senior Subcontracts Administrator,

Rock Areas 2 and 3 shall be completed by July 1, 2003, to allow repair work to begin on the top of the dam by another contract.  The work includes scaling the rock face of the left abutment area for Upper Stillwater Dam.  The vertical limits of the rock face areas range from 170 to 320-feet above the top of the dam and adjacent access road.  Work includes removing unstable, large blocks of rock; furnishing and installing a combination of wire mesh and cable netting to the rock face of the left abutment of Upper Stillwater Dam; stabilizing larger blocks of rocks that are being undercut by weaker rock seams.  Work includes installing rock bolts, constructing formwork, and placing concrete.  Work includes removing existing and scaling-operation-generated rock debris to designated waste areas; furnishing and installing gabion basket barrier walls and 6-foot high double-twisted wire fence; moving and reinstalling K-wall concrete barriers; furnishing and installing new K-wall concrete barriers; furnishing and installing 7-foot chain link fence; and repairing any damage to asphalt roadway surface from construction activities upon completion of the left abutment work.  Surveys will be provided by the Government.  The work will be performed under NAICS Code 237990.  Due to extreme winter conditions, a presolicitation site visit was announced on EC on October 16, 2002 and was held November 12, 2002.  Potential bidders may visit the site on their own; however, access to the site may be difficult due to snow levels.  Visits to the site must be cleared one week in advance by the Central Utah Water Conservancy District (CUWCD) and will be escorted to the site (Section 00300 - Site Visit in the specifications).  Please contact Tom Bruton or Kevin Workman of CUWCD at (801) 738-2241.  This solicitation is set aside for HUBZone competition only.  Firms that are not HUBZone certified or eligible for HUBZone joint venture will not be considered for award.  The contract will be firm-fixed price and falls within the price range of $500,000 to $1,000,000.  Prospective vendors must be registered in CCR prior to the award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.

<DESC>NA This is a small business set-aside firm-fixed price service requirement.  A copy of the Request For Quote is available as a pdf document at the following website:  http://www.poh.usace.army.mil/pohct/contracting.asp.  Fax your quote by the closing quote an d time to (808)438-8588.   The purpose of this project is to videotape an unlined storm sewer in Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii using remote video camera taping technology.  The tunnel is approximately 624 meters (2051 feet) long with 6 manholes at various intervals along the rout e.  The location of the tunnel and manholes are shown in Figures 1 thru 4.  The manhole numbers and distances along the tunnel are as follows:  (MANHOLE NO., Distance (meters)) DJ-5A, Start; D-1-17, 105.90; D-1-18, 116.75; D-1-19, 211.20; D-1-21, 333.30; D -1-22, 448.30; D-1-23, 547.80; and Outlet, 624.00.  This storm sewer is a 4 foot X 4 foot hand-dug unlined tunnel in clayey silt volcanic soil. The average depth to the crown of the tunnel from the ground surface is about 5 meters (15 feet). Unless the out side weather is rainy, the tunnel is ephemeral, flowing only during heavy rains.  Although the tunnel invert is relatively level (with gradual sloping gradient), obstructions (debris, boulders, low areas with mud/water and roots and possibly minor cave-ins , etc.) may preclude passage of the remote operated vehicle (ROV) tractor.  If such case is encountered, videotaping the tunnel will be resumed from the opposite end until the obstruction is reached or another obstruction prevents passage of the ROV tracto r.  The videotape recording shall be in color and of sufficient resolution to identify objects such as rock boulders, cave-ins, erosion features, debris, roots and unidentified blockages.  Two (2) VHS format videocassette recordings are required to be deli vered to the technical point of contact.  The videotape recording shall also have a distance measuring system such that locations of objects in the tunnel may be located on the ground surface with an accuracy of 30.48 centimeters (1 foot).  The contractor must submit a Site Safety and Health Plan (SSHP) in accordance with all provisions of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual, EM 385-1-1.  As part of the SSHP and in case tunnel entry is required, a confined space entry proc edure shall be included.  No work will begin until the SSHP has been reviewed and accepted by the Government Representative.  The contractor shall provide for all safety procedures and materials for performing the work.  All work must be completed within 3 0 days of award of this purchase order but no later than 31 January 2003.  The technical point of contact for this project is Eric D. Bjorken and may be telephoned at (808) 438-5450.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the information FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) as request for Quotation No. (RFQ) FHQ03Q00022, WINDOW FILM, to be used in the production of Government check envelopes.  The window film shall be used as covering on the window patch to the envelope.  The type of film to be use will be of Polystyrene or Glassine material, that when scratched turns white.  When applied to cover the window opening, curling of the envelope shall not occur.  All address and barcode information shall be read through the window and must satisfy the following minimum reflectance and contrast guidelines.  A print reflectance difference (PRD) equal to or more than 30 percent in the red and the green portions of the optical spectrum is required between the background material of the mail piece and the barcode, when measured with a US Postal Service, (USPS) licensed envelope reflectance meter.  All material will undergo US Postal approval.  SPECIFICATIONS OF WINDOW FILM; Polystyrene film, Procite - gloss and haze balanced window film. MATERIAL FILM THICKNESS; .00115 and 4-5/8" wide, standard diameter 18" OD with 3" cores.  Calculated window cut off length: 2 up to 2.5.  WORKMANSHIP; Window film shall be uniform and clean and shall be free from metal particles, cuts and folds or wrinkles.  The window film must be stretched tight and be free of streaks, fogging, colors and with no more than two splices per roll.

All splices will be clearly flagged with red or green or other highly visible splicing material and other conditions that can obscure the address or barcode during processing.  The window film should satisfy (USPS) minimum reflectance and contrast guidelines.  Film should adhere to web using HB Fuller poly adhesive Product #WB-3324001.  This is an adhesive that is made for application of Polystyrene material.

Inability of film to transfer from vacuum rolls to web during machine jogging and running is not acceptable.    Inability of film to adhere to web, which results in stray adhesive on transport rollers resulting in unscheduled down time for clean up, should be kept to a minimum.  TESTING; Offerors shall furnish 20 18" rolls with 3 cores.  These samples will be used for testing and cannot be returned to Offerors.  Testing will occur in two phases.

Phase II, Check Wrapping System (CWS) testing will occur at the Kansas City Financial Center.  During evaluation period in KC, the need for full technical support from prospective suppliers will need to be available via telephone or site visit.  Upon successful evaluation of testing, finished envelopes will be delivered to the USPS in Kansas City, Missouri for testing on their Optical Character Reading and Bar-coding Equipment.  Only after the USPS ensures readability and any machining issues are identified and resolved will the Treasury award said contract.  PACKAGING: Preservation, packaging and packing for shipment on mailing of all work/items deliverable hereunder shall be in accordance with best domestic commercial practice and adequate to assure undamaged delivery to the destination points.

Date for receipt of proposals:  Monday, March 17, 2003

The National Transit Institute (NTI) is seeking proposals to develop and deliver a training course entitled ?Financial Planning in Transportation.? It is a training program for about twenty-four (24) hours of instruction over a three- (3) day period.  

The financial analysis that is typically used to support the transportation plans and programs is not very detailed and generally does not use the best practice forecasting techniques.  In addition, little financial analysis is found in the plans and programs of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) suggesting that fiscal constraint is often difficult to determine and that planners fail to understand their own funding sources. Moreover, funding shortfalls may not be identified as early as possible and alternative financing strategies are rarely evaluated.  This training program will instruct practitioners on how to do financial planning in support of the development of transportation plans and programs as well as educate them in the process and the types of analyses associated with developing forecasts over the planning horizons 

The training program will also help to develop national consistency in technical and procedural approach, as well as assist transit operators, MPOs, State DOTs, FTA and FHWA field staff in understanding what are acceptable planning assumptions on the revenue side of fiscal constraint and also to coordinate their efforts with each other.

This training program is intended for the planning staffs and financial analysts of transit operators, MPO?s, and other governmental agencies (state DOT?s, cities and counties) who assist in the preparation of long-range transportation plans and transportation improvement programs, are involved with direct funding of transportation, or provide financial assistance to transit operators. It is also intended for consultants and all those involved in the development and/or review of fiscal constraint documentation.

To obtain a copy of the complete RFP, send a written request on organization letterhead to the University Procurement and Contracting address above.  Fax or e-mail requests will be accepted. Telephone requests are unacceptable.  RFPs will not be faxed.  Requests will be honored if received by Monday February 3, 2003.  RFPs will be mailed out shortly thereafter. Rutgers University is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to provide opportunities to small businesses, minority-owned businesses and/or female-owned business.  These businesses are encouraged to submit proposals.

It is estimated that any other contractor would require at least one year to acquire the level of knowledge and experience that Jacob Sverdrup has and that thi s would result in a corresponding delay in delivery of the required products by not less than one year.  The increase in cost for another contractor to perform the work is estimated at being not less than 25 percent.  Delivery will be to the Coastal Systems Station, 6703 W. Highway 98, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.

<DESC>Katmai National Park (KATM) and Aniakchak National Monument  (ANIA) have approximately 800 and 149 km of coastal shoreline respectively.    The purpose of this contract is to conduct a biophysical inventory and  produce ShoreZone Maps of the 949 km of the coastal intertidal and  backshore in these park units.   This effort will complement ShoreZone  mapping completed for Lake Clark and Kenai Fjords National Parks during  2001-2002, and result in a compatible network-wide shoreline  classification and dataset. The base data used for habitat mapping in ShoreZone is low-tide, aerial  video imagery. The shoreline will be flown using a helicopter during  the lowest tide windows of the year (mid May, June or July in 2003).  Approximately 300 km of shoreline are typically imaged in one day and  appropriate low-tide windows are 5-6 days in duration. In addition to aerial mapping, ground verification sampling is  conducted to expose mappers to the biota and beach features.    This  ground-truthing supports interpretation of the aerial imagery.  Shore stations  are inventoried during the same low-tide window using a survey vessel as  a base, and skiffs to position survey crews at pre-selected shore  stations. Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council (EVOS) has funded the  development of an Alaskan shoreline Mapping Protocol for FY2003 and this Protocol  is currently under development.  A key element in this protocol  development is devising a strategy for treating wide-intertidal areas.  The  linear model, that used in the Washington Protocol for KEFJ, is not  appropriate for much of KATM where a polygon model is needed.  Low-tide,  georeferenced air photos exist for both KATM and ANIA (NPS) and will be  used as a basemap for intertidal polygonal base map of wide-intertidal  areas. These existing 1:63,360 electronic shoreline maps will be  segmented according to the Protocol and data records on the biophysical  features within each segment linked to the maps. Deliverables- 1.	Aerial Survey-Video Imagery 	An aerial Video Imaging manual showing flight line tracts and tape  locations 	A set of either SVHS or miniDV master copies and 1 VHS copy 	Web posting of 1-sec video image captures 	Electronic files with GPS trackline data 2.	Field Verification 	A verification report with databases of all field data including: 	Photography 	A summary of recommended Bio-bands for use with the aerial  interpretation 3.	ShoreZone Maps 	A segmented ArcInfo compatible shoreline with polygon, point, and  linear coverage's 	An Acess97 database and data dictionary 	Full FGDC content standards metadata files for all electronic data  products 	A summary report on key resource distributions 	A user manual that provides a simplified description of data and its  uses 	A training module All reports, supporting documents and data should be provided in hard  copy as well as electronic form.  All written documents should be in  Microsoft Word 97.

<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to procure KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT ASYNCHRONOUS COLLABORATION LiveLink software from Open Text, Inc. of Bannockburn, Ill., on a sole source basis, pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1. The software provides combined document and data sharing, knowledge management, collaboration tools, a 'view' feature which can automatically convert files posted in the collaborative space to "html". This feature supports approximately 200 file format types needed to convert a considerable amount of scientific notation.  LiveLink also offers a module which facilitates automatic creation of web pages based on user-defined templates.	Both of these features are especially important to support voluminous amounts of information shared via the web.  NASA's requirements for such a suite of asynchronous collaborative tools includes the following: 1. Cross-platform capability: the system must be able to run on	    Macintosh and PC computers concurrently. It also must be    compatible with client systems:  Unix/Linux, and other	 (Solaris, etc). Any package that offers weak (Java) or no	Macintosh support, or works only on the most recent Macintosh    operating system, is not an option.   2.  Server license availability. 3.  A core system which includes existing optional modules, not	 requiring extensive customization.  4. Accessible for upload and download using email rather than	 an outside source, notification of changes to the database via	subscription, strong full-text searching capabilities,		  scheduled agents, automated launch 5.  Ability to concurrently support up to 1,000 community members	in up to 150 collaborating institutions nationwide. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The base period will be for seven months, followed by two twelve-month options. Base period includes contractor provided software application, hosting facility, training, and maintenance support. Option I will include purchase of a software perpetual license, and 12 months of support. Option II will provide an additional twelve months of software support. The Government does intend to acquire a commercial item, using FAR Part 12.   Interested organizations may submit, in writing, their capabilities and qualifications to the point of contact, identified below, not later than 4:30p.m. local time, December 30, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort using full and open competition, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program, intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with the National Academy of Public Administrators (NAPA).  The objectives of this study are:  market failure analysis and comparison of alternative organizational models.  This study shall re-examine MEP's core premise-that there are structural and informational barriers that prevent small firms from obtaining the technical and business advice that they need to improve their productivity, and that for-profit consulting firms cannot and do not serve this market.  The objective of this analysis is not to validate MEP's existing partnership model, but to thoroughly understand the advantages and disadvantages of that model relative to viable alternatives.  The study objectives frame the major elements of the study approach and anticipated deliverables.  The approach overall should incorporate extensive input from MEP's key stakeholders, including State and local co-investors (many of whom will be meeting in MEP's Fall roundtables); members of Congress; Department of Commerce officials; the NIST Director; OMB officials; and Modernization Forum members.

For all phases of the project, an MEP staff person will be assigned as liaison to gather relevant background material, coordinate and set up identified visits and interviews, and support other informational and logistical needs identified.  Phases within the Statement of Work include:  Phase I, Study Design, includes identifying the study team; gathering data and information required to fully understand MEP's programmatic goals, organizational structure, major business practices, stakeholder community, and study objectives; and developing a final study plan that specifies the research agenda, methods, outputs, timeframe, and cost of each phase of the proposed study.  Phase II, Market Failure Analysis, identify the study team; gather data and information required to fully understand MEP's programmatic goals, organizational structure, major business practices, stakeholder community, and study objectives; and develop a final study plan that specifies the research agenda, methods, outputs, timeframe, and cost of each phase of the proposed study.  Phase III, Alternative Business Models, given the program's statutory purpose and the best available evidence about the size and scope of the market failure it addresses, identify and evaluate alternative business models for providing the needed advisory services to small manufacturers; the alternative business models should be assessed in terms of investment levels and sources, required operational conditions, potential level and scope of impact (e.g., programmatic outcomes), overall effectiveness, and any other key variables identified by the study committee.  Phase IV, Stakeholder Review, conduct broad stakeholder review of the results of Phases II and III, either through a series of focus groups, workshops, or any other effective approach.  

The Government anticipates the award of a commercial Firm Fixed Price (no fee) purchase order on or about January 6, 2003.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b).  The requirement will be for a period of one (1) year with no option years.  FAR Part 13.5 "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items" will apply to this requirement.   Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the Government will consider all capability statements received by January 2, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.

<DESC>NASA has received several industry responses to its notification on October 25, 2002 regarding the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems consolidation stating that NASA intends full and open competition; therefore, we would like to solicit additional ideas.  The contemplated EVA consolidation would combine work from four current contracts; the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) EVA contract (NAS 9-97150), the Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) portion of the NBL/Spacecraft Vehicle Mockup Facility contract, the Space Flight Operations Contract - Flight Crew Equipment (SFOC-FCE) (NAS 9-20000), and the Science Engineering Analysis and Test contract (SEAT) (NAS 9-19100).	For many years, we have awarded hardware and sustaining efforts associated with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) related EMU activity non-competitively to Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International.	Qualification of a proven second source for OEM related activities would be extensive.	NASA does not desire to direct a subcontract.  Given this situation, please provide your options for contract strategy.   Please provide your response to Jessica Niebuhr by January 15, 2003.  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for future postings.

<DESC>The Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Pacific intends to procure a computerized system for the production of specifications for shipyard work on Coast Guard Cutters and Boats.   The system shall provide the following functionality: 

1)	Removes from the engineer developing the specification the clerical/word processing tasks of writing specification items and compiling specification packages. 
2)	Creates a history of previous specifications developed by the Specifications Branch. 
3)	Enables the effective integration of past specifications into documents that are currently under de-velopment. 

The offeror shall provide a Commercial Item that will enable the user to create specification items of free-form text, graphic elements (.jpg, and .gif as a bare minimum, with greater flexibility highly desired), and formatted field data (e. g., applicable cutter class, cutter name, Ship Work Breakdown Structure (SWBS) classification, keywords, and specification item titles); search and find existing specification items via the formatted data fields; update, reuse, and modify the text, graphics, and data associated with specification items; aggregate specification documents into composite documents, with front matter such as a cover page, table of contents, general require-ments, and consolidated lists of references, and Government Furnished Materials; easily find and re-use common specification documents; search by cutter class, cutter name, specification title and SWBS; and re-designate specification items initially prepared for one-time use as recurring speci-fications. An example of a current specification for shipyard work can be viewed at http://www1.eps.gov/EPSData/DOT/Synopses/499/DTCG85-03-R-625005/AttachmentJ1--SpecificationforGALVESTONISLANDDD.doc

Proposed solutions shall operate with commodity PC-compatibles (Pentium IV or better) in a Win-dows NT network, running MicroSoft Office 2000 Professional.

The contract will include options for software support for four one-year periods.

The product must be compliant with the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C 794d).

3.3 The following past performance definitions will be used during the evaluation:

3.3.1 Current and Recent.  Relevant on-going contracts and contracts completed within five (5) years from the issue date of this solicitation are recommended.  Current performance will have a greater impact on the performance confidence assessment than less recent performance.

3.5 In conducting the performance confidence assessment, the Government reserves the right to use both data provided by the offeror and data obtained from other sources.


4.0 FACTOR 2: PRICE

4.1 To be acceptable, an offeror's price must be fair, reasonable and affordable.
 
4.2 The Government will use the price analysis techniques specified in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2) and evaluate offerors prices in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(1) and AFFARS 5315.305(a)(1).

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), operated by the University of California for the Department of Energy (DOE), is preparing a solicitation to provide design-build services for a light laboratory-office building and general support structure(s). 
The Chemistry & Metallurgy Research Building at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is 50 years old and is scheduled to be inoperative as a nuclear facility in 2010. A replacement facility is proposed to be constructed at Technical Area-55 (TA-55).  The replacement facility is envisioned to consist of a Light Laboratory/Office Building (LLOB), a Security Category I building, a Security Category II building, and support structures to house utilities. A Personnel Intrusion Detection Alarm System (PIDAS) will separate the Security Category I & II buildings from the LLOB and the utility building(s) in the overall project. 
This project is for facilities outside the PIDAS and is identified as the Chemistry & Metallurgy Research Building Replacement Project (CMRR) Light Laboratory/Office Building (LLOB) and the utility structure(s) to support all of CMRR. The project is referred to as LLOB. The LLOB will provide laboratory and office space for approximately 500 personnel. Approximately seventy thousand (70,000) net square feet of office space and twenty thousand (20,000) net square feet of laboratory space will be required in a single building. There are security height restrictions on structures in the vicinity of a PIDAS. Building horizontal dimensions are also restricted. The support structure(s) will house hot water heating, sanitary sewer, and chilled water for the entire CMRR project, not just LLOB. The LLOB main building will include a multi-purpose entrance atrium, separate office areas for un-cleared and "Q"/"L" cleared personnel, chemical laboratories, a food service area, a loading/unloading dock, and areas for expansion of office space. Approximately one-third of the office space will be for un-cleared personnel and two- thirds for "Q"/"L" cleared personnel. Provision for expansion in the support structure(s) is required.
The award of this contract is contingent upon the receipt of funding from the Department of Energy.  Capital funding for this project is expected to become available by September 30, 2003. The University intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract to the successful design-build firm that best meets the Laboratory's goals and objectives contingent upon availability and approval of these funds.
The project will be designed and constructed under a Design-Build contract with an estimated cost of approximately $45M.  Design is scheduled to start November 2003 and be completed by December 2004.  Construction will be completed in December 2005. Department of Energy "Q" or "L" security clearance is not required for work on this project. A LANL-issued badge or authorized escort is required for all personnel on site. The Laboratory's Associate Directorate for Operations will oversee the design and construction of the LL/OB.

Solicitation

If you are interested in participating in this solicitation submit your company name, contact, and phone number by January 24, 2003.  Do not transmit information at this time for the RFQ or RFP.   It will be requested at a later date which will be announced on our Business Web Site: http://bus.lanl.gov/bus5/default.htm approximately January 27, 2003.  We also plan on holding a bidder conference approximately February 3, 2003 to go over this solicitation in more detail.

Selection of the successful offeror for award will be based on a best-value source selection process using a two-phased approach: Phase 1, the Request for Qualifications (RFQ); and Phase 2, the Request for Proposal (RFP).
	
Phase 1, Request for Qualifications. 
To be qualified, each offeror must demonstrate: 
 ?   Prior Experience on similar design-build projects, identifying owner,    point of contact, telephone number. 
? Proposed project team organization
?    Resumes of Key Personnel with applicable experience, availability,    and commitment to this project.
?   Quality compliance capability to 10 CFR 830.120
?   A notable safety record compared to National Safety Council statistics
?   Evidence of financial stability, including Dunn & Bradstreet rating
?   Corporate, Key Personnel and Subcontractor Teaming Experience
? Capability to perform construction utilizing local labor and materials
 
Qualifications Statements will be due approximately February 19, 2003.  


Phase 2, Request for Proposals

This will be a best value competition for the design and construction.  The RFP is scheduled to be issued approximately April 7, 2003 to about 3 short listed finalists from the RFQ process. Firms receiving the RFP will receive performance specifications upon which to base a Conceptual Design. Firms will have over two months to prepare design sketches, outline facility functions/adjacencies, and to demonstrate hardware and software capabilities.  Each firm will provide a three-hour oral presentation to the SEC followed by a one-hour Q & A period.  The SEC will evaluate presentations in July 2003.  Negotiation of "best and final' offer will take place in September 2003.  Contract award is scheduled for October 2003 with Notice to Proceed for design in November 2003 and construction in January 2004.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS DESCRIPTION:  Air Force Space Command at Schriever AFB, CO seeks potential sources capable of performing the following non-personal services.  Services to be provided for the Global Positioning System (GPS) Support Center, hereafter referred to as the GSC.  The GSC is the single point of contact within DoD for all military and civil GPS issues.  The GPS Support Center?s primary mission is to provide tactical support to warfighters in the exploitation and assessment of GPS effectiveness in mission planning, monitor system level performance to ensure compliance with military and civil directives, maintain the DoD GPS problem report database, facilitate resolution of GPS service disruptions, and facilitate resolution of user reported problems.  The GSC supports the warfighter in all aspects of mission planning, mission execution, exercises and tests.  The GSC currently produces thousands of products in support of warfighting operations, to include regional/area position error and Precision Dilution of Position predictions, post mission assessments, constellation performance monitoring, and GPS anomaly/outage reports.  These products are used by theater weapons employment planners to build GPS-guided munitions sorties.  The GSC not only serves the needs of the warfighter, but also provides support to several civil agencies, including the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the United States Coast Guard Navigation Center.  The GSC currently reports to 14th AF and resides within the 2nd Space Operations Squadron of the 50th Space Wing located at Schriever AFB, CO.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT OF WORK	

The Global Positioning System satellite constellation plays a key role in the areas of force enhancement and force application across a broad spectrum of Department of Defense (DoD) missions by providing precise navigation, positioning, and timing.  In addition to the large-scale integration of GPS functionality into DoD's warfighting concepts, systems, doctrine, and operations, millions of civilians and foreign governments utilize the system on a continuous basis. 

The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to identify potential sources to operate and sustain the DoD GPS Support Center.  The GSC will provide monitoring of the performance of the GPS constellation and its constituent subsystems. The GSC will respond to DoD, USCG Navigation Center (NAVCEN), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) NOCC problem reports and requests for information, and coordinate the collection, analysis, and distribution of information related to all GPS related anomalies.

Potential sources shall be capable of providing the critical information regarding system and vehicle level performance that is required for effective management and military exploitation of this national asset, providing an official reporting structure for the gathering, analysis, and reporting of information regarding system level performance and user reported anomalies. 

TASKS/TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

<SUBJECT>A--ON-BOARD INERT GAS GENERATION (OBIGGS)/ON-BOARD OXYGEN GENERATION (OBOGS) TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to publicize Phase II of this planned acquisition, related to aviation safety, specifically as it relates to inerting gases from an on-board system and compartment fire suppression.  The first phase of this procurement, the Initial Design and Feasibility Study, is nearing completion. The time is approaching for exercise of Option Phase II for the fabrication and delivery of hardware that will ultimately be tested by the Government.  This goal of this procurement was to develop systems/sub-systems that would provide on-board inert gas generation (OBIGGS) for both fuel tank inerting and cargo compartment fire suppression; and to provide on-board oxygen generation (OBOGS) in an emergency for passengers and crew in a commercial jet aircraft in the event of the loss of cabin pressure. The system(s) will be sized for the needs of the Boeing 737-700 aircraft. One of the objectives of the initial phase of this procurement was to demonstrate the technical feasibility for providing the nitrogen and oxygen gases in the rates and purity necessary to meet the requirements specified herein. (Note: the target aircraft platform was changed from the 757-200 of Phase I to a 737-700 since the FAA has acquired a 737-200 and offered it for NASA testing.) The Government does not intend to issue a new solicitation for Phase II. As defined in the NASA FAR Supplement 1817.7301-5, this acquisition is a progressive acquisition; hence, all pertinent Phase II information (Statements of Work, Proposal Instructions and Evaluation Criteria) have been described in the original RFO.  Basic Technical Requirements/Considerations for Approaches to the Program Phase II 1.    Fill the 737-700 center wing tank (CWT) of 4,400 US gallons with inert gas from an on-board system, such that the O2 concentration in the ullage shall not exceed 11.5% prior to departure from gate. For back-to-back flights assume a 40-minute turn-around time. The requirements for inerting for the first flight of the day or for an aircraft just out of scheduled maintenance are not part of this technology demonstration. Alternate inert gases will also be considered as candidates 2.    For cargo compartment fire suppression, provide sufficient inert gas to prevent a smoldering fire from flaring up again in the rear cargo compartment of	660 ft3, assuming the fire was initially suppressed with some other knockdown technique and assume a leakage rate of approximately 11 ft3/min. An OBIGGS system must be able to reduce the ambient oxygen concentration from 21% to 12 % in 25 minutes at 8,000 foot altitude pressure, and maintain this concentration for 120 minutes. 3.	     Provide 2.6 standard liters per minute of breathing oxygen for 150 people during 12-minute emergency descent to 10,000 ft after depressurization at 35,000 ft. The oxygen flow rate shall be no less than 0.5 kg/min during the initial five (5) minutes, and its purity shall be at least 93%. After that, the oxygen flow shall be no less than 0.18 kg/min at 30%. 4.   The available electrical power and compressed-air resources are listed in table 1. Other Considerations 1.   The FAA 737-200 will be the intended ground-based test bed for the prototype system. If the aircraft is not available, a ground-based simulated test facility will be used. The volumes and functions will be functionally the same as that on the 737-700.  2. The system will be a self-contained and pallet mounted. Note that the smaller and lighter the system the better. Reduction of power and bleed air resources is greatly desired. 3.      Instrumentation requirements and interfaces will be defined at the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) following the design award, at a later date.  4.	   This combination system is required to perform only one of these three functions at any given time. 5.  A partial system bid will be considered at correspondingly reduced cost. However, preference will be given for system that can perform all three tasks. The expectation is that only the Phase I Contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase II, Hardware Development. Nonetheless, proposals from all responsible sources received by the specified due date will be considered. In order to contend for a Phase II award, such prospective Offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to the current Phase I contractors. Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable, with no further consideration for Contract award.

<SUBJECT>99--NOTICE TO JOHNSON SPACE CENTER VENDORS
<DESC>Dear NASA Vendor: This message is to inform you of the currently scheduled timeline for Johnson Space Centers (JSCs) conversion to the Integrated Financial Management Programs (IFMP) Core Financial module, and to invite you to a discussion of how these activities may impact you.  As you may know, NASA is implementing IFMP, an agency-wide initiative to modernize its financial and administrative systems and processes.  JSC is going live with the Core Financial module, the backbone of IFMP, in February 2003.	This module, powered by SAP software, provides timely, consistent and reliable information for accounting and budgeting decisions, and facilitates improved information exchange with NASAs Centers and vendors -- laying the foundation for NASAs e-commerce and e-government initiatives. Please be aware that as we implement IFMP cutover activities, the JSC Financial Management and Procurement offices will be working hard to ensure continuity of service; however, payment processing may be interrupted during our cutover window.	While we are leveraging lessons learned from NASA Centers that have already implemented IFMP, we know that they did experience problems with the timely processing of payments.  We ask that you be patient as we transition to the new system.  Listed below are the most current JSC-specific conversion activity dates communicated by the IFM project management: 	 Tuesday, January 14 (Noon):  Deadline for submission of vendor invoices to the JSC Financial Services Branch to be processed in legacy system before legacy system shutdown.   Wednesday, January 15, 2003:  Deadline for vendor invoices to be processed in legacy system before legacy system shutdown.     Saturday, January 18, 2003: Legacy system shutdown.  Begin legacy data conversion procedures.  Monday, February 24, 2003: Target Core Financial Go Live: Target date to begin processing new transactions in the Core Financial environment.	Also, target date to begin processing transactions accumulated during legacy system downtime.   No sooner than March 7, 2003:  Vendors can expect first invoice payments processed from within the new system at JSC. To facilitate communications, the following meeting is scheduled to discuss IFMP rollout activities in more detail.   I invite you to attend, in person or by teleconference.  Tuesday, January 7 12:00 p.m.  1:00 p.m. JSC Building 2 Teague Auditorium Dial-in: 1-888-592-9603 Password:  Go Live Leader: Dorothy E. Swanson As we near the final cutoff of our legacy system, we will continue to update dates and activities.  Prior to the meeting, if you have a question or concern, please contact Wayne C. Buckley at 281-483-5568 or Rod Etchberger at 281-483-3115 for procurement questions or the JSC Financial Services Branch Chief, June Boeckel, at 281-483-7877. The success of Core Financial and IFMP is critical to the future mission success of JSC and NASA.  While there will be challenges, I look forward to achieving the vision of IFMP with all of you.

<SUBJECT>75 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company?s overall financial status.  

Large Format Inkjet paper (7530-00-NIB-0670 - Bright White Bond, 24 pounds, 36 inches x 300 feet).  

In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm?s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 

To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 

When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 

For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Solid State Video Recorders
<DESC>Solid State Video Recorder Request For Information


The Air Armament Center and Air Force Flight Test Center plan to replace tape-based flight test video recorders in test and test support aircraft at Eglin AFB and Edwards AFB.  These recorders will replace production and flight test tape recorders currently used to record multifunction display, CVTS camera, and HUD/Raster video sources. The Investment Programs Office of the 46th Test Wing is seeking information on the availability of technology to develop, perform qualification testing, and implement the requirements of a Solid State Video Recorder (SSVR).  This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to solicit information pertaining to two specific areas, recorder form fit replacement of existing TEAC V83 triple deck 8mm recorders, and data encapsulation in accordance with IRIG-106 Chapter 10.

<DESC>DARPA Mission,
The DARPA mission is to develop imaginative, innovative and often high-risk research ideas offering a significant technological impact that will go well beyond the normal evolutionary developmental approaches; and, to pursue these ideas from the demonstration of technical feasibility through the development of prototype systems.


FutureMAP Program Objectives,

Strategic decisions depend upon the accurate assessment of the likelihood of future events.  This analysis often requires independent contributions by experts in a wide variety of fields, with the resulting difficulty of combining the various opinions into one assessment.  The FutureMAP program at DARPA is investigating the use of markets and market-like mechanisms in aggregating information from diverse multiple sources.  Specifically this will involve (a) defining and running demonstration markets for proof-of-concept, (b) conducting analytical studies to develop new market structures and features of interest to the DoD, (c) designing and running a laboratory testbed to evaluate and validate market structures, and (d) conducting red team exercises to ensure robustness.  Additionally, FutureMAP will investigate ancillary topics such as incentives for participation, the use of information markets in conjunction with natural markets, and regulatory and logistical issues.

We have two efforts ongoing, and would like to complement these with a few small studies.  These small studies might cover topics that are currently not being investigated by the DARPA projects, or they might provide additional oversight and analysis of challenges faced by the two ongoing efforts. We would welcome proposals for small projects, not to exceed $100,000 in cost, that might complement these two ongoing lines of work.

One of the ongoing efforts, at Neoteric Technologies (http://www.neotek-al.com/) is defining and managing markets to answer specific questions of interest to the DoD.  Typically these markets will have a small number of invited participants who will bring their information together through the market mechanism.  We envision markets of 15 to 20 participants addressing questions about the probabilities of specific kinds of failure within our national infrastructure.  The results from these markets would be used as input to further analytical steps, perhaps within the context of Bayesian networks.

The other ongoing effort, at Net Exchange (http://www.nex.com) is defining and managing long-running markets based on data series that are available from independent news and intelligence sources.  The markets will allow the trading of futures on composite securities that express changes in combinations of series.  Composite securities provide a participant, who has insight into interrelations among basic securities, with a means of expressing this insight and benefiting from the expression if correct.  A simple composite is an intersection between two basic securities; e.g., the probability that a decrease in Country X GDP will coincide with an increase in Country X civil unrest.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has a requirement to integrate an Ultra-Light Aerial Diesel Engine (ULADE) in its Leaflet Delivery System (LDS), Wind Supported Air Delivery System (WSADS) variant to replace the current ROTAX 914 gasoline engine.  USSOCOM intends to test and evaluate applicable U.S. and foreign commercial off-the-shelf Aero Diesel Powered Engines in the 100 HP range for use on the WSADS, and ultimately to provide performance data and analysis for projects integration of small diesel engines on other air, ground, and watercraft platforms.  Diesel-powered engines provide a logistical advantage over other engines powered by different fuel types, while complying with DoDD 4140.25, DoD Management Policy for Energy Commodities and Related Services: an initiative to convert military equipment to common fuels on the battlefield. The LDS Program Manager intends to conduct a full and open competition for ULADE test prototypes.  A USSOCOM request for information was solicited on February 1, 2001, Submission No. 50C541 in the Commerce Business Daily, and again on March 13, 2002, Reference Number FCT-ULADE.  A Fiscal Year (FY) 03 Foreign Comparative Test FCT project has been approved to test a non-U.S. commercial off-the-shelf ULADE to meet this USSOCOM requirement, and based on that approval, is proceeding with this FCT.  This FCT is to test and evaluate applicable commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Aero-Diesel Powered Engine engines. This request for information/request for proposal (RFI/RFP) seeks foreign COTS diesel powered aero engine manufacturers. Phase I of the FCT will be a weighted technical evaluation to determine whether or not a responding manufacturer?s engine product meets the performance specifications.  The selection evaluation will also include a comprehensive review of a manufacturer?s technical capabilities, cost of the ULADE, and managerial/past-performance data.  A single manufacturer will be selected.  Phase II of the FCT will involve the procurement of two engines from the successful manufacturer which will undergo testing and evaluation against a US-made engine currently under development. The engine will be evaluated as candidate for integration into an existing powered para foil system associated with the Leaflet Delivery System (LDS) program requirement. The engine will also be assessed for possible integration into other platforms. The comparative testing will lead to a production decision to determine which engine (foreign or domestic) will be integrated into the WSADS.  A sole-source production award to the successful manufacturer is anticipated sometime in FY 05. Interested contractors may contact the POC listed below to obtain a copy of these specifications.  Responses to this RFI/RFP announcement are due on or before 30 Jan 03.  POC:  Marc Duval (813) 281-0560, ext. 304; Email: duvalm@socom.mil.  See Note 22.
