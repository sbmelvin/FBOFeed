<DESC>TITLE: FA4809-08-Q-0253, Sole Source Acquisition for a Night Goggle Virtual Terrain Board 
               

The 4th Contracting Squadron, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC intends to award a sole source purchase order to Night Readiness, LLC for a one Night Goggle Virtual Terrain Board.   Night Readiness, LLC is the manufacturer and sold distributer of this product.  Manufacturer:  Night Readiness, LLC

This purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The closing date for this synopsis is 29 September 08 at 4:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. The anticipated award date is 30 September 08.  For information regarding this purchase, please contact Judy Taylor at (919) 722-5410 or SSgt Nitra Latta at (919) 722-5408.  

APPLICABLITY OF AUTHORITY:  The required item is available only from one responsible source and is the only product compatible with F-15E training requirements. Night Readiness LLC is the manufacturer and sole distributor of this product to military installations.  The NVG will be used to train F-15E aircrew on NVG operations, tuning and visual illusions/hazards specific to different types of terrain, celestial lighting and ground cultural lighting.  Such training is required by AFI 11-2F-15E Volume 1 and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) guidance for aircrew NVG training.   Current syllabus training utilizes an antiquated static terrain board.  Replacement of this static board is required because it occupies an entire room which is needed for other training devices.  The VTB system will replace the static terrain board and offer greatly increased training capability as well as take up much less space.  The Night Readiness VTB meets and exceeds all F-15E NVG training requirements and would represent a badly needed improvement to training in a hazardous flight regime (night, low altitude training).  The VTB system was developed as a prototype from USAF and USN funded research and development to create high quality NVG classroom training.  It has been used to train USAF students for nearly two years.  Night Readiness is a primary research contractor with AFRL and is the only company with this proven NVG virtual technology.  Award to any other source would result in unnecessary delays and extra costs as there is no other system that is readily available.

Proposals for higher TRLs are desirable, but not required under this solicitation. It is the government's intent to identify and develop promising AT technologies with the potential to transition to operational use to meet identified requirements. TRLs will be the metric used to identify the maturity of AT technology programs. Each proposal should include a basic technical and cost proposal, executable in FY09-10, with their associated ROM cost. In the basic proposal, offerors are required to provide a detailed technical description of the approach they will follow in order to develop and demonstrate an AT technology to TRL 4 or beyond. Additionally offerors are required to propose an analysis of issues associated with continuing the development of their technology to operational use.</p>

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source bridge contract to SGT, Inc. pursuant to 10U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of NASA's Goddard Space FlightCenter (NASA's GSFC) Flight Projects Directorate. This procurement will provide a bridgecontract for a period of up to 6-months from October 28, 2008 through April 27, 2009 andwill have a maximum ordering value to allow sufficient time to finalize contract awardactivities associated with the PAAC III procurement.  This bridge contract will allow forperformance on task orders, for modifications to task orders, and for new work until theProgram Analysis and Control (PAAC III) follow-on contract activities are finalized. Thebridge contract and maximum ordering value are necessary in order to ensure programcontinuity and critical mission support and to avoid significant technical andprogrammatic impacts to GSFC. The Goddard Space Flight Center has the responsibility forplanning and managing spacecraft flight hardware systems, ground systems, launchvehicles, and research instrumentation payloads. This responsibility encompasses allphases of project implementation from conceptual studies through definition, design anddevelopment, fabrication, integration, launch, preparation for pre- and post-launchoperations, satellite servicing, data acquisition, processing, distribution, analysis,and archiving. To develop and manage projects (present and future) and to respond to itsassigned responsibilities, GSFC requires contractor services to include planning andscheduling, configuration management, management information systems,documentation/library, general business, and general accounting in support of theplanning, managing, and executing of flight activity in the Flight Projects Directorateand supporting directorates.  These requirements depend on the in-depth knowledge of NASAGSFCs systems, management structure, and personnel.  An interruption of those tasks,with a new contractor that is unfamiliar with NASAs GSFC environment and the specificrequirements of the PAAC contract, would greatly jeopardize the success of NASA GSFCsimplementation of critical and highly visible Agency programs.

<DESC>Introduction<br/><br/>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  <br/>

<br/>The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement for establishing large scale, coordinated Systems Biology Programs that utilize a combination of computational and experimental methodologies to conduct research Projects to analyze, identify, quantify, model and predict the overall dynamics of the network of cellular molecular components of microbial organisms and their interactions with the host cells.<br/>
Description<br/> 

<br/>Each research Project of the Systems Biology Program shall concurrently utilize multiple high-throughput ?-omics? technologies to generate a diversity of experimental data. These experimental data shall be collected and integrated to develop and/or validate computational models of the molecular interaction networks involved in the biological processes under investigation.<br/>  

<br/>The resources generated by the System Biology Program shall be made publicly available and easily accessible to the scientific community through public data, software and reagent repositories and through web portals The ultimate goal of the Systems Biology Program is to enhance knowledge of the overall complexity of the biological, biochemical and biophysical molecular processes in microbial organisms and host cells which may lead to the initiation and progression of infectious diseases. Such information should identify novel, unique, as well as common molecular signatures that may represent future targets for intervention and could aid in the identification of emerging pathogens and in the development of antimicrobial drugs, immunotherapies, vaccines and diagnostics for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, thus potentially translating basic research findings into clinical applications.<br/>

<br/>It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about September 15, 2008. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  10.45 FTEs.<br/>

<br/>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This BAA will be available electronically on/about August 15, 2007, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.<br/>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure a Multi-Function Display (MFD) System in support of PMS 500?s DDG 1000 Program.  The tasks cover design, fabrication, testing and delivery of the production representative model, as well as support for integration, installation and checkout.  Upon successful completion of developmental test, integration test and first article test the Government may exercise contract options for production and fielding of seven systems and spares.  A competitive 100% Small Business Set Aside is anticipated.
The MFD program objective is the acquisition and initial support of an integrated display that will provide three different visual cues for day and night helicopter operations on DDG 1000 class ships.  The visual cues integrated into the MFD include the flight deck status display, a horizon reference display and an Aircraft-Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) System position display.  The MFD will communicate with the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) Network through redundant Distributed Adaptation Processors (DAPs) to receive ship?s roll stabilization signals from NAVDDX and to update settings such as deck status and lighting intensity to accommodate a variety of meteorological and lighting conditions for flight operations.  The system will be controlled by command signals from a remote operator.  The operator interface will be a Common Electronic Display (CED) provided by the ship builder and located in the Helicopter Control Station (HCS).  Commands will be received by the MFD via the TSCEI and DAPs.  Emergency operation and maintenance capability will be provided via a hard-wired maintenance control panel provided as part of the system.  The MFD program will involve designing, building and testing a production representative system in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the DDG 1000 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and to demonstrate conformance to the MFD System Specification with the option to purchase production systems.  The MFD contract is a portion of the next generation suite of Visual Landing Aids which will be incorporated into the DDG 1000.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to the companies that respond to the FedBizOpps synopsis, as well as those companies on the solicitation mailing list.  Because the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the solicitation package is mailed.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a company?s CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.
Award will be based on a determination of ?Best Value?, which may require discussions with the offerors. The evaluation factors will be Technical, Experience, Past Performance, and Price.  Copies of DD Form 2345 and request for copies of the solicitation shall be forwarded to Mr. David Andreoli, 732-323-5208, david.andreoli@navy.mil, fax # 732-323-7440.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p>We at Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) imagine and envision a world in which information is virtual and on demand with global reach. Information is protected by identity based capabilities that allow users to connect, be identified, and access needed information in a trusted manner. It is a world in which United States military forces can deploy and connect no matter where they are located, pull information needed for their missions, and be given timely, accurate information on any threats they may face. It is a world with no seams between the sustaining base and the tactical edge so that operational agility is enabled. It is a world in which the United States military can freely exchange information routinely with coalition partners and others responsible for the security and defense of the United States. The technology employed is agile, adaptive, and capabilities-based. And, we imagine and envision a world in which our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are equipped with capabilities and services that are state-of-the-art.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1.  Policy.  In response to desires expressed by the user community, and in keeping with the agency's commitment to work with industry, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking information on products and capabilities to replace the Conference Control System (CCS) currently supporting the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) operations.  Information sought under this request will be used to gain an understanding of marketplace availability of products and capabilities that meet FAA operational needs.  Although the Operational Conference System (OCS) implementation plans are still evolving, it is the agency's policy to provide industry with pertinent information early on.  Implementation is expected to begin before 2011.  The OCS is expected to support the projected needs for a high capacity telecommunications conferencing system through a ten (10) year lifecycle.  The RFI responses will serve as a means of learning what the market capabilities are and to gauge industry's level of interest in working with the FAA to provide switching products meeting the Command Center's operational environment needs.  In addition to comments on the OCS technical requirements and capabilities, industry input on the FAA's planned business approach for acquiring the OCS capability is strongly encouraged.  The FAA will continue to keep industry informed through future announcements.
   2.  Objectives.  The FAA intends to work with the communications equipment manufacturing and service industries to provide a communications capability to support current and future ATCSCC operations
   3.  Operational Concept. The Operational Conference System (OCS) will be high-capacity telecommunications conferencing system.  Air traffic control specialist (ATCS) at the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) will use the OCS to coordinate with national and international and weather organizations to establish and maintain ad-hoc, meet-me, progressive, and preset telecommunications conferences.  The telecommunications conferences will be used to expedite the flow of air traffic and enhance the safety and integrity of the National Airspace System (NAS).  Air traffic control specialist (ATCS) will be able to quickly and easily initiate and manage simultaneous conferences.
     The OCS will provide a telecommunications conferencing capability for simultaneous small and large scale predefined telephone conferences and contingency conferences initiated from the ATCSCC.  The duration of a conference is normally from five (5) to 100 minutes.  The host for a conference requires the capability to identify which incoming line is active and the capability to mute or disconnect individual lines without affecting the other conference participants.  There are normally less than 100 participants in planning conferences, however the OCS must be able to accommodate up to participants.
   The OCS will provide sophisticated connection, switching, and conferencing capabilities for voice communications supporting air traffic management coordination between FAA facilities, commercial air carriers and other associated organizations.  OCS will interface with existing interphone networks, consisting largely of government-furnished point-to-point and multi-unit dedicated lines.  The OCS will support multiple signaling/supervision interface requirements and provide complete dialing functions for local, long distance and international destinations.  The OCS will be fully consistent with current operational concepts of ATCSCC communications.  The ATCSCC System will duplicate the basic functions and features of current equipment, and will add new features for operators (air traffic control specialists and supervisors, and maintenance personnel).  It will be easy to operate, thus reducing training requirements and lowering the risk of communications-related errors.
   It is expected that new FAA systems should meet the requirements for On-Site Maintenance Monitoring capability, including, but not limited to, the reporting of all fault detection to the maintenance position, to the supervisory positions, to any remote maintenance terminals, to the maintenance logging function, and to remote alarms, as required.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences
(DCCPS), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH),
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate for an
extension of contract HHSN261200544006C with Research Triangle Institute (RTI).
The title of this project is Informatics
 Support Center
for Breast and Colon Cancer Family Registries (BC-CFR&rsquo;s). This extension is
planned under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR
6.302-1. A follow on contract modification will prevent a substantial
duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered
through competition. This project is for the continued data
coordination/management and statistical/technical support experience as well as
capabilities in software development for the purposes of data management and
quality control. To perform the requirements of this contract, the Contractor
must be well versed in the Breast and Colon-Cancer Family Registries (BC-CFR),
particularly the participating sites and the local informatics units. The
Contractor must have an understanding of, and comply with National Cancer
Institute&rsquo;s Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB) specifications; provide relevant
technical training and assistance to the BC-CFR participating sites and NCI;
and provide statistical and study design support to the BC-CFR investigators,
their collaborators and NCI. RTI has already built a significant data
management and quality control infrastructure, transferred the original
Informatics Support Center (ISC) central database to this infrastructure,
performed data cleaning, develop a number of software applications requested by
NCI as well as the BC-CFR community, developed a virtual tissue repository
pilot system, received and aggregated data transmitted from the BC-CFR sites,
and provided requested data sets to investigators under contract number
HHSN261200544006C. The proposed contract extension will permit RTI to continue
(1) quality control and cleaning of core and ancillary data; (2) to maintain
data available to the scientific community through the BC-CFR collaborative
projects; (3) to provide high-quality datasets to Principal Investigators of
BC-CFR approved projects; (4) development and maintenance of the Biospecimen Tracking
System; (5) maintenance and enhancement of the Virtual Tissue Repository; (6)
to provide statistical methodology and research design support to BC-CFR
investigators and NCI, and (7) to evaluate and develop software tools as
needed. Interruption of these activities while another contractor gains the
knowledge required to provide these data coordination services to the BC-CFR
investigators and collaborators would lead to a paralysis of continuity and
enhancement of the central database, as well as the development and support of
collaborative projects. Therefore, the Government has determined that Research
Triangle Institute is the only able source to satisfy agency requirements to
avoid these unacceptable delays or a duplication of effort. Interested parties
may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement and
must respond by submitting the information on/before the closing date noted in
this announcement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response
to this announcement must demonstrate knowledge and experience of the Breast
and Colon Cancer Family Registries (BC-CFR), particularly the participating
sites and the local informatics units. Organizations that submit capability
statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to
assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for
which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under
the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for
competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days
(thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement)
after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the
Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed
contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of
the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Special Communications Requirement Division  (SCRD) on behalf of The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Program Executive Office SOF Warrior (PEO-SW), PM for Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FOSOV) located at MacDill Air Force Base, FL, is looking for information from companies with the products and capabilities to provide Commercial off the Shelf (COTS), Non-Developmental Items (NDI), or Internal Research and Development (IRAD) technologies to support a bridge system that integrates C4ISR, navigation, and platform monitoring and control functions on Mobile platforms such as HMMWV, MRAP and maritime combatant craft.  The Integrated Bridge System (IBS) must provision for integrated workstations that permit operators to access, monitor, and control radio voice and data communications; C2/SA systems and software applications such as FBCB2 and C2PC; sensor systems such as EO/IR video cameras; navigation systems such as GPS and Falconview; and monitoring of platform systems such as electrical power systems health, alternator and reserve power capacity.  The IBS must also provide radio intercoms, conferencing, bridging and voice management.  Solutions must include all processors, signal interfaces, network infrastructure, user interfaces, and software to permit complete and efficient operation and management of the platform and its electronic systems.  Equipment used in the approach must provide reliable operation in harsh environmental conditions typical of tactical vehicles and maritime applications.  The primary intent of the IBS is to combine requirements and material solutions where both were previously standalone, and ultimately reduce the total Space, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements of the C4ISR suite on mobile platforms.  The vendor must identify the form factors of their proposed solutions (size and weight of components), as well as power requirements, cooling enhancements, security features, and any built-in diagnostic capabilities.  The vendor should clearly indicate which previous standalone systems are being combined and how their system reduces the total hardware set and space claim.  In addition, the vendor should identify whether the systems are engineered by the vendor or if components are integrated.  The vendor should identify the technical readiness level of their system and clarify (support) any such statements that claim tested, approved or fielded.  The Government is seeking cost data, where available, but a response to this inquiry does not imply a contractual obligation.  The vendor should identify any relationships with Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and System Integrators (SIs).  Additionally, the vendor should identify any enhancements or capabilities that distinguishes them from other similar competition, such as: range of features, open systems approach, modularity and scalability, human factors, ease of upgrade, or other relevant distinctions.  Furthermore, the vendor must identify the following post-sale support information: detailed warranty information, training provided, level of support, service level agreement for the stated level of support, and how many cleared personnel will be available to support their solution or group.

The Government intends to host a technical demonstration day on 19 November 2008 (location to be determined) in which interested parties will be invited to demonstrate their products and discuss government requirements.  Additionally, the Government may acquire for testing purposes one or more vendor systems.  

THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), BUT RATHER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) from industry that will allow the Government to identify interested sources capable of meeting the requirements as stated in this synopsis.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above. 

Interested parties are requested to submit their comments, and can additionally provide a capabilities statement of no more than 5 pages in length that demonstrates the respondents ability to meet the requirements as specified herein.  The Government is interested in receiving vendors commercial published price lists for items they believe meet the need in this RFI, and is also interested in lead-time.  All data received in response to this RFI, marked or designated as corporate or proprietary, will be fully protected from release outside the Government.  Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future associated RFP that may be issued.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: www.fbo.gov.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.  All responses, including capability statements, shall be submitted no later than 3:30 PM EST, 30 October 2008.  All interested parties should send any comments or questions to Karin Weinert (Phone: 732-323-1177, E-mail:  karin.weinert@navy.mil) or Jillian Kohler (Phone: 732-323-4545, E-mail: jillian.kohler@navy.mil) in Microsoft Word format or Portable Document Format (PDF).   

The Government is not committed nor obligated to pay for the information provided, and no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information.

The intent is to replace the USMCs current Cold Weather Glove.  After review and evaluation of industrys submissions, the most promising candidates may be procured for FY09 Marine field testing to determine if it warrants Marine Corps adoption.<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION:  <BR>The Marine Corps seeks products that meet the requirements outlined below:<BR>"Provide cold/wet weather protection and insulation<BR>"Waterproof yet breathable with water repellant outer shell fabric<BR>"Fast drying<BR>"Removable water repellant insulated liner<BR>"Good durability<BR>"Good dexterity & grip   <BR>"Will not freeze <BR>"Clo value  minimum of 1.2<BR>"Will consider flame resistant (FR) or no melt/no drip items, but it is not required.<BR><BR>If testing supports adoption of the CW Glove, it would be issued as organizational equipment from the USMC Special Training Allowance Pool (STAP) as required for unit training and deployment.  Basis of issue (BOI) will be 1 per.  The quantity USMC would procure would be dependent on the phase in plan and available funding. STAP full stock level is 35,000 pairs.  Sustainment quantity is projected to be 10,000 pair per year.<BR><BR>GLOVE CANDIDATES:  The Government requests interested suppliers identify gloves that are within their existing product line production capabilities, or can be easily modified to meet the required salient characteristics.     <BR><BR>To respond to this RFI, interested suppliers are REQUIRED to submit the following for their submission to enable the Government to efficiently evaluate the viability and benefit of your proposed glove.

The supplier must identify the requirements it meets. If a supplier submits multiple products to fulfill a component, they must identify the advantage/disadvantage of competing products.<BR>2.Provide estimated unit cost per pair.<BR>3.Submit 5 pairs (in any color or print on hand) of various sizes including SM, MED and LRG. <BR>4.Describe other attributes that may not be apparent from material description provided and a visual inspection of gloves.<BR><BR>Initial samples submitted by interested suppliers are due 15 Nov 08 for Marine Corps review.

<DESC>A. General Information<BR><BR>Northwest Region seeks to initiate the standardization process for Crutches and Canes for its 7 Army, Navy, and Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alaska & Washington.  This will be a replacement/re-evaluation of RIA R11-03-01-001 which expired December 2006. The product line consists primarily of crutches (wood and aluminum) and canes (standard and offset) as detailed below. <BR>Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for Quotes (RFQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is 3/09.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>The Point of Contact is Patricia Cordier, phone: 253-968-0898, and e-mail patricia.cordier@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B. Products and Performance Required <BR>The Region is seeking Crutches and Canes which at a minimum include the product lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $86,786.70.  This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR><BR>CRUTCH ALUM PUSH BTN ADULT LF<BR>CRUTCH ALUM PUSH BUTTON TALL LF <BR>CRUTCH ALUM PUSH BTN YOUTH LF <BR>CRUTCH ALUM TALL 5'10 - 6'6 <BR>CANE WOODEN ONE SIZE <BR>CANE, WALNUT WOOD 1X36 6/BX <BR>CRUTCH ALUM ADULT 5'2 - 5'10 <BR>CANE STD MENS 1IN WOOD WALNUT<BR>CLOSED STYLE HANDGRIPS<BR>CANE, OFFSET ADJ. W/WRIST STRAP<BR><BR>At the request of the Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor<BR><BR>C. Instructions to Vendors <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to patricia.cordier@amedd.army.mil.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature and samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D. Evaluation Criteria <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFQ.   Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/ company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company        criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a.  Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b. The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability. This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1. Vendors must provide a complete line of crutches and canes. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  At a minimum, a complete product line includes: adjustable aluminum crutches in adult, child and youth sizes, and canes, (both wood and aluminum) with standard and/or off-set handles.  <BR><BR>NOTE:  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  <BR><BR>2. Vendors must have a DAPA, or be in the process of applying for a DAPA, for the Cruches & Canes Product Line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR><BR>3. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Regions Prime Vendor (currently, Cardinal Health is the PV for distribution in Region 11.)  Please provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR><BR>4. Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  <BR>   a. Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  <BR>   b. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous   agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.<BR>   c. Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>5. Vendors must have a local vendor representative in the Northwest Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.<BR><BR>6. Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for items in their crutches and canes product line, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  <BR>   a. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  <BR>   b. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.<BR>   c. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.  Additionally, the Government will not contact any points of contact that are provided in response to this question.<BR><BR>7. Products have safety features (example of a feature is non-skid tips) that assist in patient stability during ambulation and thus help prevent patient falls. Please describe the safety features of your products.<BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The CPT developed a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set was based on advances in technology, patient safety, and on historical usage for the product line. The CPT also determined that the clinical/performance evaluation will be performed in a non-clinical setting. <BR><BR>1. The following procedures will apply. <BR><BR>   a. The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date 30 days from date of request. <BR>   b. Each vendor will send the samples directly to the participating MTFs at the addresses listed at the end of this announcement. <BR>   c. All email communications between vendors and the region concerning sample set shipment will be digitally signed.<BR>   d. Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process.<BR>   e. Due to the potential for samples to become lost or delayed in shipping, all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date.  <BR><BR>2. The samples to be provided are as follows: <BR><BR>        Adjustable push button aluminum crutches and replacement tips and 	handgrips:  Adult, 2; Youth, 1; Child 1.<BR><BR>       	Wood Canes:   Standard Handle, 1<BR><BR>  	Aluminum Canes:  Adjustable with Standard Handle, 1<BR><BR>3. The CPT will evaluate each product against the clinical/performance criteria. All criteria will carry equal weight.  The evaluation will take place in a non-clinical setting.  <BR><BR>4. The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or no; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or yes; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations.  .<BR><BR>5. The CPT has set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative  at or near 3.1  depending on the location of any break (or gap) in vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.1, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>6. Rules of Engagement: <BR>   a. Standardization Evaluations will be conducted in areas designated by the TRBO.<BR>   b. Clinicians will use the clinical/performance evaluation process described above. Evaluations will be collected by the TRBO.<BR>   c. CPT members can have no invested personal interest in the outcome in a standardization effort. <BR>   d. CPT members will be familiar with the specific guidelines for accepting gifts and incentive type items from vendors.  Any violations of the guidelines will be reported to the appropriate officials.  <BR>   e. The TRBO will perform statistical analysis of data obtained from the evaluations.<BR>   f. Vendors will deliver products to designated location and specified time as agreed upon by the vendors and the TRBO.<BR>   g. Vendors presence will not be required during this evaluation.<BR>   h. When participating in a standardization effort, vendors must contact the TRBO prior to contacting any clinical personnel in reference to the product being considered for standardization. <BR>   i. Additional education or training on the selected products will be at the vendors expense. <BR>   j. All evaluation methods will have a start and stop date set by the CPT that will be strictly enforced.  <BR>   k. The government is not responsible for cost of sample items, shipping of these items, or any costs associated with the clinical evaluations.<BR>   l. Only products selected by the CPT will be reviewed during an evaluation.  All other products presented during the evaluation will be rejected.<BR>   m. Unless specifically requested by the TRBO, NO COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD SPEAK TO ANY HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBER OR TPRB MEMBER REGARDING PRICE OR PRICE-RELATED FACTORS.<BR><BR>Failure to comply with any of the rules of engagement described above may result in disqualification of your company from further consideration.  Please do not hesitate to contact our Nurse Analyst at 253-968-0898 for questions.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted clinical/performance criteria:      <BR><BR>Setting and number of trials:  Criteria will be evaluated in a non-patient care setting by clinicians simulating the process of ambulating with crutches.  Clinicians will evaluate each criterion at least 2 times. <BR><BR>Crutches:  <BR><BR>1. Height mechanism adjusts quickly with only simple, intuitive steps required to make adjustment.<BR>   a. Rationale:  Clinicians require this feature because patients sometimes must adjust their crutches and since patients can have limited ability to follow complicated instructions, steps must be quick and intuitive.<BR>   b. Evaluation method:  The evaluator will adjust the crutches and note whether the adjustment can be performed easily and quickly.<BR><BR>2. Underarm pads minimize underarm discomfort during crutch use.<BR>   a. Rationale:  Clinicians require this feature because crutch pads without certain ergonomic features (smooth, curved surface with non-bulky padding) increase underarm friction causing underarm irritation and soreness.  <BR>   b. Evaluation method:  Evaluator will ambulate with crutches in a non-weight bearing manner, and note any underarm discomfort related to underarm pad design.  <BR><BR>3. Hand grips minimize undue strain on the hand/wrist during crutch use.  <BR>   a. Rationale:  Clinicians require this feature because an ergonomically designed and padded hand grip supports the palmar arch and wrist without causing undue rotation of the hand.  A proper handgrip also reduces pressure on veins, arteries and nerves in the hand resulting in less muscle fatigue.  <BR>   b. Evaluation method:  Evaluator will ambulate, non-weight bearing, with crutches and note any wrist/hand discomfort related to hand grips.<BR><BR>4. Tips of crutches stay securely seated on the crutch during ambulation and promote stability during ambulation.  .<BR>   a. Rationale:  Clinicians require this feature because tips that are easily dislodged from the crutch or tend to slip during ambulation, increase the possibility of a patient falling during crutch ambulation, potentially causing patient injury.  <BR>   b. Evaluation method:  Evaluator will ambulate, in a non-weight bearing manner, with crutches and note whether the tips stay securely seated during ambulation.  <BR><BR>5. Replacement parts (tips, hand grips and underarm pads) are the same quality as those on the product sample.  <BR>   a. Rationale:  Clinicians require this feature as patients require the same quality and functionality for crutch parts regardless of whether the patient is using the original part or replacement parts. <BR>   b. Evaluation method:  Evaluator will compare the replacement part with the part that is on the crutch to determine if the quality of the part is equivalent.<BR><BR>Canes: <BR><BR>Setting and number of trials:  Criteria will be evaluated in a non-patient care setting by clinicians simulating the process of ambulating with canes.  Clinicians will evaluate each criterion at least 2 times. <BR><BR>1. Canes are lightweight.<BR>   a. Rationale:  Clinicians require this feature because patients who require assistive devices to ambulate tire easily.  A heavy cane would increase fatigue related to ambulation.<BR>   b. Evaluation method:  Evaluator will ambulate with the cane and note whether the cane feels heavy or lightweight.  <BR><BR>2. Cane handle is comfortable.  <BR>   a. Rationale:  Clinicians require this feature because a properly designed and padded hand grip supports the palmar arch and wrist without causing undue rotation of the hand during cane use minimizing muscle fatigue<BR>   b. Evaluation method:  Evaluator will ambulate with the cane in a partial weight bearing method, and note any wrist/hand discomfort related to the cane handle.<BR><BR>3. Height mechanism adjusts quickly with only simple, intuitive steps required.<BR>   a. Rationale:  Clinicians require this feature because patients often must adjust their own crutches.  Since many patients do not have healthcare knowledge, steps must be quick and intuitive.<BR>   b. Method:  The evaluator will adjust the crutches and note whether the <BR>process can be performed easily and quickly.<BR><BR>Note:  The region uses both adjustable canes and wooden canes that are not adjustable. Criterion will only apply to the adjustable canes.  <BR><BR>4. Safety features assist in patient stability during ambulation.<BR>   a.  Rationale:  Clinicians require this feature because patients who require assistive devices to ambulate are at higher risk for falls.  Any feature that minimizes the falls risk is desirable to prevent patient injury.  <BR>   b.  Method:  The evaluator will ambulate with the cane in a partial weight bearing manner and note stability of the cane when bearing weight on the device.  <BR><BR>Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the actual acceptability threshold (at or near 3.1 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total regional requirement.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements. (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines. (3) Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>

<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Broom, Lobby by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7290-00-NIB-0001 BROOM, LOBBY</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA/FAS Southwest Supply Center, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Broom, Lobby to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>UNS916/P</p>
<p>UNS 951BP</p>
<p>8558777</p>
<p>5W638</p>
<p>611038-5411-12</p>
<p>5407-12</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Wiper, Laminated to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than October 10, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0030. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>Special Notice DARPA-SN08-53:  Rapid Altitude and Hypoxia Acclimatization Proposers Day Workshop DATE: October 20, 2008, REGISTRATION DEADLINE: October 10, 2008, TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Michael Callahan, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4596, 
Meeting Registration: https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=DAR55124


Rapid Altitude and Hypoxia Acclimatization (RAHA) Proposers Day Workshop, DARPA-SN08-53.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring a proposers day workshop to promote novel collaborations and new strategies that will allow for rapid (hours to 7 days) acclimatization to high altitudes and other conditions of hypoxia, as evidenced by physiological measures of athletic performance and tolerance of low oxygen tension environments. Ultimately, the RAHA program will create a novel prophylactic measure sufficiently advanced to perform a Food & Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Phase I clinical trial and prepare for an FDA-approved Phase II clinical trial at the completion of the DARPA program.
  
The RAHA proposers day workshop will be held on the 10th floor of 3811 N. Fairfax Dr. Arlington, VA 22203 on October 20, 2008.  The goals of the session are: (a) introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the RAHA program vision and goals; and (b) explain the current need for accelerated acclimatization among soldiers deployed to mountain conflict and security operations, and (c) encourage and promote multi-disciplinary teams among potential research organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the RAHA program. 

The proposers day workshop will include overview presentations by Government personnel including clinical researchers from DARPA, military personnel from the Mountain Warfare Training Center and Fort Benning U.S. Army Rangers as well as representatives from the FDA and members of the hypoxia and altitude research community. 

Appropriate teaming will be a critical element in successfully responding to the DARPA RAHA Broad Agency Announcement BAA08-60. Teaming and information session participants are strongly encouraged to prepare a one-page description identifying their areas of capabilities including relevant publications in hypoxia, altitude, clinical trials and small molecule discovery. The descriptions will be used to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming discussions.  Your one-page description must be submitted to RAHA@darpa.mil no later than October 10, 2008 at noon ET.  

Participants are strongly encouraged to interact with complementary experts to propose orthogonal solutions to altitude and hypoxia adaptation. A teaming website has been established to facilitate interactions across many disciplines. Also, material presented at the teaming and information session and DARPAs response to clarification inquiries will also be available on the teaming website: http://teaming.sysplan.com/RAHA for those interested in DARPA-BAA08-60 but are unable to attend the session.  

There is no registration fee to attend this teaming and information session. Each participant in a performer team may bring a maximum of two members. Additional personnel may be considered on a case by case basis and requests can be made by emailing RAHA@darpa.mil. Early registration is strongly recommended as space is limited. The registration cutoff date is October 10, 2008, at noon ET, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.    

Further administrative information can be obtained by contacting Jameel Bennett (Jameel.bennett.ctr@darpa.mil). Additional technical information can be obtained from Michael Callahan (RAHA@darpa.mil).  Please refer to the RAHA Proposers Day Workshop in correspondence.  This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The solicitation document is available at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa08-60.html.

<DESC>By way of this Notice and in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District, US Army Corps of Engineers, announces its intentions to award a sole source contract to Smith Root Incorporated (SRI) of 14014 NE Salmon Creek Avenue, Vancouver, Washington, for the purpose of acquiring the technical assistance and consultant services of SRI.  Under the contract, SRI will be primarily responsible for furnishing product documentation and installing patented element (i.e., pulse generators, control and monitoring system, power and communications equipment, cables, and conduits, and an operational system) at the USACE Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Aquatic Nuisance Species Electric Dispersal Barrier IIB.  SRI is the only contractor that currently has the technical and management expertise needed to complete the mechanical and electrical systems of the Barrier.  To its credit, SRI has a broad knowledge base in Dispersal Barriers. As a sole source provider to the Chicago District-USACE, SRI designed and built Barrier IIA; the proposed Barrier IIB will have identical functions and similar design features as Barrier IIA.  The electrical components of these facilities (Barriers IIA and IIB) relate to one or more patents held by SRI, who maintains all licensing rights.  As the design of Barrier IIB is developed, it will be critical to consult with SRI to insure that features are consistent with the functioning of the patented electrical components.  The period of performance is for approximately nine 9 months.  It is anticipated that the resultant contact will be a firm-fixed price contract.  This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers, proposals, etc.  However, interested firms may send a capabilities statement NO LATER THAN the close of business on October 18, 2008.  Statements should be sent to the attention of Anita Simpkins at anita.r.simpkins@usace.army.mil; ensure that the subject line of your email includes the title/description of this announcement.  Negative responses are requested.  Award is anticipated on or about November 18, 2008. This announcement is in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The point of contact is Anita Simpkins at (312) 846-5372.

<DESC>Procurement is for a furnish-and-install package to erect a steel heavy-duty pallet rack at the Hill Air Force Maintenance Depot, USA Medical Material Agency, MCMR-MMM-DU, 6149 Wardleigh Road, Building 1160, Bay 1, Hill Air Force Base, UT  84056-5848.<BR><BR>This new procurement is a side-by-side installation with an existing pallet rack procurement from Pro Lift.  To achieve engineering continuity and for preventive maintenance purposes, the new pallet rack needs to tie in with the existing unit, with equivalent special foot plates and corresponding heavy-duty steel reinforcements that comply with zone three seismic requirements.  The new rack procurement needs to complement the existing rack by having the new steel beams structurally intersect and interchange exactly with the existing steel beams, maintaining and complementing the existing architectural configuration without compromising the pounds per square inch capability.  Pro Lift is able to provide the engineering continuity during the erection process that can not be provided by others, as well as ensure the compatibility of the new and existing rack system and guarantee that stress load requirements will not be abridged during or after erection.<BR><BR>In the absence of drawings and precise architectural specifications, the ability to compete this procurement is limited inasmuch as it is a side-by-side installation, an expansion of the current pallet rack in which the new pallets are interconnected with the existing structure, which was erected by Pro-Lift in 2005.  After fulfillment of the current procurement, it is anticipated that upcoming rack requirements will be competed, since spatial configuration requires future pallet racks be erected as stand alone units.

<DESC>TITLE: FA4809-08-Q-0253, Sole Source Acquisition for a Night Goggle Virtual Terrain Board 
               

The 4th Contracting Squadron, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC intends to award a sole source purchase order to Night Readiness, LLC for a one Night Goggle Virtual Terrain Board.   Night Readiness, LLC is the manufacturer and sold distributer of this product.  Manufacturer:  Night Readiness, LLC

This purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The closing date for this synopsis is 29 September 08 at 4:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. The anticipated award date is 30 September 08.  For information regarding this purchase, please contact Judy Taylor at (919) 722-5410 or SSgt Nitra Latta at (919) 722-5408.  

APPLICABLITY OF AUTHORITY:  The required item is available only from one responsible source and is the only product compatible with F-15E training requirements. Night Readiness LLC is the manufacturer and sole distributor of this product to military installations.  The NVG will be used to train F-15E aircrew on NVG operations, tuning and visual illusions/hazards specific to different types of terrain, celestial lighting and ground cultural lighting.  Such training is required by AFI 11-2F-15E Volume 1 and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) guidance for aircrew NVG training.   Current syllabus training utilizes an antiquated static terrain board.  Replacement of this static board is required because it occupies an entire room which is needed for other training devices.  The VTB system will replace the static terrain board and offer greatly increased training capability as well as take up much less space.  The Night Readiness VTB meets and exceeds all F-15E NVG training requirements and would represent a badly needed improvement to training in a hazardous flight regime (night, low altitude training).  The VTB system was developed as a prototype from USAF and USN funded research and development to create high quality NVG classroom training.  It has been used to train USAF students for nearly two years.  Night Readiness is a primary research contractor with AFRL and is the only company with this proven NVG virtual technology.  Award to any other source would result in unnecessary delays and extra costs as there is no other system that is readily available.

The Point of Contact for all information regarding this acquisition is Greg Sinsel, Contract Specialist, at the address and phone number listed below. No collect calls will be accepted. No telephone requests or written requests for the solicitation will be accepted. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION, Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subparts 6.302-1(a)(1) and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(a), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competition procedures is justified for this procurement action. The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2 (Content). The BOP, Office of Information Systems has a requirement for the annual maintenance renewal of 3436 software licenses for the Stedmans Plus Medical/Pharmaceutical Spell Checker, 2008 ASCII Word List, and the acquisition of an additional 200 Stedmans Plus Medical/Pharmaceutical Spell Checker, 2008 ASCII Word List for new users. The Medical Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker Software is utilized and incorporated with the BOP's existing Electronic Medical Records (EMR) System. The BOP requires the Stedman Pharmaceutical Software for use with the EMR system currently in use by the agency. The software maintenance services licenses and additional new users include: all new software releases; system update; program temporary fixes (PTFs); documentation updates; and toll-free hot-line support twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week for system software assistance. The estimated value of this acquisition is estimated at $36,085.00. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, it is determined that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). The BOP requires the renewal for software maintenance and acquisition of additional licenses for the Stedman Plus Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software for the EMR system. The software will be part of the current system. In addition, the EMR system is a rights protected system, and the EMR software vendor utilizes the Stedman software as the spell-check feature on the pharmacy module. The Stedman vendor, Wolter Kluwer Health, Inc., owns the proprietary rights for the Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software and has not authorized this product to be offered for resale by other vendors. Due to Wolter Kluwer Health, Inc.'s, owning the proprietary rights to the Stedman's Plus Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software and that the product has not been authorized for resale by other vendors, no further efforts to obtain competition were made. A review of the proposed price was completed by the Contracting Officer. Based on the submittal from the vendor and a comparison of current and historical acquisition data for similar maintenance renewals and acquisitions of software licenses, it was determined that the quote was based on established market pricing and is acceptable to the Government. The Contracting Officer has made the determination that proposed price is fair and reasonable. In accordance with FAR 10.001, Market Research was conducted by both the requiring activity and the Contracting Officer. It has been determined that to not maintain the spell-check software and maintenance service for this system would be detrimental to the BOP, as the pharmacy systems controls and directs the types and amounts of medication being dispensed to the inmates. The BOP also requires additional licenses for deployment to the BOP medical offices, and to obtain software different from the current software would be detrimental to the overall operation of the BOP EMR system. The BOP will continue to conduct market surveys and make efforts to obtain competition for future acquisitions. Contracting Officer Certification- I hereby certify that this request for Limited Source Justification is made in good faith, and that the supporting justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. //s// Donald G. Sinsel, Contract Specialist; National Acquisitions Section. Approval://s// Jan R. Johns, Chief, National Acquisitions Section.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">(2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">(4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(A)<em> The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B)<em> The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</em> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in">(ii)<em> Examples.</em></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>In accordance with DFARS clause 252-232-7003, entitled "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests," the Department of Defense (DoD) has implemented a new electronic invoicing system, known as Wide Area Work Flow - Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), which is designed to automate and expedite commercial invoices and government receiving reports by electronically processing these items. WAWF-RA will simplify your Government invoicing process, allow you to monitor you payment status online, and ensure faster payment transactions for your company. WAWF-RA is a web-based program and is available at no cost to your company. For assistance with WAWF, please call 1-866-618-5988. To register your company for WAWF, simply log into https://wawf.eb.mil. Step-by-step instructions on how to register and how to submit invoices through WAWF-RA are outlined at https://rmb.ogden.disa.mil. There is a training web site that provides hands-on training in a non-production environment at the following link https://wawftraining.eb.mil.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Be advised that all interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database in order to receive an award. If you are not registered you may request an application at (888) 227-2423 or through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.<br />You will also need to update your Centralized Contractor Registration (CCR) account with your Electronic Business Point of Contact (EBPOC). The primary responsibility of your EBPOC will be to register additional company personnel in the WAWF-RA system. General questions concerning payment should be directed to the Defense Finance Accounting Services (DFAS) Customer Service number at 1-800-756-4571.</p>
<p>NOTE: Invoices against firm fixed price contracts are to be sent directly to DFAS via WAWF, not the contracting office.

<DESC>September 26, 2008<BR><BR><BR>Directorate of Contracting<BR><BR><BR>SUBJECT:  Questions & Answers Submitted in Reference to W90FU0-8235-9001, Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) Active Radio Frequency Identification (aRFID) Tracking Systems, Fort Sill, OK<BR><BR>The following Questions and Answers were received in response to subject RFQ. <BR><BR>QUESTION:  What is the square footage for each of the five locations where the aRFIDs will be installed?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  Each of the five (5) systems will be located in the buildings and rooms as annotated below:<BR>	System #1  Bldg 3415, Room 1: 250 SF, Room 2:  250 SF, and Room 3:  250 SF<BR>	System #2  Bldg 2436, Room 1:  360 SF and Room 2:  105 SF<BR>	System #3  Bldg 2436, Room 1:  360 SF and Room 2:  105 SF<BR>	System #4  Bldg 2470:  510 SF<BR>	System #5  Bldg 6130:  1,600 SF<BR><BR>QUESTION:  What are the dimensions for the '1 x 1 area identified in C.1.1.1?' For example, is this a meter, foot, etc?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  The measurement should be 1 ft. by 1 ft.  See Amendment 02.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  Is there any flexibility on the tag size requirement?  Example; if the overall size of the tag is less than the overall identified size, but may not match the exact dimensions as specified in the SOW.<BR><BR>ANSWER:  Paragraph C.1.1.6 states 'tag size shall not exceed 2.54 centimeters wide, 2.54 centimeters deep, and 3.15 centimeters thick.'  Therefore, that is the maximum allowable size.  Tags may be smaller.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  Is there currently radio frequency tracking in any of the areas that this system will be replacing, and if so who is the vendor of that technology?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  No.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  C.1.1.13. The purchase shall include a three (3) year warranty on all<BR>parts and labor. Due to the sensitive nature of the equipment that the system tracks, the contractor must respond to requests for warranty service within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving the call. Warranty calls will only be made during normal operating hours of the unit.  What do you mean by respond? email? telephone? on-site?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  Response by email or telephone is acceptable.  If the problem cannot be resolved through either of the aforementioned methods, the Contractor shall provide on-site assistance within twenty-four (24) hours.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  Laser inscription /ArmyDot tags. Minimum 2000 per unit for the 428th FA.<BR>Minimum 9,000 for 434th FA.  Are you referring to a UID Tag?	<BR><BR>ANSWER:  No, the laser inscription/ArmyDot tags are not the same as the UID tag.  See DFARS Clause 252.211-7003 for information on UID tags.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  Section C.1.1.1 of the solicitation makes reference to 'weapons, sensitive items and any other items fitted with aRFID tags.'  Further, Section C.1.1.5 provides for 20,000 tags '+/-'.   Are we correct to assume that our responding price quote should provide for 20,000 tags exactly?  Can you provide any more precision in how large the number of tags might become?  And, can any more particulars of the 'sensitive items and any other items'--including possible quantities of such items--be provided?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  Yes, quotes should provide for exactly 20,000 tags.  Currently, the additional items include Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) and hand held radios.  Exact quantities are not available.  The Contractor shall affix all tags using the same method.  See Amendment 02.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  C.1.1.9 -- Is this something we should address or offer some position on, with anticipation of dealing with networthiness further down stream?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  The requirement for networthiness was removed in Amendment 01.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  For your convenience, would it be helpful for us to include in our proposal document our CCR information?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  No, we are able to access your CCR information.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  The solicitation stipulates that offeror 'shall complete and return with quote' our representations and certifications for FAR 52.212-3.  We have filed our representations and certifications on ORCA.  Should a printed copy be included with our proposal to you?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  No, we are able to access the representations and certifications on ORCA.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  We did not see any pricing guidance in the RFQ for training and ongoing support. It is our intention to submit a quote for these services using standard GSA rates. Is this an adequate method for the purposes of this response?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  Training and ongoing support, to include warranty services, shall be included in the Contractors lump sum price.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  We have found there is no way for a handheld reader to read 1200 feet.  We<BR>have spoke to the leading UWB manufacture MSSI and this agreed with this<BR>assessment.  Can this be downgraded to 600 feet?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  The specifications are correct as stated. <BR>

<DESC>N65236-08-R-0210-0004- 26 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions and provide clarificationfor this requirement.  The hour and date specified for receipt of offer isherebyextended to 02 October 2008 at 1400 EST. The original market survey andresulting solicitation both referenced the government's requirement for bothdata and audio signal supportability. Offeror must acknowledge receipt of thisamendment prior to the offer due date listed herein in writing.  A simplestatement acknowledging receipt of amendment 0004 is sufficient.1. It is impossible to know whether the screws are fixed or rotate on the 9-pinconnector picture posted. Can you post one with a side or angled view?Answer: No other views are available.2. The connector that you have called a DE-9F is properly designated as DE-9S.Answer: The 9 pin connector attaching mechanism required by the governmentin accordance with this solicitation is the same attaching mechanism per NSN5340-01-522-1658 stated in the solication.3.The drawing (W5007-1) is incomplete since there is no wiring diagram. Thiscable cannot be produced without it. The wiring diagram might be contained inthe drawings listed in Note 16. Can you post these?Answer: The government is not asking the offorers to build W5007-1.  Thegovernment reminds the offorers that the Harris Part number for the cable is12041-72320-A18 meets the governments requirements and may be used forreference.  The government recommends that any wiring questions be directedto the OEM.4. According to this drawing (W5007-1)  the audio is not carried through thecable under the solicitation. It is a data only cable. Audio is carrriedthroughconnectors P10 and P12 which must be connected to the radios to get audio.Answer: The government acknowledges that the audio may be carried throughconnector P10 and P12.  But that is not what the government requires.  The DB-9/DE-9 is capable of carrying the audio functionality in lieu of utilizing theP10and P12 on W5007-1.  The government's requirement is for a single cable thatsupports both data and audio signals.5. The SPAWAR cable drawing that posted (W5007-1) handles data on a 9-pinD connector and audio on a separate 6-pin connector. Therefore, the cable(requested under this solicitation) connecting the radio to the SPAWAR cablewould have to have two legs, one for audio and one for data. The 9-pinconnectors on the SPAWAR cable, according to Note 12 on the drawing only use3 pins (2,3 and 5), therefore they cannot carry both audio and data. So whatyou call a Audio and Data Cable is not possible as provided in the solicitationdrawing. Therefore, you have 2 options: (1) reconfigure the cable you want bygiving it 2 legs, one for data and one for audio; or (2) if you still want asingleleg cable as shown in the solicitation, it would have to plug into anothercabledifferent from the SPAWAR one, where a mating 9-pin connector would handleboth audio and data.Answer: See answer to question 4 above.25 September 2008- Drawings posted for SPAWAR W5007-1 CableN65236-08-R-0210-0003- 25 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions. Any questionssubmitted after the posting of this amendment may not be answered.  Thehour and date specified for receipt of offer is hereby extended to 29September 2008 at 10:00 AM EST.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of thisamendment prior to the offer due date listed herein in writing.  A simplestatement acknowledging receipt of amendment 0003 is sufficient.1. Question: Are you specifying a connector with pins as opposed to sockets,i.e., a DE-9P, and that has female type locking screws?Answer:  There are no pins in the DB-9/DE-9.  The government requires thefemale type locking screws.  The Government does not understand theconfusion.  The specification states under 4.1.1- "jackscrews with female typeends, standoffs threaded, spacing (NSN: 5340-01-522-1658)".  A picture of the9-pin connector is posted to the e-commerce site.2. On page 1 of the drawing, note 4.1.3 indicates that the cable should exittoward the bottom of the radio. It appears that the Harris version of the C-600connector exits toward the bottom which would cause interference. Can weassume that Note 4.1.3 is in error?Answer: Paragraph 4.1.3 on Page 1 of the drawing on the e-commerce sitestating "Cable shall be designed to flow towards the bottom of the radio, notthe top, after connector "B" is connected to the radio" is the requirement.Thisis not an error.3. How many cables are currently connecting the radio to the TOCNET system?What are the part numbers for those cables?Answer: One cable currently connects the radio to the TOCNET System.  It is theSPAWAR W5007-1 Cable.  There is not a commercial part number for thatcable.  The interface to the existing cable is via the DB-9/DE-9 connector. TheSPAWAR W5007-1 cable will be connected to the cable assembly procuredunder this solicitation.  The Harris part number for the cable assembly beingprocured under this solicitation is 12041-72320-A18.4. Will vendors that offer a 32pin connector with dimensions greater than thosespecified in section 2.2.2 on page 1 of the drawing pass the technicalevaluation?Answer: Vendors will be evaluated on their compliance with the specifieddrawing, as well as, the function of their cable.Posted picture of 9-pin connector-24 September 2008N65236-08-R-0210-0002- 23 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions, update drawing for rev2 and provide clarification for other issues.Questions:1)The end "A" connector described on the drawing specification, para. 4.1.1,states a DB-9F, which is a 25-pin connector. The required 9-pin connectorshould be a DE-9S or DE-9P.Response: This was a typo.  Paragraph 4.1.1 should state DE-9F ( where F isfor Female). We need the 9-pin connector.  See http://www.nullmodem.com/DB-9.htm.  The "DB-9F" is not a 25 pin connector.  It is the Government'sunderstanding that the 9 stands for the number of pins.2)The solicitation spec and para. 4.1.1 of the drawing both state jackscrewswithfemale type ends while the drawing shows jack posts.Response: The drawing shows jackscrews with a female type (as stated in thespecs and para. 4.1.1).  Jack posts are not required.3)The specification states that the cable shall flow toward the bottom of theradio, yet the drawing spec shows pin 29 of the 32-pin connector located in away that would cause the cable to flow toward the top of the radio, since pin29is next to the connector key which is toward the top of the radio.Response:  The connector on our drawing should show pins 29 and 32 locatednext to the connector key.4) Please provide a cable assembly in order to create a schematic.Response: The Government does not have a cable assembly available.  This isthe first time these assemblies have been purchased.  We currently haveradios in theater without the appropriate cable.5)Please provide Ohmmeter readings for the pins.Response: Please contact the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) forOhmeter readings of the radio. The radio is a type 1 encrypted device.SPAWAR does not have the authority to release proprietary data about theradios.6) The gauge size of the cable used is 28 gauge.  Can you please advise why20 gauge is being specified?Response: The 20 gauge is correct.  For this cable, the government requires 20gauge cable.7) Do we have a part number for the cable.Response: No.8) What is the purpose of the contract number listed on bottom right of thecable specs documentResponse:  Disregard.  The contract number is not applicable to thisprocurement.The hour and date specified for receipt of offer remains 26 September 2008 at2:00 PM.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to theoffer due date listed herein in writing.  A simple statement acknowledgingreceipt of amendment 0002 is sufficient.N65236-08-R-0210-0001- 22 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to revise the solicitation specifications anddrawing, request a product sample of the cable, and answer questions.1.  The detailed specifications and drawing are revised as attached (DATA-REMOTE CONTROL CAB Rev 1.pdf).  Disregard all other drawings andspecifications.2. Under the "Additional Specifications" listed in the combinedsynopsis/solicitation, the cable length shall be 18 inches (shielded) insteadof12 inches.3. A product sample shall be delivered to Tiffany Boatwright in care of NancyStraight, Code 5.3.1.5.0, SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, 1639 Avenue B North,North Charleston, SC  29405-1639 no later than 26 September 2008.  Thetracking number for this sample shall be sent along with your proposal no laterthan 2:00 PM EST on 26 September 2008. The Government will not pay anyshipping costs related to the submission of the sample.  The product sampleshall be tested by the Government to determine technical acceptability.4. Questions and Answers  Question A. The cable length shall be 12 inches.  What is the (wire)gauge of that?Answer A: The cable should be 18" long, and 20 gaugeQuestion B:  Under 4.1.2, End B connector- Who is the manufacturer?Answer B: End B connector- Harris and AMTI are the only manufacturers knownby the Government. End A, the DB-9, is a common connector made by manymanufacturers.5. The hour and date specified for receipt of offer is hereby extended to 26September 2008 at 2:00 PM.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of thisamendment prior to the offer due date listed herein in writing.  A simplestatement acknowledging receipt of amendment 0001 is sufficient.Drawing and Specifications attached-17 September 2008This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented withadditional information included in this notice.

<CONTACT>BAA Coordinator, Email BAA08-58@darpa.mil
<DESC>Amendment 1 to DARPA-BAA-08-58 Coal To Liquids

The purpose of Amendment 1 to DARPA-BAA-08-58 Coal To Liquids (CTL) is to delete the third paragraph of Section 1.1 entitled Program Overview and replace with the following:

Delete:  SECTION 1.1 PARA 3 :

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently uses on average over 300,000 barrels of petroleum based liquid fuels per day. In addition, the United States has over 275 billion tons of estimated coal reserves. Thus it is a reasonable expectation that, with existing CTL technologies, the DoD need for liquid fuels could be met using U.S. coal reserves for several thousand years.

Replace with: SECTION 1.1 PARA 3:

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently uses on average over 300,000 barrels of petroleum based liquid fuels per day. In addition, the United States has over 275 billion tons of estimated coal reserves. Thus it is a reasonable expectation that, with existing CTL technologies, the DoD need for liquid fuels could be met using U.S. coal reserves for several thousand years.

Rationale for Greater than (>)Thousand year Estimate:

The greater than (>) thousand year estimate is based on neglecting current domestic use. Even so, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently uses on average over 300,000 barrels of petroleum based liquid fuels per day. The United States currently has an estimated 275 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves. Conversion of these reserves using existing CTL technologies would provide several thousand times more fuel than the DoD uses in a single year which is where the greater than (>) thousand year estimate was derived. However, if DoD only used 10% of the converted coal to liquid fuel, this would still represent more than a one hundred year supply which is still significant.

Introduction<br/>
<br/>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  <br/>

<br/>The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement for establishing large scale, coordinated Systems Biology Programs that utilize a combination of computational and experimental methodologies to conduct research Projects to analyze, identify, quantify, model and predict the overall dynamics of the network of cellular molecular components of microbial organisms and their interactions with the host cells.<br/>
Description<br/> 

<br/>Each research Project of the Systems Biology Program shall concurrently utilize multiple high-throughput ?-omics? technologies to generate a diversity of experimental data. These experimental data shall be collected and integrated to develop and/or validate computational models of the molecular interaction networks involved in the biological processes under investigation.<br/>  

<br/>The resources generated by the System Biology Program shall be made publicly available and easily accessible to the scientific community through public data, software and reagent repositories and through web portals The ultimate goal of the Systems Biology Program is to enhance knowledge of the overall complexity of the biological, biochemical and biophysical molecular processes in microbial organisms and host cells which may lead to the initiation and progression of infectious diseases. Such information should identify novel, unique, as well as common molecular signatures that may represent future targets for intervention and could aid in the identification of emerging pathogens and in the development of antimicrobial drugs, immunotherapies, vaccines and diagnostics for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, thus potentially translating basic research findings into clinical applications.<br/>

<br/>It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about September 15, 2008. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  10.45 FTEs.<br/>

<br/>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This BAA will be available electronically on/about August 15, 2007, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.<br/>

<DESC>THE PROPOSAL RECEIPT DEADLINE IS CHANGED TO 4:00 PM LOCAL TIME, DECEMBER 21, 2007.
Introduction<br/>
<br/>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  <br/>

<br/>The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement for establishing large scale, coordinated Systems Biology Programs that utilize a combination of computational and experimental methodologies to conduct research Projects to analyze, identify, quantify, model and predict the overall dynamics of the network of cellular molecular components of microbial organisms and their interactions with the host cells.<br/>
Description<br/> 

<br/>Each research Project of the Systems Biology Program shall concurrently utilize multiple high-throughput ?-omics? technologies to generate a diversity of experimental data. These experimental data shall be collected and integrated to develop and/or validate computational models of the molecular interaction networks involved in the biological processes under investigation.<br/>  

<br/>The resources generated by the System Biology Program shall be made publicly available and easily accessible to the scientific community through public data, software and reagent repositories and through web portals The ultimate goal of the Systems Biology Program is to enhance knowledge of the overall complexity of the biological, biochemical and biophysical molecular processes in microbial organisms and host cells which may lead to the initiation and progression of infectious diseases. Such information should identify novel, unique, as well as common molecular signatures that may represent future targets for intervention and could aid in the identification of emerging pathogens and in the development of antimicrobial drugs, immunotherapies, vaccines and diagnostics for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, thus potentially translating basic research findings into clinical applications.<br/>

<br/>It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about September 15, 2008. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  10.45 FTEs.<br/>

<br/>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This BAA will be available electronically on/about August 15, 2007, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.<br/>

********************************************************************************************

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure a Multi-Function Display (MFD) System in support of PMS 500?s DDG 1000 Program.  The tasks cover design, fabrication, testing and delivery of the production representative model, as well as support for integration, installation and checkout.  Upon successful completion of developmental test, integration test and first article test the Government may exercise contract options for production and fielding of seven systems and spares.  A competitive 100% Small Business Set Aside is anticipated.
The MFD program objective is the acquisition and initial support of an integrated display that will provide three different visual cues for day and night helicopter operations on DDG 1000 class ships.  The visual cues integrated into the MFD include the flight deck status display, a horizon reference display and an Aircraft-Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) System position display.  The MFD will communicate with the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) Network through redundant Distributed Adaptation Processors (DAPs) to receive ship?s roll stabilization signals from NAVDDX and to update settings such as deck status and lighting intensity to accommodate a variety of meteorological and lighting conditions for flight operations.  The system will be controlled by command signals from a remote operator.  The operator interface will be a Common Electronic Display (CED) provided by the ship builder and located in the Helicopter Control Station (HCS).  Commands will be received by the MFD via the TSCEI and DAPs.  Emergency operation and maintenance capability will be provided via a hard-wired maintenance control panel provided as part of the system.  The MFD program will involve designing, building and testing a production representative system in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the DDG 1000 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and to demonstrate conformance to the MFD System Specification with the option to purchase production systems.  The MFD contract is a portion of the next generation suite of Visual Landing Aids which will be incorporated into the DDG 1000.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to the companies that respond to the FedBizOpps synopsis, as well as those companies on the solicitation mailing list.  Because the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the solicitation package is mailed.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a company?s CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.
Award will be based on a determination of ?Best Value?, which may require discussions with the offerors. The evaluation factors will be Technical, Experience, Past Performance, and Price.  Copies of DD Form 2345 and request for copies of the solicitation shall be forwarded to Mr. David Andreoli, 732-323-5208, david.andreoli@navy.mil, fax # 732-323-7440.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p>We at Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) imagine and envision a world in which information is virtual and on demand with global reach. Information is protected by identity based capabilities that allow users to connect, be identified, and access needed information in a trusted manner. It is a world in which United States military forces can deploy and connect no matter where they are located, pull information needed for their missions, and be given timely, accurate information on any threats they may face. It is a world with no seams between the sustaining base and the tactical edge so that operational agility is enabled. It is a world in which the United States military can freely exchange information routinely with coalition partners and others responsible for the security and defense of the United States. The technology employed is agile, adaptive, and capabilities-based. And, we imagine and envision a world in which our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are equipped with capabilities and services that are state-of-the-art.</p>

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) at Scott Air Force Base, IL intends to issue a sole source modification to AT&amp;T Communications, Government Solutions, 1900 Gallows Road, Vienna, VA 22182. The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of the work performed by AT&amp;T under contract DCA200-97-D-0054 that was competitively awarded in February 1997. This modification will: 1) extend the period of performance of the contract from 01 December 2008 through 30 November 2009 with two additional six month option periods through 30 Nov 2010, and 2) increase the ceiling dollar amount by $62.3 million, from $177 million to $239.3 million. The DISN Video Services-Global (DVS-G) system is in the process of being replaced and upgraded by DISN Video Services-II (DVS-II). This modification will provide the continuation of current work and the transitioning of current customers to the new system when DVS-II becomes fully operational. AT&amp;T owns and operates the equipment and proprietary software for the existing DISN Video Services under the DVS-G contract. The Network Operations Center is located in an AT&amp;T facility in Dranesville, VA. The government is unable to turn operations over to another vendor since AT&amp;T owns the equipment. AT&amp;T is the only vendor able to incorporate both dial-up and dedicated Video Teleconference Facilities (VTFs) and provide classified support at the level of security required in the timeframe available. To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DoD cannot afford any disruption of DVS-G services. AT&amp;T provides this secure service at a reliability of 99.6% on dedicated transmission links. The above contract actions will be awarded sole source to AT&amp;T based on their unique ability and capability to maintain the current video teleconferencing (VTC) services system. All delivery orders processed under the DVS-G contract are, and will continue to be, non-synopsized, sole source orders per the original fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. See Numbered Note 22. All inquiries regarding the sole source modification shall be submitted electronically and directed to Patricia E. Hilton, Contract Officer, at Patricia.Hilton@disa.mil, or Tricia L. Singler, Contract Specialist, Tricia.Singler@disa.mil. North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) code 517110 is applicable to this acquisition.

<AWARDEE>SG Construction Services Inc, 3407 Torrey Rd, Flint , MI 48507-3253 US
<DESC>The USPS Leased Space Accessibility Program (LSAP) typically consists of small scale handicap improvements to leased facilities throughout states of the mid-west.  Projects are awarded in groups of approximately 30 to general contractors pre-approved by USPS .  The buildings are predominantly wood framed structures with masonry or wood constructed bearing wall, with steel framed buildings tending to be located near major metropolitan areas. The improvements typically consist of:

PLUMBING:
Replacement of faucets, drinking fountains, installation of sink waste line insulation, water coolers, and occasionally the construction of a new restroom tying into existing services. 

CARPENTRY:
Modification of custom wood framed customer counters, installation of manufactured customer counters and tables, replacement of doors, closers and hardware, installation of restroom grab bars and occasionally the construction of exterior ramps.  Finish work is limited to repairing adjacent wall and floor finishes.

ELECTRICAL
There are no major upgrades.  Work is limited to capping unused outlets, reconnecting countertop equipment and an occasional new wired outlet.

PAVEMENTS
Work consists of limited replacement of damaged asphalt and concrete pavements, parking striping, installation of non-illuminated pole signs, and the occasional construction of concrete ramps with handrails.
