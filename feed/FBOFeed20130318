This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<SUBJECT>Medicare Part A Provider Cost Report Appeals (MPAPA)
<SOLNBR>HHSM-500-2013-RFP-0030
<CONTACT>Edward M. Rutherford, Contracct Officer, Phone 4107866648, Email edward.rutherford@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>Sources Sought Notice # SS-CMS-2013-130168 was posted on 8/31/2012 for this anticipated procurement. The Government intends to post the solicitation within 30-days of this posting.
<p>History:</p>
<p>Section 1878 of the Social Security Act established that providers may request and receive a hearing before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board [PRRB] for a cost reporting period for which a provider filed a Medicare cost report. The contractor's Notice of Program Reimbursement [NPR] is final and binding unless a timely request for a hearing is filed with the PRRB [see 42 CFR &sect;405.1835] or the Intermediary Hearing Officer [see 42 CFR &sect;405.1811] and a decision is rendered, or unless one of the provisions for reopening in 42 CFR &sect;405.1885 is exercised. Therefore, the NPR is the base determination for appealing a cost report.</p>
<p>Under 42 CFR &sect;405.1835, individual providers may bring an appeal before the PRRB if the amount in controversy is $10,000 or more. Under 42 CFR &sect;405.1811, providers may request an Intermediary hearing if the amount in controversy is at least $1,000 but less than $10,000. Under 42 CFR &sect;405.1837, providers may request a group appeal of a single issue involving a question of fact or interpretation of law, regulations, or CMS ruling, which is common to all providers in the appeal as long as the aggregate claims in dispute total at least $50,000. Additionally, providers under common ownership or control which have an issue in common must file a group appeal if the amount in controversy is, in the aggregate, $50,000 or more. A request for hearing must be filed with Intermediary Hearing Office or the PRRB, as appropriate, within 180 calendar days from the date of receipt by the provider of the NPR.<br />This contractor will represent the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and it's Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) with respect to PRRB appeals.</p>
<p>Work Description:</p>
<p>The MPAPA Contractor will be expected to perform the following activities.</p>
<p>1. Coordinate Medicare Part A Cost Report individual and group appeals before the PRRB. This includes, but not limited to:<br />a. Managing the appeal workload <br />b. Working with MACs regarding appeals<br />c. Preparing and reviewing jurisdictional briefs<br />d. Reviewing and approving position papers<br />e. Communicating with the provider or provider's representative<br />f. Preparing and approving appeal resolutions when issues are resolved prior to a hearing<br />g. Preparing for hearings<br />h. Providing legal staff for hearings<br />i. Post hearing briefs<br />j. Working with Office of General Counsel when necessary</p>
<p>2. Provide a hearing officer and coordinate Medicare Part A Cost Report individual appeals before a hearing officer.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates issuance of a Cost Reimbursement-type contract under the forthcoming solicitation. However, CMS does reserve the option to use any other procurement instrument as deemed appropriate at the time of the official solicitation.</p>

<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided herein.</p>

<DESC>- <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY</span></strong>. This work (HITECH Audit Support) will be done as modification 000003 to an existing contract, GS-23F-0133M/ HHSM-500-2012-00042G that was awarded to FIGLIOZZI AND COMPANY. IAW FAR Part 8.4, this contract was competitively awarded on April 16, 2012 and approved to be awarded as "Time and Materials". The main goal of the HITECH Act is to improve the nation's health care through the adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and promotion of the meaningful use of EHR via incentive payments. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) expects that "meaningful EHR users" would demonstrate each of the following: meaningful use of a certified EHR, the electronic exchange of health information to improve the quality of health care, and reporting on clinical quality and other measures using certified EHR technology. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), along with CMS, has identified criteria to define meaningful use of EHR.<br />In the early stages of meaningful use, Eligible Professionals and Eligible Hospitals will attest that they are meaningful users of EHRs. Upon attestation, they will be eligible to receive an incentive payment. <br />CMS has been tasked to design and develop the necessary systems functionality to enable implementation of the HITECH Act. CMS Office of Financial Management (OFM) is responsible for auditing various components of the HITECH program, and oversees the audit process and the contractor is needed to perform the actual audit of the "meaningful EHR users".<br />CMS is responsible for providing oversight of the types of organizations listed above. CMS's oversight of "meaningful EHR users" is a monitoring control process designed to ensure they are in compliance with regulations established within applicable HITECH law, and therefore eligible to participate in the incentive program.
<p>Upon the completion of the audit, the contractor is required to communicate non compliances identified to the organizations or personnel. CMS Management will evaluate the evidence in order to make a final determination of each "meaningful EHR users" eligibility.</p>
<p>The ARRA specifies that CMS shall commence making payments effective January 1, 2011, or as soon as CMS systems are capable. The audit process will need be started soon after the first payments are made.</p>
<p>The Government awarded a Times and Material contract. No other contract type is suitable for this effort. At the time, it was not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. The Project Officer has not been able to accurately estimate, with a reasonable degree of confidence, the amount of time required to complete the effort.</p>
<p>The contracting officer is aware and intends to require appropriate Government surveillance of contract performance in order to give reasonable assurances that efficient methods and effective cost controls are being used. The contracting officers intends to request periodic floor checks be performed by the CMS cost pricing staff in order to meet this requirement.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to extend the ordering period from May 8, 2013 to October 8, 2013 and increase the maximum ordering value of the Electrical Systems Engineering Services Interim contract (ESES Interim) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract (NNG10CR08C), for the Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate (AETD) from $238,693,353 million to $288,693,176 million. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the services from Muniz Engineering, Inc. (MEI) on a sole source basis to ensure continuing performance of mission-critical support currently provided through task orders issued under the ESES Interim contract until a competitive follow-on contract can be awarded. Extending the ordering period and increasing the maximum ordering value of the ESES Interim contract will avoid unnecessary duplication of effort as the competition for a follow-on contract (ESES II) is already in progress. MEI, as the current incumbent, is the only responsible source qualified to perform this requirement due to its current performance of tasks related to numerous complex NASA flight programs such as Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Magnetospheric  MultiScale (MMS), Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), SoilMoisture Active-Passive (SMAP), Soft X-Ray Spectrometer (SXS) for the Astro-H mission, and the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), which have critical schedules that must be met. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)Only One Responsible Source. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Kelly Jonas, via email at Kelly.D.Jonas@nasa.gov, not later than 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on April 1, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The installation Ombudsman is Nancy A. Abell. Ms. Abell may be reached by telephone at 301-286-5867, or by email at Nancy A.Abell@nasa.gov.

<DESC><p>The objective of this project is to provide and install an L-shaped horizontal duct system referred to as the "wind tunnel." The wind tunnel is to be used as a test bed to assess and improve flow measurement capabilities in industrial applications. <br />The Contractor shall supply all labor, material, equipment and tools to perform the work in the Statement of Work (SOW), design drawings, and project specifications. The wind tunnel is comprised of five different sections: Air Intake Section; Reference Section; Corner Section; Test Section; And, Fan Section.<br />a. AIR INTAKE SECTION: Air intake module consisting of a rectangular enclosure with an opening on one side to allow air into the system, and a transition on the other side to mate with NIST provided fiberglass bell (or cone). The cone connects to the 36" Reference Section provided by NIST. The air intake section is equipped with intake louvers, open/close damper(s) with actuator(s) access doors and service light. The Air Intake Section must be surrounded by a fence to prevent unauthorized access and to prevent debris and other items from being drawn into the system. <br />b. REFERENCE SECTION. The 36" dia. Reference Section Piping material is Government-furnished Contractor-installed (GFCI). GFCI material includes piping, flanges, gaskets, bolts and nuts. The Test reference section piping is sloped at the rate of 1/8" per foot in the direction of flow and is attached to concrete footings (outdoors) or bolted to the floor (indoors). The Contractor shall supply 2 additional pipe stands (spares) for the Reference Section.<br />c. CORNER SECTION. The Corner Section is fabricated and installed by the contractor to join the 36" dia. Reference Section piping and 48" Test Section piping. The Corner Section is supported with pipe stands so that it can stand alone (i.e., without the support of neighboring pipes). After assembly the corner must withstand any forces and/or torques caused by air flow.<br />d. TEST SECTION. The 48" dia. Test Section Piping material includes Contractor furnished and Government furnished material to be installed by the contractor. Only the flanges, gaskets, bolts and nuts are GFCI. All other materials are furnished by the contractor. The test section includes one telescoping pipe section with adjustable length between 6 to 10Ft (Minimum of 4 Ft. range). The 48" piping supports inside the building are movable to allow interchange between the different pipe sections and the installation of various flow restrictors. The Contractor shall supply 2 additional pipe stands (spares) for the test section piping.<br />e. FAN SECTION. The fans are located at the exit of the wind tunnel. Their function is to draw ambient air from the inlet into the duct system before discharging the air upwards at the blower exit. Each fan is driven by an electric motor. The fans are sized to producing air velocities ranging from 35 Ft/s (11 m/s) to 150 Ft/s (46 m/s) in the 36" dia. Reference Section; and, producing air velocities ranging from 20 Ft/s (6 m/s) to 85 Ft/s (26 m/s) in the 48" dia. Test Section. The overall system's maximum flow capacity is no less than 64,000 CFM. Fan motors must be suitable for outdoor installation and sized to produce the required horsepower for driving the fans over the specified velocity ranges described above.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue an unrestricted competitive solicitation (N00024-13-R-2203) in the April 2013 timeframe for Trade-Off Studies to support a new class of the Navys Fleet Replenishment Oilers (T-AO(X)), with an option for Special Studies, Analyses and Reviews.  

The Navy requires replenishment oiler capabilities to support Fleet operations across the full range of military operations.  The concept for the T-AO(X) Class ships is to shuttle from resupply ports to station ships (T-AOE 6 Class).  As T-AO 187 Class ships currently do, the T-AO(X) Class will provide the primary fuel pipeline linking Navy ships and their embarked aircraft, with logistics nodes ashore.
  Additionally, when T-AOE 6 Class ships are unavailable, a T-AO(X), in conjunction with a T-AKE 1 Class ship, will operate as a station ship, accompanying and staying on-station with a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) or Amphibious Readiness Group (ARG) to provide fuel as required to customer ships.  

The Trade-Off Studies seek affordable system design solutions that may be considered for the new class while supporting program goals of:  (a) Energy efficiency, (b) Equipment reliability, and (c) Cargo handling efficiency.  DoD initiative, Better Buying Power, challenges industry to design and manufacture products that have the lowest cost of ownership at an affordable price.  

Only contractors with facilities that can support construction of a ship 190-230 meters in length and capable of meeting the technical requirements of a T-AO(X) Fleet Replenishment Oiler are sought for this effort.

Potential Offerors are advised that, in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5230.24, certain TAO(X) technical data will be marked Distribution Statement D - Distribution authorized to the Department of Defense and U.S.
 DoD contractors only. If your firm is interested in participating in this planned procurement, it is advised that prior to the posting of the solicitation you obtain the appropriate authority to participate.  Attachments to the solicitation which are marked Distribution Statement D will not be posted to FBO/NECO.  Therefore, the solicitation will contain instructions to contact the Contracting Officer to receive the specified technical documents.  

This synopsis, any future synopses, the Request for Proposal (RFP) and any Amendments will be posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at https://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.
  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

This pre-solicitation synopsis is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts.  The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis.  If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FBO/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement.  This is not a request for proposals, a promise to issue a request for proposals, or a promise by the Government to pay for information received in response to this synopsis or any subsequent synopses announcing the availability of draft specification for industry participation and feedback.
  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice.  This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.

The Government does not commit to provide a response to any comment or question.

CAUTION:  The solicitation, if any, will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto.  Because of this the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidders mailing list.

It is anticipated that a future competitive solicitation will include a clause enforcing the requirements of 10 U.S.C.  7309, which mandates that no major component of the hull or superstructure of any vessel constructed for the armed forces may be constructed in a foreign shipyard.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, on behalf of the Naval Sea Systems Command and the Navy Virtual SYSCOM (partners NAVSUP, NAVAIR, SPAWAR and NAVFAC) along with other Navy activities, is conducting a rolling admission per the terms and conditions of the SeaPort Enhanced (Seaport-e) Multiple Award Contracts.  The purpose of this rolling admission is to expand the contractor base by awarding additional Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) prime contracts.  Existing Seaport-e prime contractors will also have the opportunity to expand their presence in other geographical zones to allow them to compete for Task Order awards in those zones and to voluntarily re-certify their size status.
  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330 and the revenue size standard for Small Business is $35.5 Million.  

Current Seaport-e contracts have the following 
characteristics:

-Offers are evaluated on Best Value
-ID/IQ contracts with Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Fixed-Price- Incentive (FPI), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee(CPFF), Cost-Plus- Incentive-Fee (CPIF), and Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type Task Orders.  No Time-and-Material (T&M) task orders are allowed.
-All requirements are fulfilled competitively on a task order basis by individual ordering offices.
-Heavy emphasis is placed on Performance Based Orders
-Seaport-e program goal is to award 33% of total obligated dollars to small businesses as prime contractors.
-Large business awards have a minimum Small Business Subcontracting Goal of 20% of the dollars obligated.
-Only one ID/IQ contract award is allowed for individual companies as a Prime; however a contractor may be a subcontractor to multiple Primes.
-Task Orders are competed in one of seven geographic zones (Northeast, National Capital, Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Southwest) based on the place of performance for the solicited requirements.
-Task orders are competed in the zone that is the principal place of performance.
-The basic ID/IQ contracts limits pass-through charges, caps maximum fees, annual escalation, and requires cost savings.

Awards made during the rolling admission process will have the same or similar characteristics.

Oral proposals will not be conducted.
  Awards will be made on initial offers without discussions.

The Government desires an increase in Small Business, HubZone, Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and 8(a) concerns.  Businesses in these categories are encouraged to submit offers as primes.  Prospective offerors are advised that firms certified under small business sub-categories that are competing for inclusion within the Seaport-e Program via Rolling Admissions will be competing only against other prospective offerors certified within their respective small business sub-category.

  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to issue multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) in accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, Part 13 of the FAR to support the Machine Shop operational needs.    Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and services and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements.    All calls/orders must be acknowledged by the selected vendor in order to be retained on the BPA calling list. The Government will not be issuing a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) because this notice will result in BPAs.
  In addition, the Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice.   The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice.  Because the needs of G Department are dynamic, NSWC Dahlgren will periodically solicit additional offers to add new vendors to the calling list.  

This synopsis is open to all business concerns; however, in accordance with FAR 19.501, the Governments intent is to establish BPAs with small businesses. In the event there arent enough responses from responsible, capable small businesses, then large business responses will be considered.  Individual call numbers shall not exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $150,000.
 Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 will be utilized.   The Government reserves the right to add/delete vendors at any time throughout the life of the BPA. There is no minimum or maximum Government obligation.  In compliance with DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (MAR 2008), the government will utilize Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) (https://wawf.eb.mil/)    to electronically process vendor requests for payment.  

Interested parties are requested to provide their Cage Code and DUNS numbers for verification of inclusion in the System for Award Management (SAM).   VENDORS CURRENTLY HOLDING A BPA WITH NSWCDD DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
  Responsibility determinations will also precede issuance of a BPA and will be conducted in accordance with FAR 9.104.  Interested parties are encouraged to address the seven elements of responsibility contained in FAR 9.104 and to complete FAR Clause 52.219-1.  

BPAs will be issued on the basis of past performance.  Interested vendors should provide a minimum of five (5) past performance references.  These references should include name of business, address, phone number, point of contact, contract/purchase order number and item description.  Past performance will be evaluated based upon quality and timeliness of delivery.  The government reserves the right to use additional past performance references if necessary.
  FAILURE TO SUPPLY THE REQUESTED INFORMATION WILL AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO BE AWARDED A BPA.  

Delivery shall be FOB Destination to Dahlgren, Virginia.  All BPA calls/orders shall be issued on a firm fixed price basis.  Companies interested in receiving a BPA shall submit the requested documentation no later than 18 April 2013 to the attention of Dora Fauntleroy, Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5110 or via email to: dora.fauntleroy@navy.mil .

The Government will evaluate and select, for contract award, two (2) or more qualified Offerors, whose proposals are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with consideration given to both the technical evaluation factors and price. <br>  <br> Task orders will primarily address new construction, general building renovation, road and pavement repair, and general environmental work including, but not limited to, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete, and environmental remedial work. Project work may also include force protection and design-build for various construction type projects.  Two (2) or more contract awards under this solicitation are anticipated. This solicitation will cover the geographical area of Albania; however, up to 15% of project work may be performed outside of the geographical area of consideration, including other countries for work that is within the scope of the contract. <br>  <br> This procurement is being advertised on an unrestricted basis, inviting full and open competition.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, a two-phase source selection process will be used to evaluate Offerors for award.

Specific evaluation criteria will be provided in the solicitation documents.   <br>  <br> The maximum contract value shall not exceed US $10,000,000.00 (estimated to be US $2,000,000.00 per year) for the life of the contract, which consists of one (1) base and four (4) option year periods.  The contract will end upon completion of the five (5), one (1) year periods or upon attainment of the US $10,000,000.00 capacity.  Individual projects issued under the MATOC will contain their own estimated values.  There will be no limits on the number of task orders awarded/issued in any year; however, the minimum amount per task order is anticipated to be US $50,000.00 and the maximum is anticipated not to exceed US $5,000,000.00.  The minimum guarantee shall be US $5,000.00.  This amount shall cover the duration of the entire contract (all base and option periods).  The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 236220. <br>  <br> The Government will post this synopsis, the solicitation, and all subsequent amendments through the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Business website to the government-wide point of entry (GPE) Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is the Offeror's sole responsibility to obtain this solicitation and any subsequent amendments through this website. Offerors are encouraged to visit this web site and become familiar with its content and functionality prior to the solicitation issue date.  <br>  <br> The solicitation will be issued on or about 23 January 2013.

The FSCC activity will provide a broad range of integrated and knowledge-driven technical services to FTF focus and aligned missions, host countries (through capacity building), and the Bureau for Food Security, including: 1) state-of-the-art food security support services with a focus on program and project design and management; 2) expert analyses; 3) capacity building; and 4).bridging support and/or small scale pilots.  The services are described below:
1)     Establishment of a Service Center and Network of Experts
The Service Center will mobilize experts, firms and institutions that provide state-of-the-art expertise and training opportunities for host-country needs.  Where possible, it should leverage the expertise, knowledge and programs of USAID-supported International Agriculture Research Centers (IARCs) and Collaborative Research Support Projects (CRSPs) as well as existing field support mechanisms.  Upon start of the award, the Contractor must create a database of experts, including volunteers, who can respond to USAID or host-country specific needs through the end of the award, systematize a process for continuously identifying volunteer experts, and provide orientations to each expert/consultant on Feed the Future and USAID.
2)     On-Demand State-of-the-Art Agriculture Support Services and Expert Analyses
BFS, in collaboration with field missions, recognize the need for a specialized and responsive mechanism to support agriculture development, improved nutrition and resiliency that addresses food security challenges using new technologies and innovative approaches.  On demand from USAID, The Service Center will support core program areas that build host country counterparts and ownership, development of local organizations and USAID capacity, while also providing critical support and analysis for the integration of FTF cross-cutting issues such as gender, nutrition, climate smart agriculture, and resiliency.
3)     Capacity Building
To increase the sustainability of FTF investment, strengthening the human, institutional, and policy framework for agricultural science and technology, including nutrition, is crucial.  This can include building host government or regional economic institutions capacity to create and implement policies that will improve trade, investment, and the business environment, as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations, as well as activities such as developing sector support, or value chain programs, preparing policy & public relations campaigns, or skills training.
4)     Bridge Programs and Innovation Pilots
Ensuring programmatic continuity in the field during a transition to longer-term programming is vital, while rigorous evaluation of pilot activities will generate evidence-based information for a range of practices that can improve food security.  Innovative pilots are critical to FTF and will provide the tangible impact on the ground while demonstrating best practices and how they might work better.  Selection of transition or bridge programs and innovative pilots will be done in close coordination and collaboration with BFS. 

USAID anticipates that competition will be restricted to Small Business only.  The applicable NAICS code for the procurement is 541618.  The anticipated issue date for the solicitation is on or about 15 days from this notice. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available via www.fbo.gov. It is the offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors also will be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), and any other related documents.

<p><br /><br />The F-16 transparency is part of the F-16 canopy assembly which is part of the F-16 aircraft weapon system. The transparency's function is to provide protection, to the pilot, while at the same time providing the pilot visibility while operating the aircraft. The F-16C utilizes two configurations (referred to as CLEAR and SOLAR). The F-16D utilizes four configurations (referred to as CLEAR FWD, CLEAR AFT, SOLAR FWD and SOLAR AFT). See the attached listing of Nouns, National Stock Numbers (NSNs), and Part Numbers (P/Ns).</p>
<p>The Air Force has data and drawings sufficient to qualify new sources. Currently the Air Force is aware of two qualified sources that can produce the F-16 transparency. They are: Texstars Inc. (Cage Code 12849) and Sierracin/Sylmar Corp. (Cage Code 71355). Both of these companies have their own design and have proprietary rights to their design/process. Failure to procure this item from a fully qualified source can result in operational failures that will compromise the mission capability of the F-16 and pose a safety risk to operation and maintenance personnel.</p>
<p><br />Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the described requirement by submitting a "Source Approval Request" (SAR) to the design control authority at AFGLSC (416 SCMS/GUMAE). Interested sources must be deemed qualified through the design control authority listed above. Sources that are interested in qualifying for the production of the F-16 transparencies must be able to demonstrate that they possess the capabilities of obtaining the required technical, engineering, and manufacturing data and that they possess the capabilities to produce these items. Sources interested in qualifying for the production of the F-16 transparencies must be able to maintain facilities and personnel to store, maintain, and operate production systems acceptable to the government. Information received with the submitted SAR must include (1) complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts produced (i.e. salient physical, functional, and serviceability characteristics), and/or (2) evidence that the offered parts have been satisfactorily produced for the Government or the original OEM. This information must be received within thirty (30) days of the date this notice is published. If you have any questions of a technical nature please send them to chad.pauling@hill.af.mil and we will respond as soon as an answer can be obtained.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />Engine Ignition Starter Switch Replacement
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) for the KC-135R/T. There is not a solicitation available at this time. This RFI is published for Market Research purposes only. Participation in this RFI is optional and not required in order to respond to any subsequent procurement this Contracting Agency may take. Any information used will be on a non-attribution basis. Restrictions that would limit the Government's ability to use the information for these purposes are of limited value to the Government and are discouraged. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this RFI. Any information submitted in response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. This RFI is strictly for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. All documentation shall become the property of the Government. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.</p>
<p>PURPOSE <br />The AFLCMC/WKDM Program Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research to determine the cost and schedule for procuring a replacement for its current engine ignition starter (EIS) switch. The purpose of this procurement would be to replace the existing EIS switch with a quick-connect, fully encapsulated switch.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION <br />Each C/KC-135 has four EIS switches located inside the pilot instrument panel. With the current EIS switch design, mechanical movements at the back of the switch are not enclosed and are exposed to debris that may jam and damage the switch. The switch is also difficult to maintain because of the difficulty in soldering wires to the switch within the confined space behind the pilot instrument panel. The switch is NSN 5930011724092. AFLCMC/WKDM would like to mitigate these issues by procuring a fully encapsulated switch, protecting it from debris, which can be quickly disconnected to provide access for maintenance. The new switch must be interface compliant with the existing aircraft configuration. The design should meet all requirements delineated in SAE AS50881for soldering, crimping, and internal wiring.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER<br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review. All responses must be unclassified.</p>
<p>RESPONSE<br />Responses shall address:<br />1. Technical details of design--Include details for both female receptacle (aircraft side) and male connector (switch side).<br />2. Design's estimated cost information (Rough Order of Magnitude) <br />- A-Kit and B-Kit Cost break out <br />- Estimated installation cost with installation hours <br />- Any nonrecurring engineering<br />3. Delivery schedule/product availability of 396 EIS switch kits+40 spares<br />4. Mean time between failure (MTBF)<br />5. Mean time to repair (MTTR)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested firms should also include the following in their response:</p>
<p>- Company Name and address<br />- CAGE Codes (if available)<br />- Point of Contact<br />- Size of Business (i.e. Large/Small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concerns, Minority-owned business)<br />- U.S. or Foreign Owned Entity</p>
<p>Submit response (along with any supporting documentation) directly to:<br />AFLCMC/WKKPA Attn: / William.Loftis@tinker.af.mil<br />CC: / Scott.Masterson@tinker.af.mil<br />3001 Staff Dr. STE <br />Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3020</p>
<p>Or, respondents may respond via electronic transmission (e-mail) to William.Loftis@tinker.af.mil or Scott.Masterson@tinker.af.mil</p>
<p>Questions should be directed to via e-mail or by phone at (405)739-3131 for William Loftis or (405)739-5123 for Scott Masterson.</p>
<p>PLEASE PROVIDE AN ELECTRONIC COPY OF SUBMITTED INFORMATION TO THE POINT OF CONTACT LISTED ABOVE NO LATER THAN 18 April 2013 (30 days from release of Sources Sought)</p>

<a href="mailto:erika.faith.matthews@us.army.mil">ACC-RSA-AATD - (SPS)</a>
<DESC>DESCRIPTION: Using the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct a Research and Development effort called Alternative Engine Conceptual Design and Analysis (AECDA). This research effort is intended to provide foundational ideas/plans for component/subsystem and system level demonstration in support of future Alternative Concept Engine (ACE) program efforts for next generation Army Aviation platforms. Interested sources shall submit proposals in accordance with the guidelines contained in this announcement. This BAA constitutes the only announcement for the AECDA program. There will be no other notices issued in regard to this funding opportunity. Interested sources should be alert for any amendments. <br>  <br> INTRODUCTION: Recently, the Department of Defense (DoD) has concluded that the rotary wing aviation fleet is aging and upgrades to current fleet aircraft will not provide the capabilities required for future operations. Additionally, because of the time in service for currently fielded helicopters, many of the decision points for the future fleet will occur within the next ten (10) years. The Operational Tempo (OPTEMPO) in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) was, and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) is, five times that of peacetime, and much higher than the design usage spectrum, further taxing the already aging fleet. The current fleet of DoD rotorcraft cannot continue to be incrementally improved to meet future operational requirements. Significant improvement in vertical lift, range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and reduced logistical footprint are all required to meet future needs and can only be achieved through the application of new technologies and designs. Operational costs must be reduced to a fraction of those for the current fleet. <br>   <br> The Future Vertical Lift (FVL) Working Group, a joint DoD activity led by the Army Aviation Center of Excellence, is in the process of developing an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) to describe the requirements for a fleet of next-generation rotorcraft known collectively as the FVL family of systems. The capabilities to be defined in the ICD will include combinations of ambient condition hover, speed, range, fuel efficiencies and troop/payload capacities beyond any current rotorcraft.   <br>  <br> Mission requirements for FVL rotorcraft are still in development. Possible missions may include operating in hover at sea level to around 10,000 ft altitudes in hot/cold climates and cruising at altitudes possibly up to 30,000 ft. With such a wide array of missions under consideration for future rotorcraft, a robust, innovative propulsion system design is necessary to meet these versatile, wide operating range requirements.  Moreover, a significant technological advancement in engine/power systems is envisioned to affordably provide the needed performance capability of FVL platforms.  <br>  <br> Similarly, the Army is currently in the process of examining future unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) capability gaps. It is anticipated that future UAS platforms will require alternative, advanced engine/power system configurations that enable enhanced mission capability such as improved time on station, increased mission radius, and quieter operation. Engine/power system improvements in weight, fuel consumption, maintainability, reliability, and noise are all integral to providing future UAS platforms with leap-ahead performance capability. <br>  <br> In order to meet the envisioned leap-ahead platform capabilities, the Army is anticipating the development of new engine/power system concepts to include enhancements to advanced developmental engine/power systems that are more adaptable with wide operating range capability, which provide optimally designed power to weight ratio and specific fuel consumption, while addressing affordability and life/durability. Alternative engine/power system design concepts should consider affordable approaches to effectively manage power, efficiency, and thermal management to provide an optimum, integrated propulsion configuration to meet envisioned attributes of future Army Aviation platforms - both manned and unmanned. <br>  <br> TECHNICAL GUIDANCE: <br>  <br> Technical Description: The objective of this announcement is to conduct a research and development effort to complete conceptual design/trade analyses of various adaptive  and/or alternate engine/power system concepts with various advanced technologies to determine the most promising configuration and suite of technologies to enable significantly improved performance, as a primary factor (specific fuel consumption, horsepower to weight ratio, etc), across the mission spectrum while maintaining high levels of durability, reliability, and maintainability with reduced life cycle cost  for future Army Aviation platforms, as secondary factors.  It is recognized that different technologies/configurations may be more effective/optimum for a given engine/power system size class. Therefore, conceptual design analysis of technologies/configurations may be performed for different engine/power system size classes, ranging from 40 shaft horsepower (shp) - 10,000 shp (i.e., small UAS, scout, attack/utility, or cargo sized engine/power systems).  <br>  <br> Many technologies have the potential to help meet the program objectives including, but not limited to, variable speed power turbines, advanced thermal management systems, hybrid systems, adaptive engine/power system architectures, novel architectures/cycles, more electrical accessories/generators with the ability to turn off certain accessories when not needed or modulate them over a range of conditions, and adaptive component and secondary flow technologies to include inlets and exhausts.  <br>  <br> As part of this effort, the offeror shall develop an ACE concept engine/power system design that will seek to optimize future Army aircraft mission performance (fuel consumption, range, time on station, etc) across the full spectrum of ambient conditions (high hot, high cold, etc). While improved mission performance is a priority, the offeror's ACE concept(s) must also consider system level trades that optimize engine/power system weight, cost, durability, maintainability, and reliability. As such, the offeror shall present well-defined methodologies and analysis techniques to be utilized in their system trades to demonstrate a rationale for why the down-selected ACE concept is the best total system architecture in terms of all design aspects. <br>  <br> The offeror shall provide a detailed analytical data set for ambient conditions around the operational envelope (possible missions may include operating in hover at sea level to around 10,000 ft altitudes in hot/cold climates and cruising at altitudes possibly up to 30,000 ft) to substantiate design and off-design performance of the proposed ACE conceptual engine/power system designs and how each of the key identified component technologies support the overall engine/power system level performance. Certain key identified technologies may also leverage other key technologies in an integrated approach that will yield specific engine/power system level performance benefits. It is important that these integrated performance benefits be clearly identified to substantiate the benefits of, and the emphasis for, development of the key identified integrated component technologies. <br>  <br> The proposed ACE conceptual engine/power system architecture should include advanced technologies that address the anticipated mission needs of future Army Aviation platforms while also identifying potential relevancy to current Army Aviation platforms.  The offeror, in performance of their ACE conceptual engine/power systems design and analysis, should: <br>  <br> -   Emphasize development of technologies that optimize fuel consumption across the power demand spectrum (flatten specific fuel consumption (SFC) curve) <br>  <br> -   Emphasize development of versatile technologies to optimize performance and operability for non-conventional, higher speed rotorcraft under large ambient extremes (cold high & hot high) <br>  <br> -   Assess  development of systems technologies that optimizes platform performance capabilities with minimum installation losses for contemporary environment (e.g. variable output speed, adaptable inlet/exhaust) <br>  <br> This effort shall seek to analyze the quantitative benefits of alternate concept engine/power system designs over traditional engine design approaches to show a clear business case for investing in advanced, alternate concept engine/power systems. Therefore, the proposed effort shall clearly substantiate the proposed benefits and results of trade analyses relative to an identified baseline engine/power system/aircraft for the DoD relevant aircraft/UAV class being addressed (examples include RR 250-C30R3/OH-58D baseline for scout/attack; T700/UH-60 baseline for utility; T55/CH-47 baseline for Cargo class; and AR741/RQ-7or Thielert Centurion 1.7/MQ-1C baselines for UAVs).   <br>  <br> This effort shall also include an assessment of the current technology readiness level (TRL) of the identified most promising technologies and assessments of when each of these technologies would be sufficiently developed to warrant applied research and advanced development funding.   <br>  <br> The offeror shall provide a detailed technology maturation roadmap for their ACE conceptual design in order to support the Army's planned 6.3 ACE Demonstrator effort currently slated to start in fiscal year 2017 (FY17). The technology maturation roadmap shall include detailed component/subsystem level development plans that successfully mature critical component/subsystem technologies to a TRL 4 prior to FY17. TRL 4 is defined as: Basic technological components are integrated to establish that they will work together.  This is relatively  quote mark low fidelity quote mark  compared to the eventual system.  Examples include integration of  quote mark ad hoc quote mark  hardware in the laboratory. <br>  <br> Technology development roadmaps should also depict planned internal research and development (IRAD) or other internal/external funded efforts that support the development of a full suite of ACE relevant component/subsystem technologies to TRL 4 in advance of FY17. In order to obtain cost effective technology maturation to TRL 6, offeror should discuss potential validation plans to perform engine/power system level demonstration of the technologies through the use of existing demonstrator assets in addition to new centerline demonstrators. TRL 6 is defined as: Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond that of TRL 5, is tested in a relevant environment.  TRL 6 also represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness.  Examples include testing a prototype in a high-fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment. <br>  <br> Offeror's identified detailed technology maturation plan shall be accompanied by a set of recommendations relative to the need for specific component/subsystem technology development efforts to enable the offeror's ACE conceptual engine/power system design to meet the intended FY17 timeframe for system level demonstration. The recommendations should prioritize the critical component/subsystem technology development needs to meet the technical objectives of the offeror's ACE conceptual design.  The prioritization process should clearly identify the associated risk and payoffs of the candidate ACE technologies and the criteria used to recommend future investments.  <br>  <br> ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Anticipated Funding for all awards under this program is as follows: $1,200,000 (Distribution FY13-$700K, FY14-$300K, FY15-$200K). It is the intent of the Government to make at least one award, with the potential for up to four (4) awards.  Any award made under this Announcement is subject to the availability of funds. Anticipated Period of Performance: 18 months total (15 technical and 3 for data/final report).  Offerors should clearly depict their proposed schedule.  <br>  <br> TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT: The Government prefers offerors propose a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) and the Department of Defense Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARS), 3210.6R, which is more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments. This does not preclude other funding instruments from being used. A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy. Such instruments include conventional Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented. Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) is also an acceptable funding instrument. Under TIAs or OTs, it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success. Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project. Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DOD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DOD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) is accessible at: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r34p.pdf. The type of funding instrument is a subject for negotiation, but the offeror's desire shall be clearly stated in the cost proposal. <br>  <br> DATA ITEMS / DELIVERABLES: All awards under this Announcement will require a kickoff meeting following award.  In addition, all agreements will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Program Management Plan (delivered 45 days after award), (2) Briefing Charts, (3) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, and a (4) Final Report. (Note: Each of these items shall be delivered in Contractor's format).  All awards under this Announcement will also include a requirement to present the results of the work in a Final Briefing at Ft. Eustis, Virginia upon completion of all technical effort. <br>  <br> SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: This effort will likely generate technical data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only those offerors registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) and that have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this BAA. Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification process. Offerors must submit a copy of the offerors' approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with its proposal.

1.1.1.	This document contains the technical provisions for laundry/linen services that are to be provided to the Memphis, VA Medical Centers located in Memphis, TN and all affiliated Outpatient Clinics.

1.1.2.	The work required by this Performance Work Statement (PWS), consists of furnishing the physical laundry plant (at an off-site location), all labor, supervision, management, management support, supplies, commonized linen and textile items (technical exhibit 1), ancillary equipment, vehicles and materials necessary for accomplishment of complete laundry/linen services, as described in Section 5. 

1.13. Commonized linen services will be provided by the Contractor as described in Section 6.4 Technical Exhibit. This includes scheduled visits to each facility to conduct linen utilization reviews, inventories, establishing and revising linen quotas, providing in-service and an on-line linen ordering system (electronically). This will benefit both the facility and contractor in executing a linen management program, maintaining cost and customer satisfaction.

1.1.4.	All workmanship shall be in accordance with practices/guidelines established by the National Association of Institutional Linen Management (NAILM), International Fabricare Institute (IFI), Textile Rental Services Association (TRSA) and accepted industry standards.  It is intended that services shall include all processes necessary for the laundering and finishing of the articles even though every step involved is not specifically mentioned.  All work shall be performed under sanitary conditions as specified by the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and The Healthcare Laundry Accreditation Council (HLAC).  Physical separation, through the presence of a barrier wall and the use of pass-through equipment is required to maintain positive air pressure in the clean section relative to a negative air pressure in the soiled section.  In no case shall clean and soiled linen share the same physical space.  The Laundry Plant layout/design should incorporate a "design for asepsis" whereby clean linen neither comes into contact with soiled linens nor shares the same physical space, thus avoiding cross-contamination and/or reintroduction of bacteria once processed.  Plants in which the work is done shall be open to inspection of sanitary conditions by Government representatives.  After processing, laundered articles shall be in serviceable and sanitary condition, meeting established quality and performance requirement standards as shown in Section 7.	

1.1.5.

1.1.6.	Notwithstanding the provisions of the contract covering inspection, acceptance, and deduction from payment, any items found to have been unsatisfactorily cleaned shall be re-cleaned at no additional cost to the Government.

1.1.7.	Scheduled services are to be accomplished subject to emergency situations, which may require alteration of schedules.  Emergency situations will be defined by the Facility COR.

1.1.8.	This specification is intended to produce minimal acceptable level of performance.  The Government does recognize the possibility of the Contractor achieving the same or improved results due to innovative approaches, advances in the state-of-the-art materials, equipment and supplies.  Accordingly, provision is hereby made for alterations when a Contractor demonstrates the ability to maintain the standards established herein through use of improved techniques, materials, scheduling, etc. All changes are contingent upon the recommendations of the Facility COR and the approval of the CO or other management official as may be deemed appropriate.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing drop in repair and replacement items for Thermo Fisher Scientific wide range and log and linear safety channel drawer assemblies. These support the Neutron Flux Monitoring System's Log and Linear Channel drawers as well as the Wide Range Linear Monitor drawer which are currently installed in the National Bureau of Standards Reactor (NBSR). This system is designed to be used with compensated Ion Chambers to measure, monitor, and control reactor power.
<p>This is a sources sought notice for market research purposes.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order for the Neutron Flux Monitoring System repair and replacement parts.</p>
<p>If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Monitoring the Neutron Flux is a critical part of operating the NBSR. The main focus of the NBSR is to provide neutron measurement capabilities to the U.S. research community. This focus relies upon the safe and cost-effective operation of the NBSR as well as its ability to operate under and adhere to the licensing agreements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).</p>
<p>Any potential Contractor must provide documentation to demonstrate the established capability to provide drop in replacement parts that have been used successfully for neutron flux monitoring systems used in the control of nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>NIST plans to purchase three new drawer assemblies and three required replacement cards for repairs to existing drawer assemblies. The Neutron Flux Monitoring System shall meet the minimum requirements for a drop in replacement or repair of the existing equipment currently installed and in use in the NBSR. The exact specifications are proprietary as the items were specifically designed for NIST in 2004 and are not sold as commercial "off the shelf" items. The parts requested are repair items for existing equipment as well as spares compatible with the current NBSR user interface.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.</p>

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) is conducting a survey of potential sources for the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) program. NSWC PCD is seeking sources for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) readily-available radars that will satisfy LCAC performance and integration requirements. Upon evaluation of the sources, it is intended to procure several radars for qualification and operational testing.  The primary objective is to identify a replacement radar at reduced cost and increased availability.  The current radar system on the LCAC is at end of life, and replacement units and repair parts have limited availability.
  An increased failure rate may reduce the supportability of the existing system. Due to the inability to support the radar, a replacement system needs to be identified and integrated.   This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for a replacement radar for the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

The synopsis stated base contract with options up to 60 units over 3 year.  <br>  <br> Answer: The requirement has changed from the synopsis to the solicitation. Please disregard the synopsis and follow the solicitation. The requirement is for two (2) Ultra violet Missile Warning Test Sets and options are for up to an additional 18 units.  <br>  <br> Question: In reviewing section B is see the following: Item 001 Ultraviolet Missile Warning Test Set Quantity 2, I do not see an award date or a validity period for this price.  Please confirm the validity period. <br>  <br> Answer: This is the solicitation phase, so the award date is yet to be determined. The validity period for the proposal is six (6) months.  <br>  <br> Question: Item 004 Option: Ultraviolet Missile Warning Test Set Quantity 18.  I do not see an award date or a validity period for this price of 18 units.  I read this as one option for 18 units not step ladder pricing from 1 to 18.  Please confirm the validity period. <br>  <br> Answer: Our intent is to order, over the next 2-3 years, small incremental quantities (1 through 5 each) up to an eventual total of 18. <br>  <br> Question: I do not see anything about 60 units over 3 years in section B as stated in the synopsis.  Please confirm we are only bidding 2 + 18 units for a total of 20 units. <br>  <br> Answer: Yes only bid on the 2 + 18 units for a total of 20 units. The requirement has changed from the synopsis to the solicitation. Please disregard the synopsis and follow the solicitation. The requirement is for two (2) Ultra violet Missile Warning Test Sets and options are for up to an additional 18 units.  <br>  <br> Question: I have read the solicitation document and did not find any Section L requirements for submission.  Is there a preferred format for submission or is the submission acceptable in any contractor format? <br>  <br> Answer: Any submission is acceptable. <br>   <br> Question: The SOW stated Quality must be to ISO Q9001-2008 standards.  Does the contractor need to be ISO Q9001 certified or is it sufficient for a contractor to demonstrate the quality methods are compliant to the standard? <br>  <br> Answer: Demonstration of any quality process equivalent to ISO Q9001 is sufficient. <br>   <br>  <br>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-9843<br />Name:		Self Stick Rectangular Flag, .5" x 1.7", Multi Pack (Red/yellow/blue/green)<br />Description:	.5" x 1.7" self-stick rectangular flags in a multi pack of red, yellow, blue, and green flags. Package includes 4 packs, one each of red, yellow, blue and green. UOI is PG. PG = 4 packs of 35 flags each.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a) , would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected  firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-9843<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	MMM-6834</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List), or Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 11, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<RESPDATE>042913
<CONTACT>Frank Kennedy, Contract Specialist, Email kennedf@onr.navy.mil - Dr. Joseph Doychak, Program Officer, Email joseph.doychak@navy.mil
<DESC>Noise generated by TACAIR engines is an acute noise source and is a concern of the Department of the Navy. Historically, TACAIR engine performance requirements have increased without accompanying noise-reduction requirements, a trend which has resulted in increased noise challenges for the Navy. An understanding of the trades between performance and noise requires data acquired at relevant jet conditions using nozzle geometries of interest. The ability to effectively utilize the knowledge gained requires engineering design tools for noise-prediction validated with relevant acoustic datasets. The program will pursue the acquisition of acoustic data and development of engineering design noise-prediction tools/models for potential future tactical aircraft engine/nozzle architectures.
<p>The Office of Naval Research is seeking proposals that address both (1) the acquisition of noise data for multi-stream, hot, supersonic jets issuing from relevant, complex nozzle geometries and (2) the development and validation (using noise data acquired in (1)) of engineering design models/tools for noise prediction that could be used in future tactical aircraft system studies. The datasets and prediction models should address noise levels for relevant jet conditions at locations on the carrier deck and in the far-field where community noise is an issue. The nozzle geometries of interest are those that accommodate two-and three-stream engine/nozzle architectures including round co-annular and non-co-annular nozzles as well as non-round, vehicle-integrated nozzle configurations. The studies are not intended to include propulsion-airframe interactions. Relevant jet conditions include representative carrier-deck takeoff conditions and an appropriate range of engine cycle conditions expected for operations around airbases. The engineering design tools/models should be computationally efficient and intended for use in system trade studies where a large number of configurations must be evaluated.</p>

<RESPDATE>050313
<CONTACT>Ethan J. Mueller, Contracting Officer, Phone 3016967289, Email Ethan.Mueller@HHS.Gov
<DESC><strong>Request for Information (RFI) Number: RFIFY2013<br />&nbsp;<br />Subject: Agents and/or Approaches for Treatment of New and Emerging Infectious Threats.<br /><br />Key Dates:<br />Release date: 18 March 2013<br />Submission of Information date: </strong>Close of business 45 calendar days after the posting date of this RFI
<p><strong><br />Issued by:<br />Biological Advanced Research and Development Authority</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Government has a responsibility to protect the health and safety of its citizens. The American people continue to face a host of national health security threats from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents and emerging infectious diseases. Under the leadership of HHS, the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) is the coordinating body for the federal agencies in charge of protecting the civilian population from potential adverse health impacts through the use of medical countermeasures, which are medicines, devices, or other medical interventions that can lessen the harmful effects of these threats. The first version of the strategy and implementation plan formed by the Government in 2007 provided a framework for product development successes that were made possible through funding authorized under the Project BioShield Act of 2004. An updated (2012) Strategy and Implementation plan accounts for gains made and further expands the efforts needed to improve national capability and capacity to respond to major public health threats.<br /><br />The 2012 HHS PHEMCE Strategy articulates the strategic direction and will guide policies and decisions for the end-to-end mission of the PHEMCE. The companion 2012 HHS PHEMCE Implementation Plan describes the activities and programs that HHS, in collaboration with its interagency partners, is undertaking over the next five years to increase MCM preparedness for national health security threats. This Strategy and the Implementation Plans together provide the blueprints the PHEMCE will follow in the near-, mid-, and long-terms to make the best use of available resources to enhance national health security.</p>
<p>This Notice seeks declarations of technical capabilities and various information, data, and materials from the public on their interest and ability to develop new or currently marketed therapeutics or prophylactics for mitigation of illness caused by new and/ or emerging chemical and/or biological threats (NETs). Of particular interest are agents that modulate the host innate immune or inflammatory response or otherwise target host factors facilitating pathogenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Description<br /><br /></strong>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make any contract award, nor pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.<br /><br />To date, the focus of the PHEMCE has been on developing, acquiring and stockpiling medical countermeasures (MCMs) to manage potential exposure of the civilian population to specified CBRN threats and pandemic influenza. Key assumptions of this approach are that potential threats will be known or quickly diagnosed, therapeutic agents exist and have been FDA approved for the specific threat, and that it is the function of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to maintain such agents for deployment as needed. Truly novel or emerging threats (NETs) would present significant challenges, particularly if currently marketed and stockpiled MCMs lack efficacy in the treatment or prophylaxis of pathogen associated disease and/ or if rapid diagnosis of the threat was unavailable. The development of MCMs based on augmentation or modification of the host response or other novel mechanisms of action could enhance our Nation's preparedness to respond to NETs and potentially help address the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance while reducing the total cost of maintaining the SNS. <br /><br />Novel therapeutics that augment or modulate the host immune system and/ or specific host inflammatory components may provide benefit in treating a wide array of pathogens. Agents functioning as immunomodulators that reduce the morbidity associated with pathogen-induced inflammation are also of interest. Such treatments or prophylactic agents may have value in treating individuals exposed to a pathogen for which definitive medical countermeasures do not exist. Host-directed therapeutics that lend themselves to empiric treatment in the absence of firm microbiologic diagnosis would offer significant operational advantages.<br /><br />Potential mechanisms may involve approaches focusing on:<br /><br />&bull; Innate defense regulators e.g. defensins and defensin mimetics: host defense polypeptides which are active against fungi, bacteria and many viruses<br />&bull; T-cell control (CTLA-4/ IDO antagonists/ CD28): down regulation of T-cell suppression or up-regulation of T-cell stimulatory factors<br />&bull; Cell surface modification: reducing ability of pathogens to bind to target cells<br />&bull; Vaccine adjuvants: increasing immunogenicity and/ or reducing required antigen levels<br />&bull; Pattern recognition agonists, e.g. TLRs: either as adjuvants or agents up-regulating the immune response<br />&bull; Interferons and other cytokines: as T, B cell stimulatory factors and up-regulation of adaptive immunity and Mx system agonists<br />&bull; Immunomodulators: reduction of cytokines linked to morbidity and extreme inflammation<br />&bull; NK cell agonists that may stimulate innate NK or other null cell activities that result in better and sooner recovery to infectious pathogens in an emergency<br /><br />Compounds that are approved for other indications but which can be repurposed/repositioned as a MCM are of considerable interest as well. <br /><br /><strong>Target Profile<br /></strong><br />The BARDA mission is primarily to focus on supporting advanced stages of MCM development. However, novel treatments and/ or prophylactics at an advanced stage of development for an alternative indication but at an early phase of development as a medical countermeasure will be of considerable interest as well. Agents that can demonstrate a spectrum of use beyond that of the traditional broad spectrum antibiotics and act without overstimulation of cytokine production and are otherwise generally well tolerated are preferred. While the product profile of a drug or biologic in early phases of development may not be known early in the development process, a fully developed, licensable product should:<br /><br />&bull; Have an onset of action within 24 hours of an initial administration<br />&bull; Be indicated for use in adults, pediatrics, geriatrics and in special populations<br />&bull; Have minimal metabolic interactions with commonly prescribed drugs for the general population<br />&bull; Have a stable shelf life of 4-5 years<br /><br />Commercial utility outside of use as a medical countermeasure is also preferred. <br /><br /><strong>Data to be provided:<br /></strong><br />Data from this RFI will assist BARDA in assessing the viability of research and development of antimicrobial agents not focused on specific pathogens and thereby enhancing the nation's biodefense efforts.<br /><br />In Vitro data are acceptable as demonstration of the viability of an approach though results from animal models would be preferred. Data obtained from human clinical trials are welcomed though not required. All in vitro and in vivo data submitted in response to this RFI should be accompanied by a brief summary of findings as well as the description of the model(s) used. Additional data including chemical or immunological characteristics, mechanism of action, proposed formulation and dosage as well as scale of manufacture are welcome. <br /><br />Responders to this RFI may also describe institutional expertise and experience.<br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to make any contract award on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of such information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's evaluation of the information received. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. All responses will be treated as confidential. Any proprietary information should be so marked.<br /><br /><strong>Inquiries<br /></strong><br />Information must be received by no later than the close of business 45 calendar days after the posting date of this RFI.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity intends to solicit a proposal and enter into a contract with PPD, Middleton, WI. The statutory authority for this sole-source is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The FAR citation is 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  <br>  <br> The NAICS code for this action is 325412.  <br>  <br> This requirement is for continued stability testing of existing lots of WR 279,396 (Paromomycin + Gentamicin Topical Cream) and Paromomycin Alone.  Testing will be conducted with existing PPD Methods (Numbers M2079.03, M7067.00, and M7068.01) in accordance with the PWS.  Microbial limit and viscosity testing will be performed at each time point. Stability testing of current lots of product must be continued as long as the product is being used in clinical investigations. Complete stability data packages on all lots of product used in clinical investigations will be submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the New Drug Application (NDA).  It is paramount that the data be consistently collected from a single source using the same test methods. The required testing is currently projected for 24 months, however, an additional 12 months may be required if clinical investigations are not completed on time. Stability data that is available to date has been submitted to FDA for evaluation.  Based on preliminary communication, the Agency indicated they may request further characterization of the impurities identified during stability testing, which may warrant the characterization of the active pharmaceutical ingredients Paromomycin and Gentamicin Sulfate.  <br> USAMRAA requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the SAM and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a DUN & Bradstreet Number. A DUN & Bradstreet Number may be acquired free of charge by contacting DUN & Bradstreet on line at https://www.dnb.com or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The VA Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System intends to negotiate a short term sole source contract with Rozene Development International, LLC, 2323 South 171st Street STE 202, Omaha, NE, 68130-4651, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   Only one responsible source will meet the immediate needs for Seven Community Based Outreach Clinics (CBOC) and One Medical Center within the Nebraska Western - Iowa Health Care System.  The locations are: Bellevue CBOC (NE), Grand Island CBOC (NE), Holdrege CBOC (NE), Lincoln CBOC (NE), Norfolk CBOC (NE), North Platte CBOC (NE), Shenandoah (IA) CBOC, and the VA Med Center located in Omaha, NE.    

This is notice of intent to award a short term sole source under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Note - No award will be issued from responses to this notice. Response to this notice does not legally bind the government in any manner. Your concerns will be considered if you respond to this posting with a similar product/service.  

The justification for this sole source request is based on the Nebraska Western Iowa HCS maintaining their telework services currently being performed at eight locations in order to ensure that veteran patient needs are being met in preparation for both medical and surgical appointments and procedures.  Rozene Development International already has trained and credentialed employees that can fulfill this need on a short term basis until a long term contractual arrangement can be competitively solicited.        
  
All quotes received by 2:00 P.M. Central Time, March 29, 2013, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, or by facsimile at (402) 995-4508.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Feb 2012) applies to this solicitation. The following addenda apply:</p>
<p>Addendum to Paragraph (b)(8) Representations and Certifications - This solicitation is being issued under the premise that the Contractor will certify that the service it will propose to fulfill this requirement is exempt from the Service Contract Act per the conditions set forth in FAR 52.222-48 and FAR 222.1003-4(c). If this is the case and the Contractor certifies that it is exempt under the terms and conditions of 52.222-48, then clause 52.222-51 will flow per usual from this solicitation to the resulting order. In the event that a Contractor does not make this certification, traditional Service Contract Act clauses 52.222-41 and 52.222-43 shall be included in the resulting order award as well as Wage Determinations WD05-2103 (Rev 12) <br />http://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/05-2103.txt?v=12.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in addition to completing the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3(b), the Contractor's proposal shall also clearly show that the Contractor has selected the appropriate certification under FAR 52.222-48 which follows:<br />52.222-48 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification. (Feb 2009)</p>
<p>(a) The offeror shall check the following certification: <br />CERTIFICATION <br />The offeror ____ does ____ does not certify that- <br />(1) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Government purposes, and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontractor) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(2) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of equipment. <br />(i) An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. <br />(ii) An "established market price" is a current price, established in the usual course of trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror; and <br />(3) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract are the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(c)(3) that the Service Contract Act- <br />(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or <br />(2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis. <br />(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision- <br />(1) The clause in this solicitation at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror; and <br />(2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible, if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation. <br />(d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.</p>

<CONTACT>Kate E. Johnson (Zeuschner), Email zeuschnerke@state.gov - Nadia Shokry, Email ShokryNO@state.gov
<DESC>Background<br />The George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training center of the Department of State is the federal government's primary training facility for personnel of the foreign affairs community. The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) is the Department bureau that provides training for employees of the Department of State and  other agencies at the Shultz Center. The Institute's Transition Center offers the High Stress Assignment Outbrief program, which occurs in either scheduled large group sessions (MQ950) or ad hoc individual and small group settings (MQ951). The Outbriefs are designed to be two-way educational programs, combining a psycho-educational component and a structured protocol interview. The facilitator-led psycho-educational section covers the basics of decompression symptomatology, related pathologies, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, resources available to employees and family members, and suggestions for facilitating personal transitions in resuming civilian life, re-entering a more normative work<br />environment, and reintegrating into personal relationships after service in a threatening and demanding overseas assignment. The interview follows a series of questions designed to elicit and collect information on the ever-changing circumstances and experiences of officers deployed to high stress posts.
<p>Purpose<br />The Foreign Service Institute is seeking small business contractors to assist in implementing the High Stress Assignment Outbrief (MQ950 and MQ951). The overall aim of the program is to empower returnees from high threat diplomatic assignments around the world to predict, identify, and respond to the rigors of decompression, and to capture in a non-intrusive dialogue, their suggestions,&nbsp;advice, experiences, and reflections on their assignments for the benefit of the Department and their successors. Contractors are needed primarily to facilitate individual or small group (1-4 people) Outbriefs, but might be called upon for (scheduled) large group (up to 25 people) Outbriefs as well. Additionally, contractors may be asked to develop resource materials, compile scientific research&nbsp;into practicable information, present in conferences, and other duties related to the development, explanation, implementation, marketing, and evaluation of the Outbrief program.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection criteria in accordance with FAR 15.101-2. This is a limited source LPTA best value source selection in which technical acceptability is considered the most important factor. By submission of its offer, the Offeror accepts all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for prices. The Government intends to select ONE contractor for award for this effort. Failure to meet a requirement will result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. For the purpose of award, the Government shall evaluate offers based on the evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 Technical Acceptability (Pass/Fail)<br /><br />To be technically acceptable each item must match the National Stock Number (NSN) and Part Number (P/N) to the items listed in the attached schedule; manufactured new and traceable to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Traceability means the awardee must be able to show clear, documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part from the OEM to the final vendor. Reconditioned or used materials are not acceptable.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 Price</p>
<p>The Government may select the source based upon a best value evaluation of the offeror's technical acceptability and price. Past performance shall be viewed as a responsibility determination. In the event two or more technically acceptable offerors bid an identical total price, the Contracting Officer may evaluate responsibility of the contractor by seeking relevant performance information through sources such AMMIS inventory system at the Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center and records posted on Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Retrieval System (PPRS), or other government data bases and other sources that are available. If an offeror has limited or no record of relevant past performance, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably but rather receive a neutral rating.</p>

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-<br />(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;<br />(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-<br />(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or<br />(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and<br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.<br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:<br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).<br />(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.<br />(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.<br />(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact:

PROVISIONS/CLAUSES:  The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference (provisions and clauses may be obtained via the internet: http://farsite.hill.af.mil): 
The provision at 52.212-1 Instructions to offerors- Commercial applies to this acquisition
52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, technical, past performance and price considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

BASIS OF AWARD:  1) The government intends to issue a firm fixed price contract or multiple awards to the responsible Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation evaluation factors. 
EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the Offer that meets the technical aspects of the solicitation.  Competing offeror's technical aspects will be evaluated as significantly more important than past performance and price considerations. The lowest price proposal may not necessarily be selected; likewise, the proposal receiving the highest technical rating may not necessarily be selected.  Offerors who propose to perform the work for an unrealistically low price will not be considered for award. Where applicable, the techniques and procedures described under FAR 15.404-1 will be the primary means of assessing proposal reasonableness. An offeror's proposal shall represent the offeror's best efforts to respond to the solicitation. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.Offeror's must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: 

A.	Technical: Technical can be measured by the offeror's ability to perform requirements to meet technical, specifications, contract terms and conditions, and all local, state, and federal regulations as related to performing projects. 

B.	 Past Performance Confidence Assessment: 
1) Past Performance, the offeror shall provide relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) the past and present references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources as well as questionnaires. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving contracting support that is similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. Past Performance that does not meet the recency requirement, will be excluded from evaluation. 
2) Past performance will address areas pertaining to the following attributes to which an assessment will be made: 
3) Quality: The quality of work can be measured by how well the offeror conformed to or met contract requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g. commonly accepted technical professional, environmental, or safety and health standards.) 

. 
TABLE 1- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS 
Rating 	Description 
SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
LIMITED CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
NO CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. 
UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE 	No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. 

4) Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offeror's with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating ?Unknown Confidence, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. 
5) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP. For each effort evaluated, a relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners, will be made. In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. The following relevancy definitions apply: VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. SOMEWHAT-RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs did not involve any magnitude of effort and complex.
6) Recent past performance is defined as past performance on contracts within the last three years from the issue date of this solicitation. Past performance for contracts exceeding the timeframe for this definition of recency will be excluded from evaluation. 
7) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a ?Substantial Confidence? performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. 
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

The Technical element of the evaluation will be a determination as to whether the proposed product meets the performance characteristics and specifications in the solicitation. The Technical element of the evaluation shall be based solely on information furnished by the vendor. The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal. To ensure sufficient information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the Government to determine whether the product meets the performance characteristics and specifications of the requirement. If the offeror proposes to modify a product so as to conform to the requirement of this solicitation, the offeror shall include a clear description of such proposed modifications and clearly mark any descriptive materials to show modifications. 

Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual sales of the proposed product to industry or Government agencies.

Offerors shall include three (3) relevant records of past sales from the previous twelve (12) months. Offerors shall identify a point of contact for each sale by providing a name and telephone number.

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and<br />(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)<br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />Lowest Price Technically Acceptable<br />(b) Options.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</span></span></p>

<DESC>Amendment 001 (A001)<br /><br />Questions and Answers <strong>(BOLD)</strong> Q&amp;A: <br /><br />
<p>Q&amp;A <br /><br />Q1. The SOW states that the Contractor shall travel to at least Lagos for a minimum of 7 calendar days. From past experience working in Nigeria it is usually very important to meet with officials in Abuja as well. Depending on the project(s) being developed during the base and option periods totaling many months, the requirement may be to visit other cities, lending a full 7 days in Lagos potentially not relevant. Would USTDA reconsider this minimum requirement and allow the Contractor the flexibility of proposing the number of days in at least the two cities of Abuja and Lagos? <br /><br /><strong><br />(A1) Per the revised SOW, "The DM Contractor shall also travel to Nigeria for a total travel time of at least seven calendar days with at least one destination to include Lagos" for the base period of this requirement and for each option which is exercised.</strong></p>
<p>Q2. The SOW requires the Contractor to provide arrival/departure briefing/debriefing to the U.S. Embassy/Consulate. If a briefing/debriefing with the U.S. Embassy is required a trip to Abuja would be needed. Alternatively, the Contractor could conduct the briefing/debriefing with the commercial section at the U.S. Consulate in Lagos and would not need to travel to Abuja. Would USTDA please clarify the specific requirements regarding a trip to Abuja and any meetings in Abuja?</p>
<p><strong>(A2) Per the revised SOW, "The DM Contractor shall also travel to Nigeria for a total travel time of at least seven calendar days with at least one destination to include Lagos." There are no specific requirements for a trip to Abuja.</strong></p>
<p>Q3. Would USTDA please confirm that the bidders must submit a complete budget for the Base Period and the two Option Periods, e.g. the total potential requirement? <br /><br /><strong>(A3) Yes, the bidders must submit a complete budget for the Base Period and the two Option Periods.</strong></p>

INTRODUCTION <br />1. This is a Sources Sought synopsis being conducted pursuant to FAR Part 10, Market Research. This is for planning purposes only and there is no solicitation available at this time. <br />2. This is an initial step in the planning process for the Electromagnetic Opposing Force acquisition currently titled EM OPFOR. <br />3. The 55th Contracting Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, seeks to identify potential sources to provide Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) expertise and Electromagnetic Spectrum Opposing Force (EM OPFOR) engineering services to the USSTRATCOM Joint Electronic Warfare Center (JEWC) EM OPFOR mission located at Lackland AFB, TX. The mission of the EM OPFOR is to replicate a coherent, realistic EM environment (EME) capable of mirroring adversary and civilian infrastructure in order to train and enhance EM capabilities, processes, and TTP proficiency across the Department of Defense (DOD) and USG, and produce comprehensive after-action reports (AAR) from the findings of these activities/assessments. United States (US) forces must train in a realistic environment as mandated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CJCSI 3500-series joint instructions. The EM OPFOR allows US forces to do that by providing an EME that is representative of what the warfighter will see when deployed (i.e. congested and contested EMS). The EM OPFOR is the dynamic and technically advanced adversary in exercise scenarios (i.e. the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo;). The EM OPFOR deploys to austere locations (training ranges, test facilities, etc.) and creates realistic EME where before there was nothing; thus allowing full spectrum, joint, live-virtual-constructive EM activities to take place. The EM OPFOR deploys and operates current/emergent wireless communications and network technologies to include but not limited to VHF/UHF radios, satellite communications, cellular communications (e.g. GSM, CDMA, EVDO, HSDPA, etc.), wireless communications and devices (e.g. WiFi, WiMAX, cameras, survey tools). They design, implement and operate adversary command, control, communications and computer (C4) architectures in support of customer requirements. EM OPFOR also operates Electronic Warfare Support (ES)/Electronic Attack (EA)/Radio Frequency Direction Finding (RFDF) equipment in order to prosecute US forces and assess potential US vulnerabilities. Moreover, the EM OPFOR is involved in most aspects of the joint exercise life cycle (JELC) specifically: exercise scenario development, scripting, execution oversight, scenario injects and debrief. <br />4. The North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541330 , Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons), which has a small business size standard of $35.5M. <br />B.

<DESC>The Government is considering the sale of forest products. The sale areas will consist of mostly thinning of natural stands where longleaf pine will be the preferred leave trees.  Both pine and hardwood trees will be marked for harvest.  Each individual sale area will be bound by improved roads, creeks (hardwood drains), or trees marked with vertical stripes of RED paint, which will be shown on all sale maps.  The sale areas will be in a variety of locations on the Fort Benning Military Reservation to include Russell County, Alabama; Muscogee County, Georgia; Chattahoochee County, Georgia; Marion County, Georgia.  Sale areas will occur in a variety of terrain, from rolling hills, deep sands, to areas of clayey soils.  All sale areas combined will be approximately 2,000 acres +/-.  The purchaser is responsible for adhering to the sale boundaries as identified on the ground, as indicated on individual sale maps and/or designated by the contracting officer or his/her representative. The purchaser will be responsible for the cutting down and removal of forest products.<br><br>There may be a delay between harvesting areas depending on military training.<br>

<DESC><strong>CHPRC Acquisition Strategy Plan for Option Years</strong>
<p>In a continuing effort to identify project cost efficiencies and bring greater value to the U.S. government, CH2M HILL Plateau Remediation Company (CHPRC) is rolling out its subcontracting strategy for the next five-year option period contract with the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>
<p>Our subcontracting strategy in the first five years of our contract has worked well; however, the economy has changed. In the first five years of our contract, funding for cleanup increased dramatically due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and our teaming subcontractors were afforded opportunities of ten years' worth of work to complete in five years. The subcontracting strategy allowed us to put people to work quickly and expand our operations.</p>
<p>The nation is now in a budget environment where finding efficiencies is critical to maximize the amount of funding available for cleanup.</p>
<p>We anticipate our subcontracting strategy will generate savings between $7 and $9 million per year, allowing us to maximize cleanup dollars while still meeting or exceeding our subcontracting goals at Hanford (at least 17% of the total contract price will be performed by small businesses).</p>
<p>Three Competitive Requests For Proposals (RFPs) are planned for the permanent option period configuration. The roll out of RFPs and announcement of new subcontracts will be issued between late January 2013 and ~May 2013. Transition to new subcontractors is expected to be complete by end of December 2013.</p>
<p><strong>The planned competitive solicitations are:</strong></p>
<p>Decommissioning, Waste and Fuels and Remediation Services (DWFRS) <br />Brief Scope: Performing Decommissioning, Waste, Fuels and Remediation Services to include facility minimum safe and base operations, maintenance and work control for central plateau surveillance and maintenance organization; minimum safe and base operations, maintenance and work control for T-Plant, Central Waste Complex, Low Level Burial Ground, and Waste Receiving and Processing Facility; waste and transportation services; receiving Navy reactor compartments at Hanford.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Release of Request of Expression of Interest: ~ Week of January 28th. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Release of RFP: ~ Week of February 15th</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Construction Support Services <br />Brief Scope: Subcontractor shall be responsible for providing building trades skilled craft, and craft supervision (general foreman or superintendents) necessary to accomplish preventative building maintenance on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. In addition, subcontractor shall be required to provide general field construction support for minor construction activities at various locations on the Hanford site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Release of RFP: ~Week of February 15th</p>
<p>Training and Procedures Support Services<br />Brief Scope: Training support to include analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation of training and qualification/certification programs IAW DOE O 426.2, Personnel Selection, Training, Qualification, and Certification Requirements for DOE Nuclear Facilities. This work scope requires development and maintenance of processes that establish Company training programs, maintain individual training plans, scheduling of employee training, development and implementation of multiple forms of training, and interface and coordination with the site-wide training organization (HAMMER).</p>
<p>Procedure support will include analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation of administrative and technical procedures programs IAW DOE O 422.1, Conduct of Operations. Work scope requires development and maintenance of processes and procedures that establish the Company procedures program, management of change control processes, maintenance of configuration controlled procedures web pages, and continuous interface and coordination with projects/facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Release of RFP: A decision will be made in May 2013 as to final scope and RFP release date.</p>
<br />
<p>In addition to the 3 competitive solicitations, CHPRC is looking for a small business that has the right size standard and economic status such as a certified 8a, Small Disadvantaged Service Veteran Owned or Hubzone business to become part of the DOE Mentor Prot&eacute;g&eacute; program. Possible areas for work scope currently being considered are: Temporary administrative and records management support and summer intern program support. Release of Scope and solicitation for this procurement is still under development.</p>
<p>The CHPRC Current Solicitations page (http://chprc.hanford.gov/page.cfm/CurrentSolicitations) displays CHPRC's current, published Requests for Proposal.</p>
<p>Please visit the Doing Business with CHPRC page (http://chprc.hanford.gov/page.cfm/DoingBusinesswithCHPRC) for information regarding the requirements and expectations for working with CHPRC on the Hanford site.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification, is to update the NAICS code to 541330.  All other information remains the same.  

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue an unrestricted competitive solicitation (N00024-13-R-2203) in the April 2013 timeframe for Trade-Off Studies to support a new class of the Navy's Fleet Replenishment Oilers (T-AO(X)), with an option for Special Studies, Analyses and Reviews.  

The Navy requires replenishment oiler capabilities to support Fleet operations across the full range of military operations.  The concept for the T-AO(X) Class ships is to shuttle from resupply ports to station ships (T-AOE 6 Class).  As T-AO 187 Class ships currently do, the T-AO(X) Class will provide the primary fuel pipeline linking Navy ships and their embarked aircraft, with logistics nodes ashore.
  Additionally, when T-AOE 6 Class ships are unavailable, a T-AO(X), in conjunction with a T-AKE 1 Class ship, will operate as a "station ship," accompanying and staying on-station with a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) or Amphibious Readiness Group (ARG) to provide fuel as required to customer ships.  

The Trade-Off Studies seek affordable system design solutions that may be considered for the new class while supporting program goals of:  (a) Energy efficiency, (b) Equipment reliability, and (c) Cargo handling efficiency.  DoD initiative, "Better Buying Power", challenges industry to design and manufacture products that have the lowest cost of ownership at an affordable price.
  

Only contractors with facilities that can support construction of a ship 190-230 meters in length and capable of meeting the technical requirements of a T-AO(X) Fleet Replenishment Oiler are sought for this effort.

Potential Offerors are advised that, in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5230.24, certain TAO(X) technical data will be marked Distribution Statement D - Distribution authorized to the Department of Defense and U.S. DoD contractors only. If your firm is interested in participating in this planned procurement, it is advised that prior to the posting of the solicitation you obtain the appropriate authority to participate.  Attachments to the solicitation which are marked "Distribution Statement D" will not be posted to FBO/NECO.
  Therefore, the solicitation will contain instructions to contact the Contracting Officer to receive the specified technical documents.  

This synopsis, any future synopses, the Request for Proposal (RFP) and any Amendments will be posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at https://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

This pre-solicitation synopsis is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts.
  The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis.  If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FBO/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement.  This is not a request for proposals, a promise to issue a request for proposals, or a promise by the Government to pay for information received in response to this synopsis or any subsequent synopses announcing the availability of draft specification for industry participation and feedback.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice.  This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.

The Government does not commit to provide a response to any comment or question.

CAUTION:  The solicitation, if any, will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto.
  Because of this the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidder's mailing list.

It is anticipated that a future competitive solicitation will include a clause enforcing the requirements of 10 U.S.C.  7309, which mandates that no major component of the hull or superstructure of any vessel constructed for the armed forces may be constructed in a foreign shipyard.

The intent of the updates is to better communicate the status of ongoing procurements within PEO STRI.  <br>    <br>  Each PALT update session will provide Industry the opportunity to request updates on specific procurements of interest in a Question & Answer (Q&A type forum. There will not be a formal agenda, but rather an open Q&A session not to exceed 45 minutes. It will be up to Industry representatives to request an update on specific procurements of interest. Information to be provided by the Government will be limited to status updates pertaining to specific procurements. The Government will not provide any procurement sensitive information that would violate the integrity of the source selection process.   <br>    <br>  Although minutes/notes for each session will not be provided, a document library has been created on STRIBOP for posting of miscellaneous briefings/presentations  that may be provided during the PALT update sessions.  These presentations can be accessed via the following link:   <br>    <br>  https://bop.peostri.army.mil/sites/bop/PALT%20Update%20Session%20Briefings/Forms/AllItems.aspx  <br>    <br>  New briefings will be posted to the document library within 3 business days after the applicable session.  <br>    <br>    <br>  IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PARKING: Due to limited parking in the Partnership II/III parking lot, all visitors MUST park in the large parking lot on the corner of Science Drive and Technology Parkway.

<DESC><p>Solicitation Notice: Education in Crisis/Conflict-Affected and Fragile Environments (ECAFE)<br /><br />The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau for Economic Growth, Education and Environment (E3) hereby issues a Request for Proposal (RFP) for technical assistance related to Education in Crisis/Conflict-Affected and Fragile Environments (ECAFE) to establish a world-wide support mechanism to USAID Missions and Bureaus in addressing their education objectives in environments that may be, or have been affected, by crisis, fragility, lawlessness and/ or conflict. This RFP solicits support for the attainment of Goal Three of USAID Education Strategy: Increased equitable access to education in crisis and conflict environments for 15 million learners by 2015, per USAID's Education strategy. The Contractor may also be required to provide technical assistance and services to USAID Bureaus and Missions that may include assessment, design, implementation, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation of education programs in crisis/conflict-affected lawless and fragile environments, as well as management and training, research, guidance, and analysis to build the capacity of the Agency and its partners in effectively understanding the role education can play to mitigate crisis, conflict, and fragility.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates awarding multiple contracts as a result of this solicitation, consisting of both unrestricted and small business set-asides. There is no guarantee on the number of contracts to be awarded, the number of task orders that any one firm will receive, or the amount of money each firm is entitled to beyond the minimum monetary amount to be stated in the Request for Proposal (RFP). USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering limitation of the contracts resulting from a RFP will be $500,000,000 over a 5 year ordering period. Note that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate.</p>
<p><br />The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541990.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than 15 days after this notice is issued. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, copies of the solicitation will not be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. Offerors are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement. Telephonic requests or inquiries will not be taken.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate USAID to award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.201.</p>

<DESC>Description* - THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. This opportunity is available only to The Signature Consulting Services, LLC. CMS intends to issue a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Contract (HHSM-500-2011-00003C) on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 19.8 "Contracting with The Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program). <br />The requirements of the SOW are unique and the work is severable. The expertise required in terms of breadth of subject, as well as the depth of subject required limits consideration to only a few contractors who can qualify. By the nature of the activity, operational auditing to access and document readiness and gaps, specific labor requirements can only be estimated in terms of types of labor and quantities of hours, as specific issues to be found are unknown at this time.<br />The ARRA specifies that CMS shall commence making payments effective January 1, 2011, or as soon as CMS systems are capable. The audit process will need be started soon after the first payments are made. An audit support contractor is needed at this time to assist CMS in developing the audit procedures and processes.<br />There are uncertainties involved in contract performance, audit support strategy, that do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy (e.g. historical data) to use any type of fixed-price contract. IAW FAR 16.301-2 the successful contractor will have an adequate accounting system for determine applicable costs, and government surveillance during the performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and sufficient cost controls are being used.<br />In order to meet the aforementioned CMS needs and requirements, CMS intends to award a five year contract (1 year base period with four option years) to an audit support contractor to assist CMS in developing an effective audit process. The dollar magnitude of this contract effort is estimated to exceed $500,000. As required under the HITECH Act, CMS must begin making incentive payments in FY2011 to Eligible Professionals and hospitals for a period of five years. CMS intends to use the audit support contractor to develop an audit process to ensure that payments are accurate throughout the life of the HITECH program.<br />See sources sought notice for 8(a) small businesses, which was posted on 5/15/2010, CMS-2011-8A-0005, for details of notice.<br />

<AWARDEE>Oneida Total Integrated Enterprises, LLC, 317 East Main Street, Ventura, CA 93001 US
<DESC>8(a) Set-Aside<br />The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires professional architect and engineering services to support remedial planning and oversight activities at the Amco and the San Fernando Valley (Areas 1 - 3) Superfund Sites in Region 9. The list of the Potential Responsible Parties (PRPs) will be posted on EPAs web site, along with the announcement at the web site listed below. The services include site management; remedial investigation feasibility studies; engineering services to design remedial actions; engineering evaluation and cost analysis for non-time critical removal actions; construction management for implementing remedial actions and non-time critical removal actions, including issuing and managing subcontracts for construction of the selected remedy and engineering services in overseeing construction; enforcement support, including oversight of remedial investigations/feasibility studies, remedial design and remedial action, and negotiation support; and other technical assistance, including community relations, sampling and analysis support, and pre-design investigations. Services may include technical and management services supporting EPA's coordination and oversight of remedial actions where they are performed by a state, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or responsible parties identified in enforcement actions. <br />This project is an 8(a) set aside. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this procurement is 562910 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. At least fifty (50) percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor. <br />The contract will be firm fixed rate, Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) award term contract. The base period of performance will be three (3) years, with three award terms periods, two (2) year, three (3) years and two (2) years, for a potential total period of ten (10) years. Work will be issued by Task Orders. The total estimated amount of this proposed contract, including award terms, is $80,000,000.00. <br />All proposals will be evaluated in an identical manner and in accordance with the specified evaluation criteria.<br />In the event that firms propose under any type of joint venture agreement, each of the joint partner firms must meet the minimum technical qualifications independently and as a whole combined effort representing the joint venture as set forth in this announcement. The joint venture proposal will be noted as a whole. <br />The contract will be awarded in accordance with the Brooks Act Procurement procedures. For this procurement, EPA requires that the offerors organize the information so as to highlight responses to the technical evaluation factors. Firms interested in responding to this announcement are invited to submit completed Standard Form 330 (SF 330) to the office shown below by 2:00pm PST on July 29, 2011. Responses must be received at the designated Region 9 location by the deadline; postmarks will not suffice. Responses to this announcement, including SF 330 and all attachments, shall not exceed twenty-five (25) separate pages, or fifty (50) pages of text. The 50 page limit is inclusive of both Part I, Part II and any and or all attachments. The response should be double-sided with a minimum of 10 point font, on 8.5 X 11 paper only (no other size page(s) will be allowed). This page limit does not include the cover letter, the front and back cover of the SF 330 or the table of contents. There is no page limitation for any individual section or portion of the SF 330 or attachment(s), the only limitation is the overall page limitation stated above. Offerors shall follow the instructions for completing the SF 330. No alterations of the SF 330 are permitted. Offerors whose response exceeds the page limitation and do not comply with instructions provided will be considered non responsive. Submit one (1) original and six (6) copies, a total of seven (7), and one (1) electronic copy on CD ROM of your response to the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 9, Contracts Section: Attn: Zachary Slater MTS-4-3, 75 Hawthorne St., San Francisco, CA 94105. <br />Pursuant to FAR 36.6, the source selection official has the latitude to consider selection of another of the ranked offerers. Rationale for considering such action could be the Governments goal to provide alternate sources for its requirements, including the mitigation and management of conflict of interest (COI) issues. In the event that firms propose under a joint venture agreement, both firms must demonstrate the ability to implement the requirements of the tasks described in the Statement of Work independently.
<p>The EPA Region 9 is not going to hold a pre-proposal conference. This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). Following EPA's review of the SF 330, a "short list" of the most highly rated firms will be developed. Short-listed firms will be referred to as "selected firms." Selected firms will be invited to participate in oral presentations/ interviews. The specific details on the oral presentations/interviews will only be provided to the selected firms. Oral presentations/interviews will address and augment the firm's technical qualifications. Selected offerors should be aware that their overall rating depends on both written submissions and their oral presentations/interview. Following oral presentations/interviews, the proposals will then be ranked with the most highly rated firm ranked first. The source selection authority will make the final selection from among those firms. The most highly rated firm will be asked to submit a cost proposal, Conflict of Interest Plan, Quality Management Plan and Representations and Certifications. The Offeror shall also be required to have an acceptable accounting system that allows for segregation and tracking of costs.</p>
<p>Selection will be based on the following evaluation Factors which are listed in descending order of importance (for those Factors that have sub-factors the sub-factors are equal in value):<br />Factor #1 - TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE (AS PRESENTED IN SECTION E, G, H, AND PART II OF FIRM'S SF 330)<br />Sub-Factor #1 Fund-Lead Site Specific Work Areas<br />Sub-Factor #2 Enforcement Support Site Specific Work Areas<br />Factor #2 - PAST PERFORMANCE (AS ADDRESSED BY THE PAST PERFORMANCE REFERENCES, SECTION F)<br />Factor #3 - PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS (AS PRESENTED IN SECTIONS E, G, H AND PART II OF FIRM'S SF 330)<br />Sub-Factor #1 Management Personnel<br />Sub-Factor #2 Technical Personnel <br />Factor #4 - CAPACITY TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORK, AND ABILITY TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE STAFF PRESENCE IN REGION IX.
