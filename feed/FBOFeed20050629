<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a sole source purchase order to the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI) to develop and produce a video in DVD format for technology transfer to PCI members.  The precast pavement projects featured in the DVD will be exclusively the demonstration projects resulting from Task 58 of FHWA’s Concrete Pavement Technology Program.  The success of FHWA’s demonstration projects depends upon the awareness and participation of the precast/prestressed concrete industry.  PCI is uniquely qualified to create the needed awareness and gain the support of the precast/prestressed industry for the production of technically sound and economically viable panels for pavement applications.  PCI’s knowledge of the technical capabilities and organizational structure of its member companies makes PCI the uniquely qualified organization to plan and produce a video that will properly inform their industry member within the context of their business interests to gain industry support for paving applications of precast/prestressed concrete.  Because PCI is uniquely qualified to provide the required services this is a sole source requirement.  The anticipated award date is on or about July 13, 2005.

<DESC>The objective of this task is to design and test a VISION prototype.  The working prototype system should be able to analyze pictures and videos from large data sets, individual cases, or the Internet, to reduce forensic examiners processing times in conducting forensic media analysis. 

Defense Cyber Crime Institute (DCCI) is seeking an industry partner/partners that can provide the capabilities required for the processing of digital pictures and/or video.  The Industry Partner(s) that has the capability to perform digital pictures and/or video analysis shall be evaluated for what they are capable of performing and not be automatically eliminated because they can not accomplish all functions in the SOW.

The prototype system, that is to be designed, will work as an independent system architecture during its integration, test, and evaluation phases.  The prototype, once operational, would be incorporated into a legacy system consisting of Windows 2000 servers (soon to be moving to Windows 2003 Servers Enterprise Edition) and Personal Computers running Windows 2000 Workstation operating system.
	
The SOW defines the tasks and managerial requirements of the industry partner to design, integrate, and test a VISION prototype.  The VISION prototype system will consist of the integration of hardware, software packages (COTS), and processes developed to support investigations involving images (digital pictures) and video.  The prototype, 1/16-scale of the eventual system, will be used as a test bed to research and develop new techniques for the eventual operational system.  Prototype testing will determine the best processes from each Software package to be leveraged against the problem set from a repository of data, information from individual cases, or information from the Internet.
	
The industry partner(s) shall also provide support services that encompass recommendations for technical, logistical, and life cycle support for the VISION prototype to the DCCI program office.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Fracture Analysis Model Development. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Structural Reliabilty Technology (SRT), Inc., Boulder, CO, pursant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for acquisition of supplies or services when the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  SRT is the sole developer of the FEA-Crack software program that forms the base infrastructure for this effort.  The Government currently utilizes this software platform for fracture mechanics analysis supporting the flight safety of structures.  It is a unique tool that is proprietary to SRT and that does not exist elsewhere in the marketplace.  The procured software development activity builds directly on this existing architecture, therefore SRT is the only company capable of adding these new capabilities to this code. 2.  Development of the required capabilities by someone other than SRT would require additional time and expense because they could not build on the existing FEA-Crack architecture.  To achieve the required analysis product, any company other than SRT will have to invest heavily in fundamental data handling capabilities for the WARP3D and ABAQUS software analysis packages, which is a duplication of effort already accomplished by SRT. 3.  Development of these analysis tools outside the FEA-Crack package would present significant compatibility issues and hinder efficient workflow within the Damage Tolerance Assessment Branch by requiring a recurring time investment to integrate two separate analysis packages. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 08, 2005.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a FlashCT-DAQ Field Ruggedized Workstation. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from HYTEC Sensors and Imaging Group, Los Alamos, NM, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for acquisition of supplies or services when the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  The proposed FlashCT-DAQ portable workstation is required for the acquisition of radiographic images in a field environment using x-ray detectors already owned by MSFC.  The data acquisition (DAQ) software installed on the workstation is natively compatible with MSFC's detectors and generates data that is compatible with datasets already acquired at MSFC using a HYTEC FlashCT laboratory workstation.	 2.  The proposed portable workstation will be used in ongoing field radiography testing that was started using FlashCT hardware and software.  Datasets generated with the workstation must be in the same vendor-proprietary format as data previously collected.  Other vendors cannot reverse-engineer the HYTEC image format to create a competing product without violating copyright law and licensing agreements between MSFC and HYTEC. 3.  Market research conducted by the requiring activity has revealed that there is no other known source capable of satisfying the Government's requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 8, 2005.

Industrial Economics, Inc. with task order 3W-2502-NBLX, under GSA Schedule GS-10F-0224J is the incumbent contractor.  This requirement is included in  EPA's Forecast Database under record number FY06-248. Small business must have the technical and personnel capability to perform at least 51% of the labor hours as the prime contractor and team members or subcontractors to perform the remaining hours.  They must be able to provide support in the  subject areas. All small businesses with the appropriate technical and personnel capability are invited to submit a Capability Statement.  The Capability Statement must (1) address the contractor's technical and personnel experience as it relates to all subject areas described in the draft  Statement of Work (http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/02423/index.htm), (2) provide examples of relevant technical and personnel experience, and (3) identify the tasks it will achieve using in-house staff and the tasks it will achieve using team members or subcontractors.  The EPA does not  want full-scale proposals.  Please limit responses to ten (10) pages, single-spaced, size 12 font and only provide the information requested in this paragraph.									 Background: EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) is responsible for providing assistance to enforcement  professional from EPA and the States in determining: 1) a violator's economic benefit of noncompliance, 2) the violator's ability to pay for compliance, clean-ups and civil penalties, 3) the value of a supplemental environmental project (SEP).  This assistance is largely provided through five  current computer models: BEN, ABEL, INDIPAY, MUNIPAY and PROJECT. (These are the names of the models and not acronyms.) BEN calculates a violator's economic savings from violating the law.  ABEL, INDIPAY and MUNIPAY evaluate claims of inability to pay from for-profit entities, individuals and  municipalities, respectively.  PROJECT calculates the net-present, after-tax value of a proposed supplemental environmental project. The EPA requires specialized expertise in corporate finance, municipal finance and accounting.  Update of the current models, development of new models, training, and  expert advice on financial issues that impact enforcement litigation are required.   Special Requirements: Free from Organizational Conflicts of Interest; ability to handle enforcement sensitive information and confidential business information. The information contained in the Capability  Statements will be used to determine the qualifications of the small business community with respect to this requirement.  DEPENDING ON THE RESPONSES TO THIS MARKET RESEARCH, THIS REQUIREMENT MAY BE SET-ASIDE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FOR SMALL BUSINESSES OR PROCURED THROUGH FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.   No feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their individual Capability Statement. The Statements should be sent via email to miller.debbie@epa.gov.  The due date for Capability Statements is 4:00PM/EDT July 13, 2005.   Please submit any questions in writing to the  Contracting Officer at miller.debbie@epa.gov.  Answers to any questions concerning this announcement will be posted to the following web address :  http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/02423/index.htm

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and Subpart 13.106 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Request for quotation number RFQ-DC-05-00246 shall be referenced on any quotation. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect thru Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04. STATEMENT OF WORK:  Blind Audit of EPA Protocol Gas Cylinders. BACKGROUND: EPA is responsible for implementing air quality programs that rely on accurate calibration gases.  Under these programs, calibration gases are used to calibrate EPA reference methods which, in turn, are used to perform stack tests or to  calibrate installed pollutant continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMs) that are used by regulated sources to report emissions to EPA.  If the reference methods are low by 20%, then emissions are underreported by 20%.  Calibration gases are also used to ensure that ambient air quality  analyzers provide accurate results.  Accurate calibrations gases are critical in helping to ensure that the Clean Air Act-mandated National Ambient Air Quality Standards and emission reductions are achieved.  Between 1978 and 1996, EPA's Office of Research and Development conducted several  performance audits of calibration gases from various manufacturers.  These audits had two goals, to provide a quality check for gas vendors and to connect users with good gas vendors.  One notable result in the most recent five consecutive years of audits is a steady, significant reduction in  failure rate of the calibration gases, from about 27% in 1992 down to 5% in 1996.  In 2003, EPA's Clean Air Markets Division conducted a "surprise" audit of 14 national specialty gas producers and found that the failure rate had risen to 11%.  Section 2.1.10 of "EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay  and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards" (Protocol Procedures), September 1997 (EPA-600/R-97/121) states that EPA will periodically assess the accuracy of calibration gases and publish the results.  TASKS AND DELIVERABLES: Task #1: The Contractor shall audit EPA Protocol Gas cylinders  and check the cylinders' certificates of analysis for conformance with requirements, according to "EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards"(Protocol Procedures), September 1997 (EPA-600/R-97/121) or equivalent written cylinder analysis protocol.  The  analytical reference standards for the audit shall be National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) primary standards, NIST Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) or NIST-Traceable Reference Materials (NTRMs). The Contractor shall not be responsible for obtaining EPA Protocol gas cylinders  from specialty gas producers as this function will be performed by another organization under contract with EPA.  Task #2: The Contractor shall produce a draft report of the results of the audit of EPA Protocol Gases.  At a minimum, the draft report shall include: (1) a description of the  analytical method, analytical instrumentation, the statistical data analysis techniques, and the analytical reference standards that were used with their compositions, certified concentrations, stamped cylinder numbers and expiration dates; (2) a description of the EPA Protocol Gases that were  audited, including their compositions, original certified concentrations and uncertainties, stamped cylinder numbers and expiration dates; (3) audited cylinder concentrations with calculated uncertainties; (4) percent difference between original certified concentrations and audited cylinder  concentrations; (5) a documentation checklist for each certificate of analysis with any non-conformances identified; (6) the date that the last cylinder was received by the gas metrology laboratory; (7) an Excel spreadsheet or other written documentation showing the calculations that the Contractor  used to convert the instrumentation readings into the audited cylinder concentrations and calculated uncertainties; and (8) if a specialty gas producer elects to re-analyze a cylinder after learning the results of the audit, the final report shall include a comparison of the original cylinder  concentration and the re-analyzed cylinder concentration.  The Contractor shall ensure that the draft report is received by the EPA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) within 30 calendar days of the Contractor receiving the last cylinder.  The Contractor shall submit the draft report in  Microsoft Word and/or Excel files via e-mail according to the Report Distribution List.  Task #3: The Contractor shall produce a final report of the results of the audit of EPA Protocol Gases.  The Contractor shall ensure that the COR receives the final report within 14 calendar days after  receiving comments on the draft report from the COR.  The Contractor shall submit the final report in Microsoft Word and/or Excel files via e-mail according to the Report Distribution List.    Task #4: The Contractor shall ship the EPA protocol Gas cylinders back to the cylinder providers within 14  calendar days of COR acceptance of the final report.  The Contractor will not be paid until the final report is deemed acceptable by the COR.   Report Distribution List: Send via e-mail (1) copy of monthly progress reports, (1) copy of all draft products and (1) copy of all final products to the  Contracting Officer's Technical Representative: John Schakenbach, schakenbach.john@epa.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Range Instrumentation Systems Squadron (RISS), Air Combat Support Systems Group (ACSSG), Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB FL, is seeking information from qualified sources interested in the acquisition described below, which will utilize funds from the DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR CONTRACTORS EMPLOYING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES defined as follows. Eligible contractors are those that are operated on a for-profit or non-profit basis that--(A) employ severely disabled individuals at a rate that averages not less than 33 percent of the company?s total workforce over a period prescribed by the Secretary; (b) pays not less than the minimum wage prescribed pursuant to section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C 206) to the employees who are severely disabled individuals; and (C) provides for its employees health insurance and a retirement plan comparable to those provided for employees by business entities of similar size in its industrial sector or geographic region. A severely disabled individual is an individual with a disability as defined in section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S. C 12102)) who has a severe physical or mental impairment that seriously limits one or more functional capacities. If you believe your company can meet all of the requirements of the contract, and of the Demonstration Program, please e-mail the points of contact below with a notification of interest. Please include self-certification that your company meets the disabled employees standards set forth in the above paragraph. Only those companies that meet the requirements defined will be considered for award. Please do not respond to this request for information if your company does not meet the requirements. The Air Force (USAF) anticipates contracting with a company to build to print a new USAF designed hanger band assembly for Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pods. The new hanger band assembly was designed and developed by the USAF for Department of Defense (DOD) use. The new design will replace the current design ACMI pod hanger band assembly system, which utilizes AIM-9 missile hanger band assemblies and hanger band parts. The current design, which is based on the AIM-9 missile, is now known to be composed of a number of life cycle parts which are expensive to maintain in both time and dollars. The new USAF designed hanger band assembly eliminated the current known issue with the current ACMI pod hanger band system and is designed for automated manufacture. The principle manufacturing processes employed in the manufacture of this design include CNC water jet cutting, CNC turning, CNC milling, and welding of non-ferrous metals. The successful contractor will supply all labor and materials to manufacture the new hanger band assembly in accordance with the technical data package with the possible exception of the two 5/16-24 UNJF bolts used in each assembly per DWG 639AS6699, which are DOD unique. The Government may elect to supply these bolts to the contractor as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), due to the Government?s purchasing power of this DOD unique part. The contractor will propose on the manufacture of approximately 900 hanger band assemblies, including a first article which will be inspected and test fit on an ACMI pod under Government direction before the contractor will be approved for production. The contractor will also be required to propose for additional hanger band assemblies in lots of approximately 100, indicating any price breaks for varying quantities. This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties for submission packages in response to this RFI. The final requirement, if any, would be defined under a formal Request for Proposal. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website located at www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information. Respondents to this Notice will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of information submitted. 
This RFI has been dually posted to Classification Code 99-Miscellaneous

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>A--60,000 BTU/HR Improved Environmental Control Unit (60K IECU) Program Draft Request for Proposal
<SOLNBR>W909MY-05-R-0007
<RESPDATE>021505
<CONTACT>Patricia Davis, 703-325-1713
<DESC>It is the intent of the CECOM Acquisition Center Washington to issue a draft Statement of Work (SOW) and Purchase Description (PD) for industry comment for the 60,000 BTU/HR Improved Environmental Control Unit (60K IECU) program.  The 60K IECU progra m is a joint Army and Air Force effort to replace heavy and inefficient field environmental control units that utilize ozone depleting refrigerants.  The proposed full and open competitive acquisition will result in a single contract award.  The single acq uisition will be executed in three phases:  1) an 18-month Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase, 2) a 6-month Firm-Fixed-Price option for the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Phase, and 3) 9 one-year Fixed  Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity options for the Full Rate Production (FRP) Phase.  During the SDD phase, the selected contractor will be required to design and fabricate 8 prototype 60K IECUs to support Production Qualification Testing, Log istics Demonstration and a field user evaluation. If the LRIP option is exercised, the contractor will be required to deliver 60 LRIP units for First Article Testing.  The FRP phase will occur over a 9 year period and it is anticipated that a maximum of 9, 838 IECUs will be acquired during this phase.  The 60K IECU will be a replacement for the existing Army 54,000-Btu/hr ECU and the Air Force developed 66,000-Btu/hr Field Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU).  The 60K IECU will be much lighter in w eight than these existing military standard ECUs which are currently used to provide environmental control capability to Force Provider, Deployable Medical Systems, Tactical Operations Centers, and other joint services including the Air Force.  The need fo r the lightweight 60K IECU is shared by all services especially the Army and Air Force who are striving to reduce the logistics footprint and increase system deployability.  Present and emerging command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, su rveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems require environmental control to moderate the environmental temperatures in which these systems operate.  The key performance driver and constraint for military systems today and in the future is system weight .  Additionally, the primary shortcoming is that refrigerants for existing military standard (MIL-STD) ECUs use ozone depleting hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), namely HCFC-22.   This ozone depleting chemical has been regulated according to a specific sch edule that prohibits its manufacture after 1 January 2010, and bans its use altogether by 1 January 2020 for servicing of existing equipment.  These phase-out dates occur much earlier in some allied nations where the U.S. Army must continue to operate.  Ad ditionally, existing MIL-STD ECUs are becoming increasingly unreliable due to lifecycle expiration and/or are no longer supportable by Army logistics and training systems.  MIL-STD ECUs and their associated components were designed to operate with ozone de pleting refrigerants and cannot be economically modified to accept environmentally friendly alternatives.  These ECUs in all sizes and configurations will not meet stated domestic legal requirements or international agreements and shall be used until no lo nger repairable and then replaced with the Family of IECUs.  A recent revalidation to the IECU ORD was approved that identified new requirements for 60K Btu/hr and 120K Btu/hr capacity IECU systems. Performance parameters set forth in the ORD include reduc ed power consumption, reduced weight/logistics footprint, increased reliability, compatible with current military shelter systems as drop-in replacement for MIL-SD ECUs including FDECU, elimination of ozone depleting refrigerants and designed to field an d sustainment level maintenance.  It is anticipated that the draft SOW and PD will be issued on the Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP), https://abop.m onmouth.army.mil on or about 15 January 2005.  No hard copies or copies via email will be available.  Responses shall also be submitted via the IBOP.  In order to use the IBOP a vendor must register by completing the following steps:  1) At the IBOP homepa ge select New User Registration under the User Services; 2) click on the Industry Button; 3) Select either the Browse button or the Browse & Post button.  (If you plan on responding to any future solicitations it is best to select Browse & Post Button, o therwise you will have to register again.  A CAGE Code and Duns Number are required); 4) Complete all the required information and then click on the Submit Request button. Once Registered: 1) At the IBOP homepage select CECOM-2005 from the Army Solicit ations, View By Army Contracting Activity drop down menu and click go; 2) Enter your User Name and Password and click OK; 3) Click on All Business Opportunities by Contracting Officer and then click on the folder ICON to the left of Davis, Patricia ; 4) Click on the folder ICON to the left of W909MY-05-R-0007; 5) Once the draft RFP is posted it will be at the line entitled Messages & Documents; 60K BTU IECU Draft RFP.  Click on that title and proceed to the bottom of the page.  The Draft RFP will b e posted as an attachment.  It is also recommended that each offeror join the solicitation specific mailing list under the RFP number W909MY-05-R-0007.  Once registered on the solicitation specific mailing list a vendor will receive email notification of a ny updates relating to the RFP.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),  intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Rutgers University, Dept. of Geography, Piscataway, NJ for services to provide regular and improved updates to the snow cover extent and snow depth products for use in climate monitoring products as required by the National Climatic Data Center, Asheville, NC.  The type of observations used in data set production include NOAA Northern Hemisphere Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow extent product; microwave snow maps of snow extent and depth are to be derived from a multispectral analysis of satellite data employing frequency gradients; station snow depth observations from U. S., Canadian, and when and where possible to obtain, from Eurasian and some Southern Hemisphere nations.  The geographic area to be covered includes the Northern and Southern Hemisphere continents.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Procurement by less than full and open competition is necessary because of the unique method for mapping snow cover from satellites developed by Rutgers University and its expertise regarding snow cover measurements to produce snow cover maps.  The period of performance shall be from August 16, 2005 through August 15, 2006 with an option for two additional one-year periods.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by July 12, 2005.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.  The applicable NAICS is 541990.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has a requirement to conduct Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) of the Telemetry Buoy for the Underwater Communication System (TBUCS).  TBUCS was selected by the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, Advanced Systems and Concepts, Office of the Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics in FY 05 to be included in the FCT program.  This communications buoy is expected to facilitate communication between the Underwater Communication System (UCS) and surface and airborne platforms.  Due to the need to communicate among multi-national platforms, the system must use the Hydro-Acoustic Information Link (HAIL) System to ensure interoperability.  NAVSEA has determined it is in the government's best interest to solicit this effort from Nautronix Maripro, Inc., 15222 Cook Place, Goleta, CA 93117.  This is expected to be a three-year effort.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This project will be issued as a Two-Phase Design-Build procurement. The project is located on an airfieldaccess is controlled and airfield requirement will be in effect.  This project is a Best Value, two-phase design-build solicitation. The detailed project performance requirements for this project will be included in th e Requests for Proposals (RFP) package (phase-two).  The solicitation criteria relies upon industry standards, where allowable, to afford the offeror a degree on design flexibility while meeting certain specific project requirements.  The successful Contra ctor must design and construct complete and useable facilities, as described in the RFP documents.    One solicitation will be issued covering both phases. Phase One is the pre-selection phase (this phase does not include the submission of a price proposal ).  Proposals will be evaluated in Phase One to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase Two and an amendment will be issued to those selected offerors (minimum of three, maximum of five).  Selection of offerors for involvement in Phase Two  will be based on technical approach and performance capability.  Detailed project design requirements will then be added by amendment to the solicitation at the start of Phase Two of the Request for Proposals.  A maximum of five offerors will be invited t o participate in the second phase.  Phase Two proposal ratings alone will be used to determine the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Award of the Design-Build contract will be made to one of the five firms, which, in the judgment of the Contra cting Officer, provides the best combination of design features and cost/price reasonableness.  In making this determination, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are of equal importance.  The Government reserves the right to make award to other than the lowest price offeror, price and other factors considered. PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The project involves replacement of the 300' X 15,000' main base runway at Edwards AFB, CA.  The scope of the work must remain within the Program amount of $103,000,000.  The final scope of work to be provided in Phase Two may include  the following:  (i) a new temporary runway and replacement of the existing runway or (ii) one brand new runway and abandon of the existing runway, or (iii) some combination/variation of items one & two above. REQUIREMENT:  Edwards Air Force Base requires a runway that can safely support a wide range of aircraft test operations, including launch and recovery of prototype aircraft, heavy aircraft operations to include the B-1, B-2, B-52, KC-135, 747, and various forms of failure testing as well as recovery and transport of the NASA Space Shuttle.  Construction of a temporary runway is needed to allow transfer of all flight operations from the existing runway during construction. Missions that require a 15,000 ft r unway include refused take-off testing of heavy aircraft, wet brake testing of heavy aircraft, hot weather operations of specific aircraft such as the T-38, and recovery of the NASA Space Shuttle. CURRENT SITUATION:  The main base runway which supports almost every flight operation at Edwards Air Force Base is nearly 50 years old and is rapidly degrading as a result of alkali-silica reaction (ASR), a reaction between the cement and the aggregate tha t creates cracking, scaling and spalling of the concrete.  Increased sweeper operations and Foreign Object Debris (FOD) walks are necessary to eliminate concrete chunks several inches across that are routinely discovered.  Emergency FOD repairs have forced  runway closures affecting 10 to 15 flights for each closure.  Pavement Conditions Index (PCI) numbers are dropping rapidly, which is indicative of pavements nearing the end of their useful life.   The runway will soon fail functionally and will no longer be safe for aircraft operations.  In early FY03 the runway was evaluated by a tri-service tea m of experts who rated the pavement conditions along with the centerline as MARGINAL, with potions predicted to be UNSATISFACTORY within the next year.  Functional failure of the runway is expected in 2008.  No other runways at Edwards AFB can safely suppo rt the current and projected test operations without significant test mission delays.  Temporary relocation of these missions is not feasible.  However, many of the current and planned test missions can be supported by a new temporary runway. Phase One evaluations may be based on the contractors past performance, to include the design firm; contractors organization; contractors specialized experience on similar type work; contractors capability, to include key personnel qualifications and e xperience; past performance on utilization of Small Business Concerns; preliminary quality control plans and safety program; a narrative addressing the technical approach; and a narrative addressing the process approach.  Phase Two evaluations are anticipa ted to be based on, but may not be limited to, such items as pavement design;  narrative/technical solutions, to include disciplines such as civil, pavement engineering, structural, electrical; to include innovation and efficiency; proposed management plan ; proposed quality control plan for design and construction; a preliminary schedule; and phasing approach.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237310, Highway, Street and Bridge Construction, $28,500,000 average annual gross revenue for the last three (3) fiscal years.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST), proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with NP Photonics for a high power fiber laser  + amplifier system.   NIST is building an apparatus capable of measuring the frequency of two very narrow optical transitions at 578.42 nm.  The NP Photonics Model No. FLSA-1000-3-1030.0286 meets the required specifications for NIST’s research.  The ytterbium-doped fiber lasers deliver narrow linewidth radiation to amplifier systems which retain linewidth characteristics (<3 kHz) and produce 1 Watt at 1030.0286 plus or minus 0.02 nm.  This combination of custom wavelength, narrow linewidth and high power makes the NP Photonics Model uniquely suitable to meet the governments need.  It is the government’s belief that there is no other company capable of providing an instrument to meet the required specifications.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100K).  This notice is for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Anticipated award date is July 19, 2005.  NAICS:  334513.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst is requesting information pertaining to a fluid handling and servicing system that includes portable equipment to service aircraft and equipment to store and dispense various aviation fluids (e.g. MIL-PRF-83282 hydraulic fluid, DOD-L-85734 transmission and MIL-PRF-23699 engine oil) from 55 gallon drums to the portable fluid servicing units.  The basic servicing unit used to dispense all of these fluids directly into aircraft should have the following general features: (a) Reservoir:  Minimum two-gallon capacity, that can be filled by the bulk fluid handling system as well as by one gallon and one quart cans.  Reservoir should protect fluid from dust, humidity, and rain/fog.  Operator shall be able to see if reservoir requires fluid.  (b) Manual Hand Pump: Self-priming pump with minimum flow rate of 0.8 gpm. (c) Filtration: fluid must be filtered by non-bypassable three-micron absolute filter (d) Servicing Hose: minimum length of 7 ft.  (e) Recirculation Port:  Fluid or air trapped in the delivery hose shall be able to be pumped back into the reservoir without opening the reservoir.  (f) Environment:  Unit shall not be able to be stored and operated under the following conditions:  (1) No leakage if unit is tipped over in any direction or turned completely upside down (2) Tilted Surfaces: Can operate without tip over or movement on a surface that is tilted 15 degrees from vertical whether unit is full or empty. (3) Ambient Air Conditions: Can operate from 0 to 100% humidity, temperature extremes of –65 oF to 160 oF, as well as under wind, sand, dust or salt spray laden conditions. (4) Ruggedness: Survive a two-foot drop test and being dragged on non-skid surfaces with no leakage and only superficial damage. 

For certain fluids the following features are required:  (a) Engine Oil:  Pressure gauge (0-100 psig), resettable fluid totalizer (amount of fluid dispensed to an aircraft the nearest ounce), pressure relief to prevent fluid being dispensed from exceeding 75 psi, bleed valve or similar method to reduce system pressure after servicing aircraft.  (b) Transmission oil:  Low delivery pressure for servicing open-air reservoirs, resettable fluid totalizer (amount of fluid dispensed to an aircraft the nearest ounce). (c) Hydraulic Fluid:  Delivery pressure of up to 250 psi.
Ideally as many parts as possible should be interchangeable between units servicing different fluids, but units of different fluid types should be able to be made noticeably different from each other to prevent dispensing the wrong fluid. (e.g. color, markings, shape, fluid specific quick disconnects).  Information is also requested on fluid handling and storage systems that can fill the portable servicing units from 55 gallon drums.   The handling and storage system can either store fluid in the 55 gallon drum that the fluid is delivered in or can be pumped from that drum into a bulk reservoir.   Include in description preventive measures to prevent cross fluid contamination, facility requirements (e.g. low pressure shop air, electricity, size), spill and leak collection, provisions to protect stored oil from dust and humidity in air, and fluid filtration.  Information is requested on larger wheeled servicing units with capacities up to 30 gallons.  Additionally, information is requested on options for non-manual methods that can use pressurized reservoirs, electrical batteries, small refillable liquid carbon dioxide or high pressure nitrogen cylinders or similar power sources to pump fluid in addition to a manual hand pump. Also requested is a provision for the 3000psi hydraulic dispensing unit and the preservative fluid used in the A/V8B engine. It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN 31 May 2005 to Ms. Lori Bishop, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25221B562-1, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, or by electronic mail at:  lori.bishop@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>88 -- Purchase Research Animals
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security,and the U.S. Department of Agriculture,ARS,at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, Orient Point, New York, intends to negotiate solely with Thomas D. Morris Inc., 4001 Millender Mill Rd, Reisterstown, MD for the purchase of 44 head of cattle to be delivered during July 2005.  In FY 2005 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funded the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) through a reimbursable agreement to accelerate development and testing of vaccines and anti-virals against foot-and-mouth disease in livestock. A significant part of this work involves testing combinations of vaccine, adjuvants and anti-virals in cattle.  In order to minimize variability between tests and variation coming from animals, it is important to obtain homogenous animals from reliable suppliers. It is important that these suppliers are located close to the East coast so that stress associated to long transportation times are avoided. All previous vaccine trails have been carried out with animals from this supplier and have yielded consistent and reportable results. The proximity of the supplier to the Plum Island Animal Disease Center minimizes the shipping costs and logistics of ordering and receiving animals at this laboratory.  Most importantly, the animals from Thomas Morris are of a consistent quality in health and vitality, eliminating the common experience of receiving sick or otherwise compromised animals and having to reschedule trials after replacement animals are received.  This notice is neither a request for quotations nor a solicitation of offers.  Based on the requirements for the above system, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority FAR 6.302.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement on a full and open competitive basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No formal solicitation package is available. The Government anticipates award on July 11, 2005.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs in the preparation of responses to this announcement.

The Government needs additional services related to H92222-04-C-0006 that Herrick Laboratories has developed and therefore provides the necessary knowledge and data to perform these services. The Government does not own any data rights and has no drawings to provide another contractor related to the work performed under H92222-04-C-0006. Therefore, only Herrick Technology Laboratories can perform the required services.

<SUBJECT>A -- Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Business Opportunities Day
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research’s Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program will host the 4th day of the R&D Partnership Conference from 0730 -1530 on Friday, 29 July 2005 at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington DC.  The focus of this day will be to provide an overview of each of the FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs) that will be starting in either FY06 or FY07.  The FNC program is focused on efficiently developing and transitioning mature Science & Technology (S&T) products to the Naval acquisition community within a 5 year timeframe.  

The goal of the FNC Business Opportunities Day is to provide a forum for each EC Manager to brief their ECs with the focus on providing the nature and timing of upcoming opportunities for industry involvement in the S&T development of their ECs.  EC Managers will be available either before or after their scheduled briefs for individual discussions with potentially interested parties.

Statement of Work

The Defense Logistics Agency, DLA Training Center, Workforce Development Division, Leadership & Management Development Team, requires Contractor support for the development and delivery of a training course for non-supervisors entitled, “Is Supervision for Me?”

Project Description


A.	Background:
DLA established the Enterprise Leader Development Program (ELDP) in November 2003 based on the principle that everyone can be a leader.  It is a comprehensive program designed around the DLA leadership competency framework and provides avenues of development for leaders at all levels of the organization.  It also promotes competence in DLA’s potential leaders, those who have yet to be placed in leadership roles or supervisory positions, but who will carry the torch into tomorrow.  

There are five tiers to the ELDP, each designed for a particular segment of the DLA employee base as follows:

•	Tier I – Non-supervisory employees and Team Leaders
•	Tier II – New supervisors in their probationary period
•	Tier III – 1st line supervisors with 2-10 years of experience
•	Tier IV – 1st line supervisors with more than 10 years of experience and managers (supervisors of supervisors)
•	Tier V – Supervisors of managers and Senior Executive Service members

B.	Purpose/Objective:

Tier I of the ELDP is intended to guide non-supervisors in developing leadership skills; and, to assist them in determining if a career change to supervision would fit their interests and capabilities.  This course will provide insights as to the rewards and challenges of supervision and introduce students to the DLA Managerial competencies and how those translate into supervisor duties, responsibilities, and qualities.  

This course is not intended to build leadership skills, but to serve as a decision-making vehicle with the goal of determining if a position in supervision would be a good fit.

C.	Course Instructors:

Training will be delivered through one or more instructors who present for all DLA course sessions so as to ensure familiarity with agency climate/culture and facilitate consistency of content/presentation.  Contractor shall make instructor recommendations to the Government, with the Government having final say as to which instructors will teach the course.  In cases of unanticipated emergencies, substitution of instructors may be recommended, with prior advance notice to and final approval by the Government.  Resumes for potential instructors will be submitted to the Government for review along with the Contractor’s proposal.  Contract instructors must be expert facilitators with:

•	Substantial experience as a supervisor or manager, preferably in the DoD
•	Substantial experience working with DoD organizations
•	Experience in teaching leadership principles (communication, teambuilding, group development, conflict management, etc), to establish the link between knowledge and application, and
•	Have instructed a similar course within the past year.

D.	Content Requirements:

Training will be conducted in one (1) day with seven hours of instruction.  Course hours will include a one-hour lunch break and at least three 10-minutes breaks as needed.  Suggested course hours are 8:00-4:30, although the start and end times may vary if pre-arranged based on the needs of the student population.

Topics/Activities for Presentation

•	Foundation skills of supervisory leadership
•	Student self-assessment (provided by Contractor) of competence in supervisory skills mapped to the DLA Managerial Competencies (definitions and Competency Framework provided by DLA)
•	The roles and responsibilities of being a supervisor
•	The rewards and challenges of supervision (current DLA supervisor input will be provided)
•	What current DLA supervisors wish they would have known before becoming a supervisor (current DLA supervisor input will be provided)
•	Examples of realistic supervisor-employee interactions with opportunities for students to test their responses
•	Definition of leadership versus management (provided by DLA)
•	Qualities of good supervisors
•	What subordinates want from a supervisor
•	How a person’s work relationships change when becoming a supervisor
•	Discussion of future supervisory challenges under the National Security Personnel System (NSPS)
•	Planning for competency development using the ELDP Tier I Guide (Guide to be provided)

Travel Costs:  The estimate for travel costs are calculated using GSA recommended lodging and meals (per-diem); other incidental expenses are calculated in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation.  Travel costs will be reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation.

Training Methodology – The students will explore how the Managerial Competencies are applied in the day-to-day supervision of federal civilian employees and military service members.

The final activity will involve the development of an action plan using the ELDP Tier I Guide.

In 1966, the U.S. Border Patrol engaged in a long-term project to install a vase network of video surveillance sites along the Southwestern and Northern borders.  Remote Video Surveillance (RVS) sites were selected to enable the monitoring of areas where Agents could patrol, and in areas where Agents had significant difficulty in patrolling due to terrain features or distance.  The physical space allotted for the communications center is 34’ square.  The RVS Video Display will occupy the center portion of the North wall in the communications center.  This wall is 34 feet wide by 9 feet high.  The bottom of the video display shall be elevated so as to be visible from all workstations.  The current video display is roughly 48” above floor level.

Current staffing is one (1) or two (2) LECAs on each shift.  Projected staffing levels will increase this to as many as four (4) LECAs on each shift.  As in any vital communication or “911” (emergency) center, the dispatch furniture will be used on a 24 hour, 7 day per week basis.  Operators do not have the ability to get up and walk around.  For this reason, ergonomic considerations are paramount.  The work surface and keyboard platform must be sufficiently adjustable to allow an operator the ability to stand and work comfortably.  When sitting, supports or table legs must be positioned so that unrestricted lateral movement is possible.  Overall configuration must provide a minimum of four (4) operator positions, each with an unobstructed forward view of the RVS display wall.  PC monitors shall not be considered an obstruction unless they are too high to see over while sitting.  Delivery will be FOB Destination.  Installation is anticipated by 31 August 2005.  However, due to the uncertainty of the completion date of the communication center, installation of the console will be determined at a later date mutually acceptable to both parties. Color(s) and material(s) samples must be submitted with quote. Technical Point o Contact is Warren Eoff, (360) 332-1526 or warren.eoff@dhs.gov.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
 “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation to increase the likelihood of survival of sea turtles that are captured during the course of commerical tuna fishing operations in Solomon Islands, and to heighten the awareness generally to the increased concern of the depressed state of the sea turtle populations found in the country and the greater Western Pacific fot the period of award of contract to June 30, 2006.

SOLOMON ISLANDS SEA TURTLE CONSERVATION, MANAGEMENT, MITIGATION, AND OUTREACH PROJECT

Objective
The purpose of the project is to increase the likelihood of survival of sea turtles that are captured during the course of commercial tuna fishing operations in Solomon Islands, and to heighten awareness of the depressed state of sea turtle populations found in the country and the greater western Pacific in general. 
The project has three major objectives: 
1.	To expand the activities of the Solomon Island’s Department of Fisheries and Marine Resources (DFMR) fisheries observer program by increasing the capabilities of DFMR staff and observers in recognizing, handling, and reporting interactions between sea turtles and the relevant commercial fisheries in Solomon Islands;
2.	To familiarize commercial fishing operations in Solomon Islands with techniques of handling sea turtles caught incidentally to fishing operations, and provide appropriate equipment and instructions on how to address specific sea turtle interaction with commercial fishing gear.
3.	To integrate the topic of sea turtle interaction with commercial fishing operations into DFMR’s ongoing fisheries management program. This will enable the DFMR and Solomon Islands commercial fisheries to acquire a broader understanding of how to handle sea turtle interactions at sea and to lay the foundation for future fisheries management activities, if required.
Beyond these objectives, it is expected that the project will collect baseline information on sea turtle-fisheries interactions, and enhance cooperation between DFMR and other government agencies or environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) involved in turtle conservation.

Background
The Pacific Islands Regional Office (PIRO) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) has supported projects, via grants and contracts, aimed at lessening the adverse consequences of interactions between sea turtles and commercial tuna fisheries in Pacific Island countries for over two years. These projects have been aimed at staff and institutional capacity building in government agencies of several Pacific Island countries engaged in marine resources management, along with heightening the awareness of sea turtle bycatch issues in the fishing industry. 
The focus of these projects have been to provide Pacific Island government fisheries managers and locally based commercial fishers with a broader understanding of the level and consequences of sea turtle interactions with commercial fisheries in the countries concerned, and to increase the likelihood of survival by sea turtles that are captured incidentally during the course of commercial fishing operations. 

Training of onboard fishery observers in sea turtle release techniques and the use of such observers as a conduit to change attitudes and enhance awareness of sea turtle bycatch issues has been crucial components in each project. Each of the countries participating in these projects to date have an ongoing fisheries observer programs: Federated States of Micronesia (implementation in 2003), Marshall Islands (2003 and 2004), and Papua New Guinea (2004).
Work Elements 
The project consists of 5 tasks and report writings.  It shall entail 30 days of in-country work in Honiara, Solomon Islands. Work shall consist of a minimum of two workshops for observers where they shall be introduced to the subject of bycatch mitigation and shall be trained in appropriate turtle bycatch mitigation techniques and the use of specific mitigation tools. Information shall be provided on the Solomon Islands turtle resource, with particular attention to those species considered most under threat at the present time. 
Task 1 Preparation or compilation of instructional materials.  
The contractor shall:
•	Provide materials for distribution of vessel operators and crew in Japanese, Korean, Bahasa, and English. Creation of information shall include but not be limited to the western Pacific turtle identification, de-hooking, handling in the event of hooking, for tuna longline and purse seine vessels.  
Task 2   Increasing DFMR Staff and Observer Capabilities: 
The contractor shall:
•	Conduct two (2) workshops of three day duration to include training for DFMR fishery observers and industry in the proper handling of sea turtles incidentally hooked or entangled in fishing gear.  During the workshops, a presentation on the importance of reducing turtle interaction from the commercial fishing industry standpoint shall be made. Mitigation devices shall be explained, and instructional materials provided. Videos showing proper mitigation techniques practiced in other longline fisheries shall be shown. 
•	Create a training syllabus for use in the training sessions as well as for use in future training sessions to be conducted by senior DFMR staff, and provide adequate reference documents for use by onboard observers;
•	Provide relevant tools to observers and training for their use on board fishing vessels, focusing on the tuna and shark longline fisheries. 
The focus of activities shall be with those companies based proximal to Honiara, but travel shall also be undertaken to visit purse seiner(s) based in Noro, Solomon Islands.  

Task 3 Integration of the Topic of Sea Turtle Interaction with DFMR’s Ongoing Fishery Management Program
The contractor shall:
•	Review current in-country data collection programs, including purse seine and longline log-sheets and observer data collection forms and the data collection protocols, to determine what, if any, adjustments might be useful for current programs for the purpose of improving turtle related information;  

•	Recommend appropriate protocols and arrangements for the sharing of sea turtle interaction information collected by DFMR with regional fishery management and environmental organizations. 

•	Hold a workshop of at least one day for Honiara-based ENGOs to explain interaction mitigation steps being taken by DFMR and to present information on the subject.

•	Based on the review of the data detailed above, along with any relevant information from regional organizations, provide a report to DFMR detailing the extent of sea turtle interaction with commercial fisheries in Solomon Islands. Compare and contrast these results with the results from like projects or sources of information in other Pacific Island Countries or from regional organizations.
Task 4 Tuna Industry Outreach 
The contractor shall:
•	Hold informational meetings with vessel agents and operators, as their schedule allows to explain the importance of the topic and provide background information on devices and method to mitigate the adverse effects of interactions between sea turtles and commercial fishing in Solomon Islands.
•	Meet with tuna longline vessel operators and explain observer tasks and duties relating to sea turtle interaction, and provide appropriate handling and release instructions.  Emphasize the new role of DFMR observers in utilizing these techniques and assisting vessel captains where necessary;
•	Provide materials in Japanese and Korean for longline vessel captains, and in Bahasa and English for deck bosses or others in positions of authority onboard.
•	Provide the relevant domestic purse seine company regarding interactions in their payao-based (fish aggregation device) fishery. 
Task 5 Other Activities
The contractor shall:
Organize a meeting of relevant DFMR staff with ENGOs, including but not be limited to, The Nature Conservancy, the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the International Waters Program (IWP) based at the South Pacific Regional Environment Program and the Solomon Islands Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) to publicize the DFMR’s activities and intentions with regard to sea turtle data collection, conservation, management and interaction mitigation. A regular channel of communication exists between DFMR and DEC, and this can be expanded by encouraging participation of person(s) responsible to attend the workshops in Honiara to gain familiarity with the subject matter and project objectives.  
An arrangement between DEC and DFMR for information-sharing and input by DFMR into the national turtle tagging database will be encouraged. 

NOAA FISHERIES:

The NOAA Fisheries will facilitate access by the contactor to the appropriate Solomon Islands Ministry of Natural Resources, Department of Fisheries and Natural Resources personnel.  

The NOAA Fisheries will request that a DFMR representative, ideally one from the DFMR Observer Program, accompany the contractor and participate in all industry meetings.
The NOAA Fisheries will provide access to all relevant informational materials developed to date on sea turtle identification, mitigation and handling on longline vessels fishing under domestic authorizations.   

Deliverable(s):
 
&#61626;The final work product shall be a report to the PIRO, indicating if each of the Task(s) were fulfilled and if not, why.   The report will provide copies of all training materials and syllabus developed for the various meetings / workshops detailed above, along with a copy of the report detailed in Task 3.

 The Report.
&#61626; An electronic version (MSWord) draft report shall be submitted to the PIRO for review 240 days after the date of initiation of the contract.  The report will be reviewed by the PIRO and returned with written comments or suggested revisions to the contractor within 14 days.
$___________________
&#61626; The final draft report incorporating the PIRO comments, shall be submitted 20 days thereafter. 
$__________________
&#61626; The final report shall be submitted in both hard copy and electronic form (MSWord).
$__________________  
&#61626; The final report should include such visual aids as are appropriate to illustrate the findings, i.e. maps, figures, tables.
$_________________
&#61626; The final report shall include endnotes referencing the documents consulted. 
$________________

Timetable:
Day 1 Contract  begins
Day 240  Interim Report Due.  
Day 274 Final Report Due.

It is recognized that the planning and coordination of these activities will be challenging given communication with the DFMR – and it is for this reason a 8 month period of time has been provided.

Estimated Projected Start Date: August 1, 2005

<DESC>Amendment 0002 is issued to extend the due date for Proposals, and to answer some additional questions.

The due date for receipt of Proposals is extend to July 19, 2005, at 10:00 a.m. local time.


Questions & Answers:

1. When do you expect to award the contract?
 
Answer:  As soon as possible after proposals are received, reviewed and evaluated.
 
 
2.  Is there a required in-service date that must be met?
 
Answer:  Delivery of the aircraft is in accordance with the deliverable schedule on page 42 of the solicitation, i.e. within 90 days after award.
 
 
3.  We would also like to know if this contract is replacing an existing one.  And if so, what type of aircraft is being replaced?
 
Answer:  The subject solicitation is to replace a Gulfstream I aircraft.
 

4.  How do STEs connect to commercial SATCOM communications?   What types of phone systems are compatible with the government provided STEs?  Does the Magnastar C-2000 referenced in the solicitation meet this requirement or is the government implying that the "STE SATCOM and phone interface" mentioned on page 43 is a different item?  If so, what type of interface is normally used for these connections?
 
Answer:  The Coast Guard has experience with the Magnastar C-2000, an aircraft telephone system which allows use of multiple lines for secure and non-secure communications.  The Government-furnished STE (Secure Terminal Equipment) is an encrypted telephone system, used with a standard RJ-11 or RJ-45 connection and routed through the Magnastar C-2000 or other compatible system.  Depending on how calls are transferred within the aircraft, the STE may require additional shielding and/or 100dB isolation between system channels to successfully complete required communications security (TEMPEST) testing.
 
5. Will the government provide larger ground support equipment not commonly associated with "OEM requirements", such as a tug and de-icing equipment?  

Answer:  Yes

<CONTACT>Charles D. Winslow, 703-695-5029
<DESC>The following questions and answers were submitted by a prospective offeror. 1.      Under OBJECTIVES:  This assessment should include the internal threats of economic stagnation, ethnic dissent, the lack of a sound legal and judicial system,  organized crime, and corruption.  Is the intent for the team to conduct an assessment of the macro-economic situation and status of the judicial system in Kosovo?  There is no requirement to assess these factors in extensive detail but they need to be referred to with some analysis as contributing factors. In practical terms: we would not expect more than a few pages framing these issues in the report, as long as the  analysis provided by the contractor factors these issues in.   2.       Under MILESTONES AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contractor will provide a monthly progress, ... briefing.      The study duration is anticipated to be six months from the date of the award.  This conflicts with: Within four months of contract awar d: The contractor will complete the final report and deliver it to OSD.  What is the duration of the contract?  Sorry this was not fixed! Should be four months across the board. This is probably better for the contractor since the project is small.   3.       How much time (days) will the assessment team spend in Kosovo?  How long are the two in-country trips?   There are no/no specific limits-we would not think they should be longer than a week per trip, possibly shorter
