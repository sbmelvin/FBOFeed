<DESC><br />Solicitation Number: W912WJ-17-R-0003 <br />Restrictions: Unrestricted<br />Title: Mechanical Dredging in the Lower Harbor, New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site, New Bedford, Massachusetts<br />Location: Lower Harbor of New Bedford and Fairhaven, Massachusetts
<p>* Please note that the Presolicitation Notice was posted under W912WJ-16-R-0002 and the new Solicitation number is W912WJ-17-R-0003.<br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is issuing a Request for proposal for a new Firm-Fixed-Price construction dredging contract utilizing a best Value Tradeoff acquisition approach. The project involves the mechanical remediation dredging of PCB contaminated sediments and disposal into a Confined Aquatic Disposal (CAD) Cell.</p>
<p>Work consists of providing materials, equipment and labor for mechanical dredging of approximately 138,000 cubic yards (CY) of material and depositing it in the Lower Harbor Confined Aquatic Disposal Cell (LHCC). The work requires the contractor to achieve precise dredge cuts. Dredging, placement of material into scows, transport of the material, and depositing of material into the LHCC must be performed with minimal spillage or turbidity. All work to be performed under this contract including all dredge areas and the LHCC is located between the Route 195 and Route 6 bridges.</p>
<p>The scope involves dredging in depths of up to 30 feet of water and as shallow as 3 feet. Sediments placed into the LHCC will be dredged using mechanical dredging equipment with an environmental bucket (closed bucket). Debris removal and disposal will be required prior to dredging and may include discarded metal objects, timber, and abandoned piers. Dredging accuracy will be key to minimizing the amount of over-depth dredging while still attaining the required dredge elevation. State-of-the-art monitoring and positioning systems are required to ensure dredge accuracy requirements are met.</p>
<p>The debris removal and dredging shall be performed so that the project-specific turbidity criterion of 50 neptholometric turbidity units (ntu) above background measured 300 feet down-current of the dredge area is not exceeded. The dredged sediments will be placed into split-hull scows for transport to the LHCC. Free-standing water collected in the scows/hoppers shall be decanted and filtered using activated carbon to ensure compliance with this same 50 ntu turbidity criterion. A silt curtain and oil boom shall be placed around the perimeter of the LHCC.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Providence Healthcare System, has a requirement for Engineering design, layout, and support services for research purposes.  A fixed price contract of approximately 5 years is anticipated and shall be awarded. It is the Government s belief that only Bay Computer Associates of Cranston, RI possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement since this new work is a continuation of past efforts.  This notice is advising the public of the Government s intent to issue a sole-source solicitation and award to this vendor.

Inquiries/information received after the established deadline (January 25, 2017) shall not be considered. The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned. The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited. This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. 

Performance Work Statement:

Background:  Developing technologies to assist persons with paralysis, locked-in syndrome and limb amputations is a priority for the Dept. of Veterans Affairs and the Providence VA Center for Neurorestoration and Neurotechnology. ALS, with over 4000 new cases (U.S.) each year, has disproportionately high incidence among the veteran population. Due to injuries sustained in recent conflicts, care for veterans with upper extremity amputation is increasing. The VA has advanced relevant assistive technologies such as direct neural control of communications software for persons with ALS, revolutionary prosthetic arms, and functional electrical stimulation (FES) of paralyzed limbs. While direct brain control could advance adept use of these technologies, current neural decoding platforms are cumbersome and immobile. This
research overcomes this barrier by developing a lightweight, battery-powered mobile platform that receives and decodes neural signals and delivers operating commands to mobile assistive technologies.

The contractor shall work with the VA Principal Investigator and study staff to carry out the services/requirements described below.

Requirements: The purpose and scope of this research contract is for the contractor to provide engineering layout design work yielding custom circuit board design files (such as schematics, board layout and documentation) and successful board fabrication, assembly and testing. The contractor must also provide intensive Engineering design support, through close interaction with the VA Principal Investigator and study staff, in specialized domains including high-performance wireless signal transmission, low-power and high-speed circuit design, medical prosthetic applications and custom embedded systems design. 
Scope of Work: Bay Computer Associates will provide Engineering Design work, Engineering Support and Layout to:
define a microprocessor motherboard for prosthetic applications and its associated electronic sub-parts such as power supply system.
create the custom motherboard including design, schematic, layout and documentation.
determine specifications for, and create, the power supply scheme to power the motherboard.
create custom input/output daughter cards to meet functionality specified by research study staff.
as needed, perform circuit board design and layout revisions.
provide other expert guidance in electronic systems design as needed to achieve project goals as defined by the VA Principal Investigator and research study staff.
We anticipate that the numbers of hours of services will not exceed:
Engineering Design work   450 hours (Estimate)
Engineering Support   450 hours (Estimate)
Layout   450 hours (Estimate)
Period of Performance: Five years from date of award.
Type of Contract:  Indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity.  Task orders will be placed against the contract as engineering design, layout and support hours and materials are needed.
Progress and Compliance: Progress and compliance will be monitored by the Principal Investigator. Findings will be reported to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

Performance under this contract is subject to all VA and VHA regulations and policy without limitation as to those now in effect or as may be established and is subject to oversight of the VA Principal Investigator in consultation with the COR.

The contractor shall submit invoices in a timely manner to the VA Principal Investigator for approval for services provided under this contract before submitting through the VA payment system. All invoices are subject to approval by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). 
The research under which this project is funded may be extended, supplemented or expanded by additional funding from the VA s Office of Research and Development based on congressional appropriations.

The contractor shall initiate the NAC by completing a Standard Form 85P, using the latest version of the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ) program (available for download at Website www.dss.mil). The NAC requires the employee to authorize an "employment," "residence," and "criminal" history records check, and submit to fingerprinting. The Government shall conduct and cover the cost of the actual NAC. Upon favorable adjudication of the records check results, interim unescorted entry may be granted pending completion of NAC. Unescorted entry based on a favorable records check will be limited to Area 7 (main base portion of SAFB).</p>
<p>The contractor shall direct each eligible employee to personally report to their Security Representative who will work with the 50 CES Security Manager for completion of the AF Form 2586 Unescorted Entry Authorization Certificate. Contractor employees will not be allowed unescorted entry to SAFB secured buildings until these procedures have been completed.</p>

The restricted/controlled area badge shall only be valid for the employee's term of employment or for the duration of the contract, whichever is shorter. Upon employee termination, the contractor shall surrender the restricted/controlled area badge to 50 SFS Building 15, Pass and Registration Office, no later than 3:00 p.m. on the following workday.</p>
<p>When inside restricted area, contractor personnel shall, at all times, display restricted/controlled area badges on their outer garments above the waist. Remove and secure the restricted/controlled area badges immediately upon departure from the restricted area to prevent loss. Incidents of a person not properly displaying badges or violating escort procedures (e.g. working out of view of escort) shall be treated as a breach of security and that person shall be susceptible to apprehension, search and detainment. Any person inside a restricted area without a restricted/controlled area badge will be detained or apprehended, searched, removed, and turned over to appropriate authorities for disposition. The contractor shall insure personnel are briefed on base security requirements.</p>
<p>Access to classified information by contractor personnel during performance of this contract is prohibited. However, contractor performance shall be within controlled areas that shall require contractor compliance with various levels of security and require certain established personnel security entry control procedures.</p>
<p>The installation commander reserves the right to deny entry to SAFB to any person whose NAC is unfavorable or upon disclosure of information that indicates the individual's continued entry to SAFB is not in the best interest of the USAF. Additionally, the violation of or deviation from established security procedures by any contractor employee may result in the confiscation of restricted/controlled area badges and denial of future entry to SAFB.</p>
<p>Restricted/Controlled Area badges issued to contractor personnel are subject to recall for inventory and verification purposes. Contractor personnel shall surrender restricted/ controlled area badges to Government personnel conducting such inventory and/or verification immediately upon notification.<br />The contractor shall provide an Employee Access List (EAL) to the Contracting Officer and the 50 CES Security Manager by the second workday of each month or as requested.

The EAL shall be on company stationery and signed by the contractor's Security Officer or an Officer of the Company.</p>
<p>50 SFS personnel will verify the identity and entry authorization of each contractor employee and vehicle, and may conduct a search of any baggage, articles, or vehicles on SAFB.<br />Contractor employees requiring entry, but not requiring unescorted entry, will be issued a visitor badge and will be under direct surveillance at all times by a contractor employee possessing a restricted/controlled area badge with escort authority. Contractor employees entering SAFB will obtain their visitor badge from the 50 SFS, Building 15. The visitor badge will be returned to the entry controller each time the employee departs the SAFB controlled area. While within<br />the SAFB controlled area, contractor personnel will display the visitor badge on their outer garment above the waist and shall remain at all times within view of the escort official. The escort for all contractor personnel shall maintain positive visual contact with escorted employees at all times.</p>
<p><br />The contractor shall immediately report the occurrence of lost badge(s) to the 50 CES Security Manager, who will in turn report to 50 SFS. If the 50 CES Security Manager is not available, the loss shall be reported directly to 50 SFS within one duty day of loss. Replacement badge will not be issued until reporting procedures are satisfactorily completed.</p>
<p>All costs incurred by the contractor associated with security requirements (with exception of the NAC investigations) including submission of necessary security investigation paperwork, routine entry/exit delays, and operational delays due to contingencies or exercises, are to be anticipated by the contractor and shall be included in the price of the contract. Base exercises are estimated to occur approximately 15 workdays per year; however, during contingencies and exercises the contractor's work will normally be rescheduled.</p>
<p>The contractor shall obtain all necessary cards, passes, buttons, decals, or other items required for access to the area or areas in which work will be performed.

<p>PART 3<br />Markings</p>
<p>Section 3B.28 Active Vehicle Barrier (AVB) Envelope Markings</p>
<p>Standard:<br />Active vehicle barriers shall be surrounded with a retroreflective white pavement marking envelope to delineate the hazard area and prohibit standing or parking on the safety loops. The envelope shall consist of 12" wide stripes at a 45 degree angle separated by a 24" clear space. The envelope shall be full lane width and a minimum of 8 feet in length.</p>
<p>Support:<br />The use of the safety envelope is required to reduce the probability of vehicles resting over the AVB, or resting over the safety loop, thereby preventing the barrier from deploying.</p>
<p>Section 3B.29 AVB Markings</p>
<p>Standard:<br />The AVBs shall have retroreflective markings that are in conformance with the MUTCD Section 8C.04. Active Vehicle Barriers shall be fully&#8208;retroreflectorized on both sides with alternating red and white vertical striping (16 inches in width). The minimum height of the vertical stripes shall be 4 inches. The minimum amount of retroreflectorized surface visible to oncoming traffic shall be 1152 square inches. When it is impossible to meet the 1152 square inches of visible surface area due to the AVB design, supplemental in&#8208;road lighting or AVB attached warning lights are required.</p>
<p>Support:<br />AVBs, when deployed, are a form of road closure and are a significant hazard to vehicles. The amount of surface area available for marking with retroreflective material is limited by the varying AVB designs. Therefore the dimensions of the red/white intervals may be modified to fit the AVB design.</p>
<p>Attachment 2</p>
<p>Traffic and Safety Engineering for Better Entry Control Facilities 2014 Force Protection Issues</p>
<p>8.6.3. Active Vehicle Barrier Markings and Delineation AVBs are often improperly delineated. The use of red and white stripes is appropriate because of the stop condition that is required for the impact hazard (AASHTO Roadside Design Guide). Additionally, since these devices are typically centered within the travel way, striping should be oriented vertically. In addition to the front face of barriers, the backside of barriers should be delineated to the extent possible. Delineation should match the same vertical configuration. The markings will maintain retroreflective based on expected traffic for a minimum of two years.</p>

<p>The intent of this Sources Sought is to assess the state-of-the art of the technology available in Flat Wagon Railcar products that could be applied to meet this requirement. The Government envisions a solution for the Flat Wagon Railcar requirement that meets the following operational and program requirements:</p>
<p>The Flat Wagon Railcar shall have six axles for the transport of extremely heavy loads, especially those with small areas of settlement. General characteristics of the Flat Wagon Railcar include the following:</p>
<p>1. Built to German Technical Inspection Association (T&Uuml;V) requirements and International Unions of Railways (UIC) over-sized/over-dimension guidelines for cargo that operates on Standard Gauge rail (1435mm inner rail to inner rail).</p>
<p>2. New, 90 metric tons (MT) capacity, single platform flat wagon railcar with six-axle (three 2-axle trucks) with capability of carrying one M1A2SEPv3 (74 MT) tracked vehicle (with full combat configuration weight of 78.5 MT). Key is that the total weight of the M1A2SEPv3 will increase to 74 MT versus 64 MT.</p>
<p>3. Individual railcar specifications should be approximately 16.4 meters overall length, 15 meters rail car bed length, 3.10 meters railcar bed width, 90 MT maximum load weight, and 31 MT average weight of railcar. <br />a. The current Deutsche Bahn (DB) Cargo single platform heavy-duty flat wagon railcar (Samms) version used to transport the M1A2SEPv2 has a maximum load limit of 89 up to 101 MT. The M1A2SEPv2 brings its entire bearing weight, however, onto a short stretch of the railcar that is only 4580 Millimeters. Therefore, the proposed railcar needs to be designed in such manner that it can hold at a minimum the 78.5 MT on a length of 4580 Millimeters (current Samms cars can only hold max 64 MT on a length of 4580 Millimeters).<br />b. Weight per axle and weight per linear meter shall be under the allowable railway of at least Category C2 railway and the corresponding load limits of the railcar as described in the LOCA explanation guide (available on-line).</p>
<p>4. Deck height above rail at end sills should not exceed 1300 mm nominal.</p>
<p>5. Provisions to reduce the gap distance between cars and support pillars (for roll on/roll off capabilities) to permit the operation of circus-type tracked vehicle loading. This may include a fixed convex/concave deck plate at the car end location or a sliding plate fixture for example.</p>
<p>7. Chain tie-down securement system (four rows of anchor holes per car) in conformance with UIC Open Top Loading Rules and subparts.</p>
<p>8. Deck floor plates should be minimum 0.375 inch thick steel welded to the underframe and in combination with the side-sills shall extend the full width of the railcar.</p>
<p>9. Below deck handholds and safety provisions as required by T&Uuml;V requirements and UIC regulations.</p>
<p>10. Railcars to be equipped with end-of-car cushioning units</p>
<p>11. Below deck hand brake (one per railcar).</p>
<p>12. T&Uuml;V requirement and UIC compliant bottom shelf design couplers with manganese steel coupler carrier wear plates, at least 0.5 inch thick.</p>
<p>13. Railcars to be sandblast prepped, primed and painted with appropriate stencils per UIC and reporting marks.<br />1. Requested information to provide on Flat Wagon Railcar design and engineering:</p>

PRELIMINARIES 25% DESIGN REVIEW
Preliminary drawings for construction projects are a means of identifying alternative approaches to correcting physical and functional deficiencies. The development of these drawings is an interactive process between VA staff and the Engineering Firm in order to produce a narrative and graphical description of possible program alternatives. As appropriate, the VA will make available prior to contract negotiations a tentative priority list of functional areas which may be included in the project, and a statement task.
Prior to beginning any design work, a preliminary meeting will be conducted between the A/E Firm and VA staff. At this stage, the scope of work will be finalized and agreed to by all VA services involved in this project. At this point the A/E Firm will have surveyed the existing facility to verify all existing conditions and become familiar with all deficiencies that need to be corrected. The A/E will write minutes of the meeting to the Contracting Officer for distribution and approval by the appropriate staff.
The Engineering Firm in collaboration with VA staff, will illustrate in sketch form various possible program alternatives and refine them based on continuing interaction with the VA project team. The A/E Firm will then complete and present alternative solutions which are functionally and architecturally viable for consideration.  The VA will select the final concept and subsequently identify the approved scope to be developed in the second preliminary (100%) review stage.
The VA considers originality and imaginative design an essential part of the A/E Firm's responsibility. The total environmental approach is a necessity to all planning. Site, structures, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, open and screened areas and their relationships to each other should be combined to produce a plan that is functional and aesthetically pleasing.  
Complete conceptual alternatives must be displayed on the preliminary drawings.  The work may include the division of an alternative into distinct parts, each of which has an identified priority.  The preliminary drawings must, therefore, be developed so that irrespective of which parts (in priority order) are selected for further development in the Working Drawing phase, the solution shall provide a well-designed facility with respect to functional operation, construction phasing, minimized disruption of existing hospital operation, and compatibility with structure and utilities between (1) existing facilities; (2) those for imminent construction; and, (3) those with low priority for future construction.
A narrative to accompany the drawings shall identify construction phasing which will be necessary to permit continuous operation of critical hospital operations.  In addition, areas of new construction and renovation shall be shown.  A detailed listing of submission requirements for phasing is included in a later paragraph.
Subsequent to each VA review of the Engineering Firm's work, The A/E Firm shall incorporate VA recommendations into the Preliminary Drawings.
Review meetings will be conducted at the end of each design phase.  Submit five (5) copies of all narratives, drawings, calculations and cost estimates to be reviewed by VA staff.  The cost estimates will reflect the level of completeness at each review stage.  In addition, the A/E Firm shall take minutes of the review meeting and submit two copies to the Contracting Officer for distribution to VA staff.
The first review shall include the following:
Drawings shall be completed to the review percentage.
Demolition work required for each area.

<CONTACT>Sherrie A. Blackmon, Phone 7704882925, Email kuj1@cdc.gov
<DESC>Title of Project: Public Health Support Services for ATSDR Public Health Assessment Activities<br />Introduction: This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541690 with a size standard of $15M dollars.<br />Background. This procurement is entitled "Public Health Support Services for ATSDR Public Health Assessment Activities". The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) was created under Sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended by Section 110 (P.L. 99-499) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). ATSDR was created to implement the health-related sections of CERCLA as amended by SARA.<br />Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of this indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)contract is to facilitate the procurement of regularly and repeatedly scientific, technical, expert, and logistical services (e.g. outreach and education services) for ATSDR in support of its public health mission with regards to public health assessment activities such as, but not limited to, public health assessments, public health consultations, exposure investigations, biomonitoring activities, health studies, training, and related outreach, education, and evaluation activities. <br />ATSDR public health assessments, health consultations, and other Agency activities are mechanisms to respond to community and public health concerns associated with human exposure to hazardous and/or industrial substances at sites and projects. Public health assessments, health consultations, and other ATSDR activities evaluate and oftentimes collect relevant environmental and biological data, health outcome data, and community and public concerns associated with a site where hazardous and/or industrial substances have been released. The public health assessment process identifies populations living or working on or near hazardous waste and/or industrial release sites and determines which public health actions are warranted, such as, but not limited to, public health assessments and consultations, exposure investigations and biomonitoring activities, emergency response, technical assists, health studies, public participation and education, and chemical-specific studies and evaluations. ATSDR, where warranted, may evaluate current, past, and/or future exposure to hazardous waste and/or industrial substances to communities living near hazardous waste/industrial release sites. <br />The community associated with a site can be broadly defined as the population(s) living around the site/project and all others who can provide or disseminate relevant information on that site/project during the public health assessment process. The involved community may include individual residents living near the site or organized community/public groups and their representatives. Contacting populations living around the site and interacting with community-based organizations allows for awareness of community/public health concerns and for obtaining other relevant site information. <br />Scope of Work. The unique nature, scope, and complexity of the scientific, technical, expert, operational, and logistical services needed to support ATSDR's public health assessment activities will vary from site to site and project to project. Some public health assessment activities may be completed within 12 months whereas other public health assessment activities may require several years to complete. Project/site support may include, but not be limited to, the following activities: data gathering, evaluation, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination, environmental and biological sampling and monitoring and evaluation, data quality control and assurance, analysis, consultation, report preparation, training, and general and public logistical coordination. <br />Areas of expertise needed to supplement existing agency efforts are classified in the "Statement of Work" as "Expert and Scientific Assistance" and "Technical Assistance" and may include, but not be limited to, such diverse skills and expertise in the following areas: demographics, computer programming for public health assessment purposes, instructional design/technology, graphic design/artistry, statistics, mathematics, environmental and biological modeling, geographic information systems technology, medicine, physiology, engineering (chemical, environmental, industrial, process, mechanical), ecology, geology, hydro-geology, chemistry, health physics, biology, epidemiology, toxicology, environmental science, laboratory science, veterinary science, environmental and biological sampling/monitoring, biomonitoring, meteorology, economics, nutrition, soil science, health education, health risk communication, training, research, program evaluation and decision making, public relations, writing and editing, case study development, distance learning applications, web-delivered health assessment training, conference planning, and administration and clerical.<br />Often, in response to unpredicted events or public concerns, project/site priorities may change. These unpredicted changes, along with existing and planned projects, lead to fluctuating requirements for expert, scientific, technical, operational and logistical consultant services. Because the timing and level of effort cannot be entirely predicted, the work plan, skills, expertise, and deliverables required of the Contractor may fluctuate during the year and from year to year. Emergency and other unforeseen events may also require additional Contractor support. Therefore, the ATSDR Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), with the CDC/ATSDR Contracting Officer's (CO) approval, may add projects and sites to work requests throughout the year and from year to year. In addition, the COR, with CO approval, may modify targets, deliverables, work requests, and funding distributions, depending on the availability of site/project information and priorities of ATSDR.<br />Technical Requirements. Within the two general areas of support, the Contractor may be required to perform the types of tasks listed below. Performance of all areas of support and tasks may be required concurrently on multiple projects, sites, and tasks. Contractor personnel may be required travel to accomplish project/site activities. Although the successful Contractor will be expected to provide all services ultimately listed in the SOW, it is not expected that the successful Contractor(s) will have the capabilities to perform all of the required services included in the scope of work for this acquisition. Therefore, the Government anticipates that subcontracting for some limited services (e.g. laboratory services, expert panel members, highly specialized expertise) may be necessary.
<p>A. Expert and Scientific Assistance<br />ATSDR requires expert and scientific assistance in its mission to prevent exposure and adverse human health effects and diminished quality of life associated with exposure to hazardous substances from waste sites, industrial releases, unplanned releases, and other sources of pollution present in the environment. Examples of such assistance include, but are not limited to, the evaluation of data and information on the release of hazardous/industrial substances into the environment to assess any past, current, or future impact on public health, and identify actions needed to evaluate and mitigate or prevent human health effects. Contractor required expert and scientific assistance shall be, but not limited to, advice, consultation, development, evaluation, analysis, reporting, and interpretation of environmental public health issues using scientific knowledge, methodology, principles, and practices approved by ATSDR.</p>

<DESC>THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT, HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: NAS Engineering

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), NAS Engineering Group (AJW-14), Oklahoma City, OK has a follow on requirement to provide second-level engineering support services that directly affects the safety of the flying public.  This group is primarily based in Oklahoma City, OK at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) and the National Weather Services Radar Operation Center (ROC) in Norman, OK.   

This requirement includes, however not limited to, the acquisition for a wide variety of appropriately skilled engineering, technical, and administration support personnel to perform hardware and software engineering services involved in the acquisition, restoration, maintenance, and modification of ground-based NAS equipment throughout the United States and overseas.  Services shall be required to perform tasks in support of power, navigational aids, communications, surveillance, weather systems and applicable administrative functions as further defined in the Statement of Work (Attached) with minimal assistance from FAA personnel.  

The Government seeks to award a single, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract that includes a mix of Time and Material/Labor Hour (T&M/LH); Firm Fixed Priced (FFP); and Cost Reimbursable line items.  The contracts period of performance to include base and all option periods is a 9-month base ordering period with six (6) one-year option periods.  This contract will also incorporate a 30-day transition period prior to the start of the base contract period.  Options will be priced and evaluated for award purposes as a part of the offeror's proposal in accordance with AMS 3.2.4-31 (April 1996).

This acquisition is set-aside exclusively for competitive award among nation-wide Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB)/8(a) that are expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBAs 8(a) program.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Justification for Sole Source</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The Inner Space Center (ISC) is an international leader in ocean science research, exploration, and education. Located at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography, the ISC captures, displays, and disseminates high bandwidth streams of undersea video and data in real time, expanding the capacity for ocean scientists to engage in mission operations. It uses cutting-edge technology, including telepresence, to explore the global ocean, support research, and engage diverse audiences. The Inner Space Center brings the excitement of ocean discoveries to onshore audiences worldwide and inspires the next generation of ocean explorers. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Currently the Inner Space Center provides the video infrastructure for telepresence technology for the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research. Telepresence connects users from all over the world in near real time to ocean expeditions in remote areas of the world. The Inner Space Center also supports various other ships with this technology and is expanding to their service to the UNOLS fleet. Since the Inner Space Center already houses the necessary infrastructure and also recognized as a leader for Ocean Video Products they are the only known contractor that has the in-house expertise and experience working with current NOAA OER video products. Because the Inner Space Center maintains the current NOAA OER video production infrastructure and their unique expertise they are the only known contractor that can develop this interface software. </span></p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a shapeable radiation shield made from fiber metal laminates. The technology was developed based on a need for better performing shielding of sensitive spacecraft electronics. Beyond spacecraft electronics, the invention has uses for radiation protective clothing, radioactive fluid piping shields, nuclear reactor shields, and other applications. This technology is a flexible, lighter weight radiation shield made from hybrid carbon/metal fabric and based on the Z-grading method of layering metal materials of differing atomic numbers to provide radiation protection for protons, electrons, and xrays. To create this material, a high density metal is plasma spray-coated to carbon fiber. Another metal with less density is then plasma spray-coated, followed by another, and so on, until the material with the appropriate shielding properties is formed. Resins can be added to the material to provide structural adhesion, reducing the need for mechanical bonding. This material is amenable to molding and could be used to build custom radiation shielding to protect cabling and electronics in situations where traditional metal shielding is difficult to place. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent Pending.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov</a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.&nbsp; Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company.&nbsp; Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <a href="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These responses are provided to members of NASA Langley&rsquo;s Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development &ldquo;OSACB&rdquo; for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.&nbsp; <strong>No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.</strong></p>

<DESC><p>USSOCOM continues to foster a culture that embraces and supports innovation in our research, development, and acquisition programs to meet the demanding needs of the Special Operator. To support USSOCOM's continued emphasis on innovation, SOF AT&amp;L has established a venue called SOFWERX; an unclassified, open collaboration activity designed to bring non-traditional partners from industry, academia, and the government together to work on USSOCOM's most challenging problems.</p>
<p>USSOCOM is using a diverse combination of recruiting strategies to provide the baseline technical workforce at SOFWERX, including employees of the Doolittle Institute non-profit organization, government and university interns, and most recently industry fellows provided and supported by interested industry partners.</p>
<p>USSOCOM has vacancies for three - six energetic technical experts from industry to be Exchange Fellows in the SOFWERX innovation environment. Ability to work in a dynamic environment is a must.</p>
<p>Desired Industry Fellowship qualifications:<br />1. Software Programmer - Coding<br />2. Senior Software Programmer - Algorithms<br />3. Electrical Engineer - Control Theory<br />4. Aerospace Engineer<br />5. Robotics Engineer<br />6. Systems Engineer<br />7. Software Programmer - Mobile Developer (Android etc)</p>
<p>Resume: Interested parties should submit a resume, five pages maximum, to IndustryFellow@socom.mil.</p>
<p>The Government will rate candidates against the following selection criteria:<br />- Minimum of seven years of engineering experience;<br />- Current active practicing engineer;<br />- Strength and diversity of resume; <br />- Track record of interest and experience in innovative or "maker" positions; and<br />- American citizen or a permanent resident alien.</p>
<p>The three to six most highly rated candidates will be invited to participate in this program.</p>
<p>Schedule: All resumes must be submitted no later than 21 Feb 2017.</p>
<p>Agreement: Details of the Industry Fellow relationship will be documented in an Individual Work Plan (IWP) under an existing SOCOM Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). If no such CRADA exists, one will be agreed to prior to building the IWP. An example IWP is attached.</p>
<p>Length of Fellowship: The term of each fellowship will be agreed on in the IWP. In general, they will be no less than three months and no more than one year. But, they may be extended in three-month increments for a total of not more than one year with agreement of both parties.</p>
<p>Terms and conditions: The private sector organization providing the Industry Fellow will have full responsibility for payment of all salary, allowances, and any benefits (i.e. medical care, worker's compensation) to their participating employee(s), including any travel and/or relocation expenses if the individual participant selected is outside of the local Tampa area.</p>

Background:  
The Cleveland VAMC will be replacing its current podiatric x-ray unit at the Wade Park and Parma facilities. Currently these x-ray services are only offered at our Wade Park and Parma facilities, but the Cleveland VAMC will be adding these services at the Akron, Canton, Mansfield and Youngstown Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). This unit, CR plate reader, is utilized in the performance of Weight Bearing Feet and Ankle exams. The current Podiatry units at Wade Park and Parma are an older Computer Radiography (CR) system. These current units are beyond useful life and are no longer being supported by the manufacturer. The move to Direct Radiography (DR) is the newest technology that provides better quality imaging and simultaneously will reduce the dose of radiation to each patient significantly. This lower radiation dose is a most important benefit to our Veteran patients and DR is the gold standard in imaging technology worldwide. 
Specifications:  
Unit SHALL include a computer, x-ray tube, stand, hardware, software and DR Plate
SHALL be a floor unit
SHALL use DR Technology
SHALL be covered by no less than a 2 year warranty
SHALL be DICOM conformant
SHALL be ADA Compliant Ortho-base
SHALL include education/training
SHALL require no more than 10 seconds for image acquisition 
EVALUATION CRITERIA/ SUBMISSION OF OFFER
All Questions Shall be submitted in writing in response to the Solicitation and are due no later than Monday 23 January 2017 at 3:00 PM EST. Questions shall be emailed to christopher.callihan@va.gov on or before the date and time stated. Any Government responses, answers, and or/comments to all questions will be posted by 24 January 2017. 
Contractor is responsible for verifying all existing field conditions.  Contractor assumes the responsibility of surveying the existing conditions as part of their performance.

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>Anticipated award date is on or about 29 June 2017.<br /><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />&nbsp;<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br /></strong>&nbsp;<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br /><strong>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.</strong> Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br /><strong>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.</strong> Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br /><br /><strong>Election of Forum.</strong> After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br /><strong><br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</strong></p>

<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>

Technical tradeoff will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose quote conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representation and certifications, and other information required by this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of requirements, contract terms and conditions, or an unrealistically high or low price when compared to Government estimates, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the program. Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all quotes. Only those quotes determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the quotes will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price and technical acceptability. Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced quote meeting the acceptability standards for the non-priced factors. TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARD: The contractor shall address the following two factors: 1. Factor 1  Technical Capability  Offeror shall clearly demonstrate its approach to technical ability to meet the requirements of CLIN/Line Items based on meeting the requirements of the Request for Quote, quantity, quality and timeliness of delivery. 2. Factor 2  Price  The offeror shall complete CLIN pricing. In addition to the completed CLIN pricing, the offeror shall provide sufficient price information to allow the contracting officer to determine the completeness and reasonableness of the offerors prices. DISCUSSIONS: If during the evaluation period it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, Offeror responses to clarifications/discussion notices will be considered in making the source selection decision.<BR><BR>The award decisions will be made as follows: (1) Step One  Determine Technical Acceptability. The technical evaluation, Factor 1, stated above, will assess the offerors capability to satisfy the Governments requirement. The Government will evaluate all technical capability quotes received by the required date/time. The Technical Capability factor will receive a rating of acceptable and unacceptable. If any factor is rated unacceptable, the entire quote is rendered technically unacceptable, and the quote will be removed from the competitive range. Only quotes deemed technically acceptable (either initially or as the result of discussions) will be considered for award. The ratings are defined in the following table. Rating Description Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Only those quotes determined acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussion will be considered for award. Once deemed acceptable, all technical quotes are considered to be equal. Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Quotes with an unacceptable rating will not be considered for award. Table A-1 (2) Step Two  Evaluate Price. The offerors Price quote will be evaluated, for award purposes, based upon the total price proposed as annotated under Factor 2  Price. (3) Step Three  Award Decision. Award will be made the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror, subject to a positive responsibility determination in accordance with FAR Part 9 and conformance of the offerors quote to the terms and conditions of the solicitation. DISCLAIMER: This is a request for the submission of a quote and does not constitute a contract or authorization to begin work. Nor does an offerors submission of a quote constitute a contract or authorize the individual or company to being work.<BR><BR>

proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command
Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA
22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at:

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (DOC/NOAA/NESDIS), intends to award a Purchase Order pursuant to Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the authority of FAR Pat 13.    This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format at FAR Subpart 12.6., as supplemented with additional information included in this notice, and it being conducted pursuant to FAR 2005-95 dated January 13, 2017 Part Subpart 12.6 and FAR Part 13. The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is EE133E-17-RQ-00144  The requirement is a total small buisness set-aside. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541712 &ndash; Size Standard 1,000 employees.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  1.	Background The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) have RF Spectrum Management responsibilities. NOAA satellites have multiple missions, and involve GSO and Non-GSO satellite systems, with a broad range of environmental earth sensing. Such information provides meteorological data in real-time to Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps tactical ground weapon stations and navy ships worldwide.  NOAA data collection relies on radio frequency (RF) downlinks from satellites and instruments commanded by NESDIS.   NESDIS further supports the NOAA mission with telemetry, tracking, and command of the NOAA satellite constellations via spectrum dependent links.  NESDIS also operates the Polar Operational Environmental Satellite (POES), the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), and the Ocean Surface Topography Mission (OSTM/JASON-2/3), and many other satellite networks.  All data collected from the satellites/missions and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is used to provide timely and critical environmental information to other Government Agency operations.    The GOES R series satellites, scheduled to launch in FY2016, will be comprised of improved spacecraft and instrument technologies, which will result in more timely and accurate information.    The National Broadband Plan requires NOAA, and other Government agencies, to potentially share existing heavily used Government spectrums with commercial broadband.  This will present a challenge to NESDIS Program Offices in terms of RF spectrum access and resources, requiring a high level of strategic planning and participation in spectrum regulatory bodies (i.e. International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL).  2	Objective Under this spectrum support task, the subcontractor will support a broad range of RF Spectrum technical, engineering, analytical/empirical, and management functions pertaining to the responsibilities inherent in Department of Commerce/NOAA/NESDIS.  The primary task areas are spectrum engineering, Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S), and technical and spectrum management analysis. 3.	Tasks 3.1	Primary Responsibilities At a minimum, the following support tasks are required: ITU-R and Domestic Regulatory Support The following is the ITU-R support:  1.

1. To insert Minimum Wage Guidance: 

Attachment 1:  Contract Clause
 
MINIMUM WAGES UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 13658 (JANUARY 2015)
 
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause
 
United States means the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
 
Worker
 
(1) Means any person engaged in performing work on, or in connection with, a contract covered by Executive Order 13658, and
 
(i) Whose wages under such contract are governed by the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. chapter 8), the Service Contract Labor Standards statute (41 U.S.C. chapter 67), or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute (40 U.S.C. chapter 31, subchapter IV),
 
(ii) Other than individuals employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as those terms are defined in 29 CFR part 541,
 
(iii) Regardless of the contractual relationship alleged to exist between the individual and the employer.
 
(2) Includes workers performing on, or in connection with, the contract whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(c).
 
(3) Also includes any person working on, or in connection with, the contract and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship or training program registered with the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office of Apprenticeship.
 
(b) Executive Order Minimum Wage rate. (1) The Contractor shall pay to workers, while performing in the United States, and performing on, or in connection with, this contract, a minimum hourly wage rate of $10.10 per hour beginning January 1, 2015.
 
(2) The Contractor shall adjust the minimum wage paid, if necessary, beginning January 1, 2016 and annually thereafter, to meet the Secretary of Labor's annual E.O. minimum wage. The Administrator of the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (the Administrator) will publish annual determinations in the Federal Register no later than 90 days before the effective date of the new E.O. minimum wage rate. The Administrator will also publish the applicable E.O. minimum wage on www.wdol.gov (or any successor Web site) and on all wage determinations issued under the Service Contract Labor Standards statute or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute. The applicable published E.O. minimum wage is incorporated by reference into this contract.
 
(3)(i) The Contractor may request a price adjustment only after the effective date of the new annual E.O. minimum wage determination. Prices will be adjusted only if labor costs increase as a result of an increase in the annual E.O. minimum wage, and for associated labor costs and relevant subcontract costs. Associated labor costs shall include increases or decreases that result from changes in social security and unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but will not otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.
 
(ii) Subcontractors may be entitled to adjustments due to the new minimum wage, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2). Contractors shall consider any subcontractor requests for such price adjustment.
 
(iii) The Contracting Officer will not adjust the contract price under this clause for any costs other than those identified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause, and will not provideduplicate price adjustments with any price adjustment under clauses implementing the Service Contract Labor Standards statute or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute.
 
(4) The Contractor warrants that the prices in this contract do not include allowance for any contingency to cover increased costs for which adjustment is provided under this clause.
 
(5) A pay period under this clause may not be longer than semi-monthly, but may be shorter to comply with any applicable law or other requirement under this contract establishing a shorter pay period. Workers shall be paid no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which such wages were earned or accrued.
 
(6) The Contractor shall pay, unconditionally to each worker, all wages due free and clear without subsequent rebate or kickback. The Contractor may make deductions that reduce a worker's wages below the E.O. minimum wage rate only if done in accordance with 29 CFR 10.23, Deductions.
 
(7) The Contractor shall not discharge any part of its minimum wage obligation under this clause by furnishing fringe benefits or, with respect to workers whose wages are governed by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the cash equivalent thereof.
 
(8) Nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from compliance with any applicable Federal or State prevailing wage law or any applicable law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the E.O. minimum wage. However, wage increases under such other laws or municipal ordinances are not subject to price adjustment under this subpart.
 
(9) The Contractor shall pay the E.O. minimum wage rate whenever it is higher than any applicable collective bargaining agreement(s) wage rate.
 
(10) The Contractor shall follow the policies and procedures in 29 CFR 10.24(b) and 10.28 for treatment of workers engaged in an occupation in which they customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips.
 
(c)(1) This clause applies to workers as defined in paragraph (a). As provided in that definition
 
(i) Workers are covered regardless of the contractual relationship alleged to exist between the contractor or subcontractor and the worker;
 
(ii) Workers with disabilities whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(c) are covered; and
 
(iii) Workers who are registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program or training program registered with the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office of Apprenticeship, are covered.
 
(2) This clause does not apply to
 
(i) Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)-covered individuals performing in connection with contracts covered by the E.O., i.e. those individuals who perform duties necessary to the performance of the contract, but who are not directly engaged in performing the specific work called for by the contract, and who spend less than 20 percent of their hours worked in a particular workweek performing in connection with such contracts;
 
(ii) Individuals exempted from the minimum wage requirements of the FLSA under 29 U.S.C. 213(a) and 214(a) and (b), unless otherwise covered by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute. These individuals include but are not limited to
 
(A) Learners, apprentices, or messengers whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(a).
 
(B) Students whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(b).
(C) Those employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity (29 U.S.C. 213(a)(1) and 29 CFR part 541).
 
(d) Notice. The Contractor shall notify all workers performing work on, or in connection with, this contract of the applicable E.O. minimum wage rate under this clause. With respect to workers covered by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, the Contractor may meet this requirement by posting, in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite, the applicable wage determination under those statutes. With respect to workers whose wages are governed by the FLSA, the Contractor shall post notice, utilizing the poster provided by the Administrator, which can be obtained at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts, in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Contractors that customarily post notices to workers electronically may post the notice electronically provided the electronic posting is displayed prominently on any Web site that is maintained by the contractor, whether external or internal, and customarily used for notices to workers about terms and conditions of employment.
 
(e) Payroll Records. (1) The Contractor shall make and maintain records, for three years after completion of the work, containing the following information for each worker:
 
(i) Name, address, and social security number;
 
(ii) The worker's occupation(s) or classification(s);
 
(iii) The rate or rates of wages paid;
 
(iv) The number of daily and weekly hours worked by each worker;
 
(v) Any deductions made; and
 
(vi) Total wages paid.
 
(2) The Contractor shall make records pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this clause available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Administrator. The Contractor shall also make such records available upon request of the Contracting Officer.
 
(3) The Contractor shall make a copy of the contract available, as applicable, for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Administrator.
 
(4) Failure to comply with this paragraph (e) shall be a violation of 29 CFR 10.26 and this contract. Upon direction of the Administrator or upon the Contracting Officer's own action, payment shall be withheld until such time as the noncompliance is corrected.
 
(5) Nothing in this clause limits or otherwise modifies the Contractor's payroll and recordkeeping obligations, if any, under the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, the Fair Labor Standards Act, or any other applicable law.
 
(f) Access. The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Administrator to conduct investigations, including interviewing workers at the worksite during normal working hours.
 
(g) Withholding. The Contracting Officer, upon his or her own action or upon written request of the Administrator, will withhold funds or cause funds to be withheld, from the Contractor under this or any other Federal contract with the same Contractor, sufficient to pay workers the full amount of wages required by this clause.

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:

(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or
(2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.

AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity.

The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.

Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010]<BR><BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.<BR><BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Ronald Kabat Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-9630 Email: Ronald.l.kabat.civ@mail.mil<BR><BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement.<BR><BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>CORRECTION TO INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: THIS IS FOR THE ASHVILLE VAMC ONLY


The Department of Veterans Affairs Mid Atlantic Health Care (VISN 6) intends
to negotiate sole source procurement for the Ashville VAMC to PICIS for a PICIS Clinical Information System(CIS). This system is needed to acquire  a single clinical record system spanning the pre-operative, intraoperative, intraoperative, post-operative, ICU and stepdown units. This system has to work seamlessly. System must allow all physiological parameters crossing over electronically (no flat files) from pre-op, intraoperative, post-operative, ICU, step-down and back if required  with the already installed PICIS Anesthesia Record Keeping System (ARK). The Veterans Affairs has determined that this procurement should be issued as a sole source because of only (1) capable source able to fulfill the requirements of this contract. 

This proposed procurement is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501(a)
The NAICS code is 541511 and has a size standard 500 employees for this
Procurement. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES; however, any company that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification prior to the response due date and time. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirement. 

Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, Leah Trossen, via leah.trossen@va.gov
Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the award. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.  

Due Date for responses 1/24/2017 @ 11am

In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.<br /><br />Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".<br /><br />The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  Offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.<br /><br />Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During the Open Period, offerors will be permitted to submit new offers or modify existing offers.

Please be sure to review FY17 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: W912WJ-16-R-0002 <br />Restrictions: Unrestricted<br />Title: Mechanical Dredging in the Lower Harbor, New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site, New Bedford, Massachusetts<br />Location: Lower Harbor of New Bedford and Fairhaven, Massachusetts<br />Issue Date: on or about March 25th, 2016<br />Closing Date: on or about April 28th, 2016<br />Project Magnitude: More than $10,000,000.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be issuing a Request-for-Proposal for a new Firm-Fixed-Price construction dredging contract utilizing a best Value Tradeoff acquisition approach. The project involves the mechanical remediation dredging of PCB contaminated sediments and disposal into a Confined Aquatic Disposal (CAD) Cell.</p>
<p>Work consists of providing materials, equipment and labor for mechanical dredging of approximately 120,000 cubic yards (CY) of material and depositing it in the Lower Harbor Confined Aquatic Disposal Cell (LHCC). The work requires the contractor to achieve precise dredge cuts. Dredging, placement of material into scows, transport of the material, and depositing of material into the LHCC must be performed with minimal spillage or turbidity. All work to be performed under this contract including all dredge areas and the LHCC is located between the Route 195 and Route 6 bridges.</p>
<p>The scope involves dredging in depths of up to 30 feet of water and as shallow as 3 feet. Sediments placed into the LHCC will be dredged using mechanical dredging equipment with an environmental bucket (closed bucket). Debris removal and disposal will be required prior to dredging and may include discarded metal objects, timber, and abandoned piers. Dredging accuracy will be key to minimizing the amount of over-depth dredging while still attaining the required dredge elevation. State-of-the-art monitoring and positioning systems are required to ensure dredge accuracy requirements are met.</p>
<p>The debris removal and dredging shall be performed so that the project-specific turbidity criterion of 50 neptholometric turbidity units (ntu) above background measured 300 feet down-current of the dredge area is not exceeded. The dredged sediments will be placed into split-hull scows for transport to the LHCC. Free-standing water collected in the scows/hoppers shall be decanted and filtered using activated carbon to ensure compliance with this same 50 ntu turbidity criterion. A silt curtain and oil boom shall be placed around the perimeter of the LHCC.</p>
<p>Please note this solicitation is an Unrestricted Request-for-Proposal for a new Firm-Fixed-Price construction dredging contract utilizing a best Value Tradeoff acquisition approach, under the applicable NAICS code 237990. This is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about March 25th, 2016. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at Robert.C.Garrahan@usace.army.mil</p>
