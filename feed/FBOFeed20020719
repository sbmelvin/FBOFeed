<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN)-San Diego intends to negotiate a Cost Reimbursement, sole source contract with the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) for the research, development, design, and analysis of Photonic Integrated Circuit to support Optical Domain Tunable Microwave Filtering for Multifunction Antennas. UCSD's unique design for a planar photonic integrated circuit that functions as a microwave filter is based upon a novel optical technique.  UCSD?s expertise in both microwave photonics and semiconductor processing provides a unique capability to quickly achieve prototype evaluation results, which is a major requirement of this contract.  The Government has determined that this procurement is not available for competition because of the substantial duplication of cost, not recoverable through full and open competition, should it be necessary for another contractor to become familiar with the technologies developed.  As a result, it is estimated that unacceptable delays would result while another contractor developed the specialized knowledge and skills required.  This contract's period of performance is for a base period of one year and two, one-year options with an estimated cost of less than $200,000. See government-wide numbered Note 22.

UCSB?s knowledge base of the performance of wavelength conversion techniques in digital telecommunications systems is unparalleled.

SINCE THE DRAWING IS NOT YET FULLY DEFINED, IT IS BY DEFINITION NOT AVAILABLE FOR COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION. PROCUREMENT OF THIS ITEM IS RESTRICTED TO ROCKLAND MANUFACTURING UNTIL THE APM CONSIDERS THE DESIGN STABLE. ALL OTHER SOURCES WOULD REQUIRE EXTENSIVE PRE-QUALIFICATION TESTS, WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN DEFINED.  GIVEN THE SIZE AND CRITICAL NATURE OF THE APRON, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT A FFORD THE POTENTIAL OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISK OF PROCURING FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AT THIS TIME.  THE ITEM IS CRITICAL TO THE OPERATION OF THE M9 ACE. THE APRON FOR THE M9 ACE IS AN EXTENSIVE COMPONENT OF THE END ITEM, COMPRISING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE ENTIRE FRONT OF THE VECHICLE. BEING A CRITICAL ITEM, IT IS NECESSARY THAT A SUPPLIER BE QUALIFI ED PRIOR TO BEING AWARDED A CONTRACT TO ASSURE THERE WILL NOT BE AN ADVERSE SITUATION WITH QUALITY OR DELIVERY. THE APPROVED SOURCE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS DEVELOPED AND SUBMITTED A PROTOTYPE STEEL APRON. IT IS NOTED THAT ROCKLAND WAS SELECTED TO DEVELOP THE STEEL APRON BECAUSE THEY SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED AND ARE PRODUCING THE STEEL BLADE (WHICH MATES WITH THE APRON). ROCKLAND WAS SELECTED TO DEVELOP THE STEEL BLADE THROUGH A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. ROCKLAND HAS SUCCESSFULLY PASSED PRE-QUALIFICATION TESTING A ND DURABILITY TESTING. HOWEVER, SINCE ROCKLAND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DESIGN, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT PROCURE FROM A SOURCE OTHER THAN ROCKLAND UNTIL THE DESIGN IS CONSIDERED STABLE AND A DRAWING PACKAGE REFLECTING THIS DESIGN IS APPROVED.  UPON DELIVERY OF THE TECHNICAL DATA FROM ROCKLAND, REVIEW OF DRAWINGS, ACCUMULATION OF SUFFICIENT FIELD USE TO VERIFY THE DESIGN, AND INCORPORATION OF ANY REQUIRED DESIGN CHANGES INTO THE DRAWING PACKAGE, THE NEXT PROCUREMENT WILL BE COMPETED.

The  EPA is currently using identical equipment and any change in equipment at this time would jeopardize reproducibility and consistency of experiments.  EPA believes that URG is the only source capable of providing the required item because URG is the sole manufacturer and distributor of VAPS.  FAR  6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" permits other than full and open competition.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (Request for Quotations) is available.  All  interested parties who believe they can provide the required item may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability for consideration by the agency within 15 days of this notice to: U.S. EPA, Attn: Barbara Nelson (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle  Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic requests will be honored.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy this requirement.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that  competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine that competition is feasible, a purchase order will be placed with URG.

A Cost Plus Award Fee contract is anticipated for the majority of the effort.  The facility clearance and safeguarding is TOP SECRET.  The contractor will require access to militarily critical technology data which is controlled under the Export Control Act.  Foreign owned/foreign controlled firms and foreign nationals are precluded as a prime contractor for this effort.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from the offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate serious concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to address concerns during the proposal development phase of the acquisition.  Potential offerors should use established channels to request information, pose questions, and voice concerns before contacting the Ombudsman, Mr. Barry Richardson, 703/695-6632.  Potential subcontractors may contact Boeing directly via Mr. James Sanford at 206/655-3786.  For contracting issues contact Mrs. Mary K. Jackson, Chief of Contracts, at 505/846-2928, Maj Agustin Velez, Deputy Chief of Contracts, at 505/853-1121, or Mr Otis Shaw, Contract Specialist, at 505/846-8940.

The SEM must provide a wide range of discreet accelerating voltages and a differentially evacuated sample chamber equipped with a backscattered electron detector (BEI).  The microscope must have an automatic pressure control with manual override. The operator must be able to quickly switch the sample chamber from the differentially evacuated (low pressure) mode to a high vacuum SEM mode where imaging may use either a secondary electron detector (SEI) or the BEI.  Other required attributes are: (1) Resolution of at least 3.0nm at high accelerating voltage in the SEI mode and 4.0nm by BEI in the differentially pumped mode.  In the high vacuum mode, it must be possible to attain a resolution of 12nm at 1kV at 8mm WD and 3.5nm at 25kV at the analytical working distance. The analytical WD shall be no greater than 10mm and must provide a take-off-angle of at least 35 degrees for EDS analysis. (2) Magnification range from less than 5X to 300kX in at least 130 steps, or continuously. (3) Accelerating voltage adjustable from 300V to 30kV in at least 55 discreet steps-- 100V increments from 300V to at least 3kV. (4) EDS system must meet or surpass the EDAX PhoenixPro Genesis energy dispersive spectrometer including a sapphire detector with digital signal processing, X-ray mapping and digital imaging for the SEM. (PV8306/60 system). Imaging resolution must be at least 8K by 6K.  Shall have a mathing and have a flat panel display to that of the SEM.  The detector must cool down and be operational within one hour from ambient temperature.  System shall be provided with a sinle keyboard/mouse mode of operation for the SEM-EDS. (5) Sample chamber accommodates samples as large as 12 inches in diameter and 3 inches high weighing up to 3 kg.  Eucentric tilt stage maintains focus, mag and field of view at all WD positions.  Stage travel sufficient to observe a 7 inches diameter sample when combining rotation with X-Y translation (e.g.X=125mm,Y=100mm).  Other travel at least 80mm in Z, -10 to 90 degrees of tilt, 360-degree rotation.  Motorized, computer controlled mouse, or joystick, drives travel for all axes  (X,Y,Z,T,R). Stage speed shall be proportional to, and linked to, magnification.  Graphical display of sample stage, showing position of beam on sample and relative position of sample to final lens.  Store and recall at least 2000 stored stage coordinates with the operating conditions (e.g., mag, focus, astigmatism, vacuum mode) and automatically position stage to the intersection of cross hairs set by the operator on the display, or to any point in the X, Y, Z, T, R plane either individually or simultaneously.   Able to tilt an 8 inches sample up to 45 degrees at a WD as short as 10mm and up to 60 degrees at 20mm.  Minimum take-off-angle of 35 degrees, for an EDS detector, with the sample surface perpendicular to the incident beam at a WD of 10mm or less.  Sample tilt in the direction of the EDS detector to provide maximum count rates for irregularly shaped samples.  The sample stage shall be internal, separate from the SEM door, allowing users to place any given sample directly on the stage, observing its proximity to all detectors prior to closing the door for evacuation. (6) Electron optics with a cartridge-type wehnelt assembly, auto filament saturation, and auto gun alignment-automatic or manual. Electromagnetic beam blanking at operator discretion.   Two-stage zoom Condenser Lens (CL) to permit changes in probe current, and/or kV, without the need to change focus, spot position or stigmation.  Externally selectable and adjustable Objective Lens (OL) aperture.At least three different aperture diameters to optimize image resolution, depth of focus, and maintain the optimum spot size as the beam current is varied.  Capability to add an automated Faraday cup in the column just below the objective lens aperture to accurately measure the true probe current. Dynamic focus capability, linked to mag and WD, for sample tilts of up to 85 degrees. Auto and manual control for focus and OL stigmation.  A wobbler to facilitate optimum centering of OL aperture.  A sharply conical OL, permitting high tilt of large diameter samples at a short WD.   A selection of at least six fixed magnifications that can be instantly utilized from any point in the mag range. (7) Conventional E-T type secondary electron detector, a low vacuum secondary electron detector and a solid state BEI mounted to not restrict any of the sample movement specified above. BEI must permit separation of signal to show pure compositional or topographical image. The ratio of compo to topo signal must be electronically variable. Detector shall allow variable shadow-contrast to enhance topographical features. Location of the BEI must not hinder high resolution SE imaging or limit EDS or any other imaging mode. (8) Vacuum system with a turbomolecular pump rated at least 250 liters/sec, air cooled, and two rotary pumps (RP) rated for at least 100 liters/min.  The turbomolecular pump shall be dedicated to evacuation of the SEM in the high vacuum mode of operation and one rotoary pump must be dedicated to the sample chamber for operation in the differentially pumped low vacuum mode. The second rotory pump to improve overall pump down speed.  The first rotory pump is fitted with a coaxial foreline trap that is bakeable using an operator-controlled timer.  The differential pumping aperture for the column shall be totally separated from the OL aperture so as to allow fine adjustment during low vacuum operation.  Fully automated sequencing.  Minimum vacuum allowed in LV mode no less than 1Pa from the RP.  Water is not required for system. (9) Operating system has keypad, mouse and joystick, with menu selection by either mouse or keypad; mouse control of focus, mag, astigmatism, image shift and stage; and graphical user interface.  Storage and recall of unlimited sets of SEM operating conditions from memory to include all column and sample illumination parameters (e.g., kV, bias, mag, CL and OL setting, stigmator coils) and stage positions for at least 10 users operating the SEM intermittently.  On-screen operator manipulation of the digital image by:  contrast and brightness adjustment; tone reversal; gamma control; psuedo-color display; frame averaging; and pixel integration. Capability to make precise point to point measurements on the displayed digital image.  Hard copy output via digital color printer, a Windows-compatible printer; network printers.   PC disk drive for images stored as BMP or TIFF files.  Automatic control of all major functions, including gun saturation and setting of bias, gun shift and tilt, optimum brightness and contrast after a condition change or moving the sample, focus correction, astigmatism correction, magnification correction for changes in kV and WD.

<DESC>Scope of Work Traditional Use Study Joshua Tree National Park The National Park Service (NPS) is contracting the work specified below for the purpose of entering into a professional services firm fixed price contract for the documentation of 'rock art' (petroglyphs/pictographs) sites associated with traditional use of Joshua Tree National Park (JOTR) by American Indians.   The park has a need to determine whether contemporary tribal heritage experts retain specialized knowledge about 'rock art' in general and JOTR's in particular.  NPS believes it needs to understand general or specific concerns about 'rock art' in its cultural resource management and visitor programs.  Previous actions taken by JOTR to better understand and comply with directives regarding tribal cultural interests and issues include NAGPRA repatriation, an ethnobotany study, and Phase 1 of an ethnographic overview; this study will continue with a portion of Phase 2 of the overview.   'Rock art' is a tangible connection, which the park considers a specific type of archeological resource, between past Native American peoples and contemporary communities who may live many miles away today.  The park lacks understanding about how those communities view this type of cultural resource.  This study is to provide basic information about this specific heritage from the Native American viewpoint, which will enable management decisions or options to be supported with reliable information. Specifically, the areas of interest covered by this solicitation are the following: (1) Historic and present day use of the 127 known 'rock art' sites by local Native Americans within the boundaries of JOTR; (2) Uses of 'rock art' sites in JOTR that may affect, or be affected by, NPS management actions; (3) Tribal consultation regarding the appropriate type of interpretation and content of prospective interpretive materials regarding 'rock art' and 'rock art' sites. This traditional use study emphasizes the collection of ethnographic information regarding specific archeological resources at JOTR.  Some places may be candidates for a Traditional Cultural Property (TCP) Study if both archeological and ethnographic values would support a TCP as a National Register property consideration.  Some data collection focusing on the distribution of 'rock art' styles and possible traditional associations may be necessary to document the use and/or importance of specific culturally significant resources occurring within JOTR.  Research into Native American creation stories and other legends that may tie into the 'rock art' elements will be an essential part of this study.  'Rock art' may be affiliated with trails, tribal boundaries, water sources, solstice or equinox events, or areas with spiritual meaning. Research questions should address these areas of inquiry.  It is the purpose of the solicited research to obtain information about how the Cahuilla, Serrano, Chemehuevi, and Mojave consider 'rock art' sites (or particular design elements) within JOTR environments, to categorize culturally significant 'rock art' sites, and to solicit input on the appropriate level of interpretation of these sites.  Sites categorized as archeological for preservation purposes, for example, contain ethnographic information if traditional religious practitioners consider them to be significant sources of spiritual.  Members of traditionally associated groups may place meanings to localities and landscapes containing 'rock art' where reference points are based on collective notions of past or present use. Traditional land use study data will help managers to better assess the effects of NPS operations on "traditional" native ways of life for culturally affiliated peoples.  Among other applications the information will help managers evaluate requests for access to resources as well as identify park resources that may require special treatment or protection. Background Joshua Tree National Park was established as a monument in the national park system by presidential proclamation No. 2193 on August 10, 1936 (50 Stat. 1760) under authority of the Antiquities Act of 1906.  Its enabling legislation states that the park's "lands contain historic and prehistoric structures and have situated thereon various objects of historic and scientific interest".  With passage of the Desert Protection Act of 1994, the national monument became a national park and acquired jurisdiction of an additional 234,000 acres of land formerly administered by the Bureau of Land Management.  This increased the acreage of the park from 560,000 to 794,000 acres. The traditional use study is one of the first studies programmed when park resources are known or thought to be traditionally associated with a contemporary ethnic group or groups.  The first part of this study will review and evaluate existing archeological and ethnographic data that will serve as a background to design research questions relative to NPS management needs.  The literature review will be focused upon existing examples of Native American reference to 'rock art', assumed to be prehistoric or early historic, within southern California/western Arizona tribal cultures.  A research plan will arise from what tribal cultural references to 'rock art' state, or from the absence of statements.  Basic questions or working hypotheses will be developed in the research plan from this focused review. The second phase of the study will begin ethnographic interviews with knowledgeable individuals of Cahuilla, Serrano, Chemehuevi, and Mojave descent.  It is expected that about 5 substantive interviews will be conducted.  Interviews will be conducted with individuals who have knowledge of creation stories, legends, genealogy, oral or folk history, place names and associated stories, plant and animal resources, religious practices, and other past or present use of the park.  The Principal Investigator (PI) will need to engage knowledgeable persons from the various Cahuilla, Serrano, Chemehuevi, and Mojave cultural communities who are recognized as heritage experts suitable for this study.  The PI may need to make arrangements for these persons to visit Park headquarters to discuss and share their recommendations.  The PI will be expected to pay all expenses for travel to the park. The PI may use information about park 'rock art' already in the public domain when talking with these persons elsewhere (e.g., David Whitley's Davis Dam and Indian Canyon rock art book).  It may develop that some tribal communities won't have much information except in very general ways regarding the 'rock art' we see today.  This is important to document also.  The third phase will be the synthesis of study results and presentation in a report format understandable to the lay person.  This report will summarize the literature consulted, interviews with tribal community representatives, questions and observations from site visits, and shall make recommendations for enhance stewardship by the NPS for these cultural resources (see Deliverables section).   The NPS places primary emphasis on fieldwork and the collection of contemporary ethnographic data in this traditional use study.  Primary emphasis is also placed on Native American input into appropriate levels of interpretation of 'rock art' and/or 'rock art' sties.  Secondary emphasis is placed on the collection and analysis of existing ethnohistorical materials documenting 'rock art', legends, trails, tribal boundaries, water sources, etc., by American Indian communities.  The focus in these studies is on specific cultural groups such as the Cahuilla, Serrano, Chemehuevi, and Mojave, who have both long-term and presently active associations with park resources. Objectives of the Traditional Use Study This project will document the degree, extent, and character of historic and contemporary use of park resources by recording narratives relating to the socio-cultural links between the Cahuilla, Serrano, Chemehuevi, and Mojave and the 'rock art' within park boundaries.  Topics to be documented include, but are not limited to: creation stories and other legends, tribal boundaries, traditional travel routes, place names, possible solstice or equinox sites, ceremonial sites, and religious activities.  The contractor will collect, and through the report present, information related to past and present knowledge regarding the symbolism represented by the pictographs and petroglyphs.  The NPS specifically desires information from contemporary Native Americans that could help guide appropriate interpretation of these important resources to the public.   The NPS acknowledges that the sensitivity of some ethnographic information about culturally significant resources, especially those associated with traditional religious practices, may not be possible or desirable to record.  In these cases, however, an attempt should be made to provide information on the general importance of localities or areas and their character or nature (e.g. religious, ceremonial, etc.) such that culturally informed NPS planning and management decisions can result.  Moreover, the traditional use study is intended to facilitate the development of relationships with knowledgeable tribal members and park-associated tribes and to help the park in developing appropriate interpretation of 'rock art'. Statement of Work The study described herein is to be performed in accordance with the Scope of Work and under the authority and requirements of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-341); the Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as amended (P.L. 96-95); the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (P.L. 96-515); Executive Order 13007; Release No. 5 of the Cultural Resource Management Guideline (NPS-28) and its supplements; Director's Order 28; and NPS Management Policies, 2001, Section 5, pp. 54-57.   The study will employ a principal investigator (PI) that possesses a doctorate degree in ethnography and who has considerable experience in this field of study.  This researcher must be able to demonstrate that they have a long-term relationship established with the tribes in question.  The PI must also be able to demonstrate that they have conducted ethnographic work in the geographical area of the park.  Researchers with comparable experience may be utilized under the PI's supervision.  The contractor will: (1) Conduct a focused literature review/evaluation and prepare a research plan to guide fieldwork and the phases of the study.  The research plan will include the types of interview  questions to be asked of knowledgeable individuals of Cahuilla, Serrano, Chemehuevi, and Mojave descent. (2) Collaborate with the park Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) and appropriate NPS professionals. (3) Attempt to work directly with the Cahuilla, Serrano, Chemehuevi, and Mojave tribes headquartered in California and Arizona.  Along with qualified NPS personnel, the contractor will present the project to interested tribal representatives and, if necessary, adapt the research in accordance with suggestions from tribal staff and members in consultation with, and as approved by, the NPS. (4) Record narratives about traditional use of 'rock art' sites.  The recording should be videotaped if possible or, as a second choice an audio recording made.  If the interviewee does not feel comfortable with these methods written notes can be taken.  The exact number of interviews is to be determined through communication between the contractor and the NPS though it is expected that a minimum of 5 substantive interviews will take place.  "Knowledgeable individuals" will include persons of Cahuilla, Serrano, Chemehuevi, and Mojave descent who are resident in California or Arizona and are recognized as heritage experts suitable for this study.  (5) Record information regarding Native American perspectives on appropriate level of interpretation of 'rock art' and 'rock art' sites.    (6) Review the ethnographic literature, other possible studies similar to that which is currently proposed, archeological records of park 'rock art' sites, existing photographs, maps, and locally available archival sources for information about traditional use utilizing standard ethnohistorical techniques.  In analyzing these sources, the contractor will consider, and discuss in writing, the limitations or biases of important manuscript, photographic, cartographic and published sources.   (7) As an appendix to the report, the contractor will provide copies of interview notes of interview sessions that contain information about relationships and ties to Joshua Tree National Park 'rock art' sites.  This material should attempt to show how places were traditionally recognized, maintained and used, and the relative significance of each site; traditional narratives which evoke Joshua Tree National Park through (i) legends and resultant linkages with belief and ritual, and (ii) historical narratives of recent or contemporary use.   Products (Deliverables) The contractor will produce a research plan and professional quality "typed" report in Microsoft Word 7.0 that addresses elements in the Statement of Work given above. The report will follow the American Anthropologist style, the guidelines for which are available through the publication's web page.  This report will also document the concepts, procedures, and the logic behind findings that lead to the Principal Investigator's conclusions. The final report will be paginated and include: (1) an executive summary, consisting of one to two pages that summarizes the contents of the report; (2) a table of contents, which includes the location of narrative sections, figures, maps, illustrations, and appendices; (3) an introductory section which explains why the study was undertaken, who was involved, and special issues which were addressed; (4) a summary of the literature review; (5) a description of the study objectives and how the methods employed work to obtain those objectives; (6) a non-technical summary and interpretation of the report, which is understandable to tribal members, park staff, and the general public who have little or no expertise in the field of anthropology.  Among the findings, the contractor will: 	(a) identify existing or potential conflicts between cultural group use(s)/traditional practices and current NPS management of these resources.  In addition to this inventory, the contractor will recommend mitigation measures for these conflicts; 	(b) identify data gaps which will indicate the need for additional research in the future; 	(c) assess how information gathered during this study can most effectively be used to augment existing park interpretation programs that best meet the need of the visitor. This will include discussions of what park interpreters need to know in order to accurately and sensitively convey information to the public regarding the traditional use of resources found in the park; 	(d) discuss what park law enforcement personnel need to know regarding traditional use, and how to apply existing law and regulations in ways that are sensitive to the activities of Indian people; (7) a complete bibliography of sources used, including interviews (whether videotapes or audio taped or not) with knowledgeable individuals; (8) an index which lists place names, resource types, and specific categories of information; A draft report will be submitted for NPS review according to the schedule given in Section VII.  It will include Section V components (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) described previously as products (deliverables).  The final report will include all components listed in Section V and be a camera-ready, double-spaced, professional document.  Authors will not copyright the report (see attached waiver) and research materials are to be in the public domain unless administratively restricted by the contracting officer for reasons of privacy or sensitivity.  At the conclusion of the project the contractor will provide the following: (i) five (5) unbound copies with high quality reproduction (clear, sharp, photocopies are acceptable) of any illustrations; (ii) five (5) copies of the report in Microsoft Word 7.0 on a compact disk; (iii) one (1) copy of photographic prints and negatives, maps, or illustrations, used in the report as a separate submittal; (iv) one original of videotapes, audio tapes, and field notes.   Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon, the contractor will submit "release forms" signed by the interviewee(s) for each interview.  Originals of study-related nonsensitive data will also be given to the parks when the draft report is submitted for review.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>DESC: The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Prevention, (DCP) Chemoprevention Agent Development Research Group (CADRG) is interested in conducting animal cancer model studies of biomarkers and intermediate endpoints that might be used in human clinical trials in  order to examine in detail the biomarker modulating effects of selected chemopreventive compounds. In addition the studies will improve biomarker sensitivity, specificity, assay methodology, and sample handling. The emphasis will be on efficient studies aimed at providing more quantitative, and more validated intermediate endpoints for future human clinical trials.  Intermediate endpoints or biomarkers that are directly associated with the evolution of neoplasia, and that develop with much higher frequency in abnormal cells of susceptible individuals than do the actual tumors, will make it possible in the future to carry out many studies on fewer subjects for shorter durations.  If such biomarkers were found to be modified by a particular intervention regimen in preclinical studies, a rationale would be provided for carrying out clinical studies. The application of biological markers to clinical cancer prevention trials carries great promise in relation to ultimate cancer prevention.  When neoplasia itself is used as an end point in studies of this type, a very large number of subjects tested for long durations are often required.  The results of these in vivo experiments will be used to select promising intermediate endpoints for Phase II human studies whose objectives are to study the modulation of a selected biomarker in response to a chemopreventive agent. These relevant preclinical studies will be used to help achieve one of the major goals of the chemoprevention program which is the timely evaluation of chemopreventive agents in clinical trials. A number of chemical compounds and/or dietary components have been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in animal models, in vitro systems, and to be associated with cancer reduction in epidemiological studies. Results from animal studies suggest that a number of compounds and/or dietary components may affect several stages of carcinogenesis. A variety of excellent biomarkers are now available. Examples include reversal of abnormal cytology, ornithine decarboxylase activity, prostaglandin synthetase inhibition, DNA ploidy alterations, changes in cellular proliferation (e.g., tritiated thymidine or BrdU labeling indices, decreases in PCNA or Ki-67 antigens, or histology), and oncogene suppression tests.  The development and utilization of sensitive and accurate intermediate endpoints should enhance the ability to design effective human Phase II clinical trials. This RFP will involve eight (8) workstatements (Nos. 71-78).  Certain study design characteristics apply to the specific Workstatements under this RFP. Most of the requirements for the Workstatement study design will be detailed in the specific workstatement. Each workstatement will have a specific period of performance. The workstatements are: Workstatement #71-Use Of Survivin In Preclinical Studies: Characterization Of Survivin In Various Animal Models And Development Of A Transgenic Mouse Model Overexpressing Survivin;  Workstatement # 72- Intermediate Surrogate Biomarker Studies in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Respiratory Tract  Using Optical Photospectroscopy Analysis; Workstatement #73-Use Of FHIT In Preclinical Studies: Characterization Of FHIT Expression In Various Animal Models And Determination Whether Methylation Of The FHIT Gene Is The Cause Of Altered Expression; Workstatement #74-Effects of Treatment with Putative Chemopreventive Agents on Intermediate Endpoints of Disease Progression in a Transgenic Animal Model of Intestinal Cancer: Study of Tcf4 Activation in ApcMin Mice; Workstatement #75- Effects of Chemopreventive Agents on Tobacco Smoke-induced Mutagenesis in the lacZ Transgenic Mouse;Workstatement #76-Preclinical Evaluation of Intermediate Endpoints and Their Modulation by
Tobacco Smoke in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Esophageal Cancer; Workstatement #77- Evaluation of Ovarian Cancer Chemopreventive Agents in Chickens; Workstatement #78- Effects of topically applied chemopreventive agents and diet in SKH-1 mice:  A chemoprevention model for basal cell carcinoma.

It is anticipated that this RFP will be available electronically on or before August 15, 2002 to all Master Agreement  Holders (MAH). In order to be considered for award, all offerors shall be a Holder and a member of the Preclinical Evaluation of Intermediate Endpoints and the Modulation by Chemopreventive Agents pool as of the release date of this RFP.  All questions should be directed, via facsimile or e-mail to Jacqueline Ballard, Contracting Officer, Prevention and Control Population Sciences Contracts Section, Research Contracts Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Executive Plaza South, Room 6000, 6120 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7195 Rockville, Md. 20852.

<DESC>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a Definitional Mission (DM) to analyze areas of potential TDA support in South Africa (Zambia, Tanzania, and Namibia).  In Zambia, there are four major airports located throughout the country that serve Zambia.  The airports are Lusaka, Ndola, Mfuwe, and Livingstone.  In Tanzania, the Tanzania Airports Authority (TAA) proposes the construction of an international airport in the district of Bukoba.  In Namibia, the Namibia Airports Company Limited (NACLN) is requesting TDA assistance to facilitate the development of a new twenty (20) year investment master plan for upgrading their two international airports.

 The Contractor will be required to travel to Zambia, Tanzania, and Namibia to review the proposed projects.   The Contractor must be qualified to evaluate the economic, financial and technical viability of the proposed projects. Specifically, the Contractor shall provide expert analysis on: potential risks of the proposed projects; the finance ability of the projects and likely sources of financing; potential exports of U.S. equipment and services that could be utilized in project implementation; and priority of the proposed projects to the host country. The Contractor shall provide a report to TDA that includes a thorough analysis of the foregoing issues and a recommendation on whether TDA should fund feasibility studies on these projects. If the recommendation is to fund the feasibility studies, the Contractor shall also develop sound budgets and Terms of Reference (TOR) for the recommended feasibility studies. 

The estimated cost for this work does not exceed $40,000.00.

TDA, located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, promotes American private sector participation in developing and middle income countries, with special emphasis on economic sectors that represent significant U.S. export potential. Through the funding of feasibility studies, orientation visits, specialized training grants, business workshops, and various forms of technical assistance, we help U.S. businesses compete for infrastructure projects in emerging markets.  We assist in building mutually beneficial partnerships between American companies and overseas project sponsors, which result in increased U.S. exports and jobs, and the completion of high quality, successful projects in host countries.  

The Small Business Act, at 15, U.S.C. 252, authorizes procuring agencies to aside procurements or portions of procurements for the exclusive participation of Small Businesses Concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 541330.

Definition: ?Small business concerns? for purposes of TDA award of this total set aside contract means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operating for which it is bidding.  In determining whether dominance exists for TDA?s purpose for this contract, consideration is given to annual gross receipts.  Any concern that is annual gross receipts above $5 million dollars, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

All participating organizations involved with supplying professional services must be incorporated or chartered in the United States.  Consultants planning teaming arrangements must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.  In accordance with FAR 19.301, offerors will be required to submit self-certification relating to business size.  The competitive proposals method of solicitation as set forth in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1) shall be utilized for this procurement.  This solicitation in no way obligates TDA to award a contract, nor does it commit TDA to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal.  Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of this solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for reply to reach the offerors before submission of their offerors.  All oral explanations or instruction, given before award of this contract will not be binding.  Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning the solicitation will be furnished promptly to all prospective offerors as an amendment of the solicitation, if such information is necessary to offerors submitting proposals or if lack of such information would be prejudicial to uninformed offerors.

The contractor must be in the position to present fair and unbiased information pursuant to the statement of work. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on/about (15) fifteen days after the publication date of this synopsis.  Because of the urgency of this request, the closing date for receipt of proposals will be twenty-one (21) days thereafter.  Only written requests for the RFP that indicate the company?s size will be honored.  U.S. eligible small businesses interested in receiving the RFP should preferably send an email to contract@tda.gov.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with Wyatt Technology Corporation, Santa Barbara, California to furnish, deliver and install a new DAWN EOS - Light Scattering Detector System and Accessories at the USDA, ARS, NAA, Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC), 600 E. Mermaid Lane, Wyndmoor, PA 19038. The USDA, ARS, ERRC, Fats, Oils, and Animal Coproducts Research Unit  (FOAC) has determined that the Wyatt Technologies DAWN EOS light scattering detector and Optilab interferometric refractometer will be used in conjunction with another DAWN EOS to determine the absolute molar masses of the bacterial polymers studied in our lab.  The current DAWN EOS system is used in our lab to determine polymer molar mass utilizes a polystyrene calibration curve and the unknown molar masses are determined by comparing retention times through a column.  Since polystyrene is completely different structurally than the polymers that we are interested in, the molar masses derived from our current system are inaccurate.  The DAWN EOS detector measures the light scattered by a polymer at 18 different angles.  When used in conjunction with the Optilab refractometer we will be able to determine accurate absolute molar masses and also determine other parameters (radius of gyration, branching properties, etc.) about the polymers that we are presently unable to determine. For FOAC's intended applications, an instrument with 18 different angles is critical since it determines the reproducibility of the measurements, accuracy of the molar mass, size determination. The DAWN EOS Detector System includes the following accessories and components: 1) Peltier driven temperature regulation from approximately -15 degrees Celsius to +80 degrees Celsius (+/- 0.1 degree Celsius); 2) ASTRA Software (windows based).  The data acquisition software package is windows-based data collection and analysis program for HPLC light scattering that determines number, weight and z-average molecular weights and rms sizes and their distribution; 3)Optilab DSP -Interferometric Refractometer for use at 690nm; 4) Wyatt Comet - Cell Operation and Maintenance-Enhancing Technology Device; 5) Chromatographic (Hydrophobic PVDF, 02.um.) Filter Kit; 6) Ambient Cell Cleaning Kit; 7) DNDC Kit; 8) Technical Support to include unlimited free telephone, e-mail and FAX support for one year; 9)Installation;  10) 3-day training (including air-fare) in Santa Barbara, CA prior to delivery and installation; and 11) one set of the operations, repair and maintenance manuals, service instructions, and software operating instructions.  In addition, a one-year parts and labor warranty on the equipment is required.  The Contractor shall also provide a copy of any available extended warranties and costs.  DELIVERY shall be F.O.B. Destination, within Consignee's Premises AFTER October 15, 2002, as mutually agreed with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative who will be named at time of award.  The Government has determined that Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, standards 1194.21 through 1194.25 applies to the above system.  INSTALLATION shall be completed not later than two weeks after delivery. The Government shall purchase the required PC and printer. Companies with the demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide and service such equipment, warranty must submit a written substantive statement outlining the Company's and systems' capabilities, available service agreements and consumables (including price lists) and the required p.c. and printer specifications to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of publication of this notice.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Emergency Training Center (NETC), Emergency Management Institute (EMI) has an Emergency Management Higher Education project/requirement for development of a college- level course entitled, ?Hazards Risk Management?. This is 100% small business set aside.  The associated NAICS code is 611430, Professional Development Training, and the small business size standard is $6.0 million [average annual receipts for three preceding fiscal years].   A goal of FEMA?s is to encourage and support the expansion of hazard, disaster and emergency management related education in colleges and universities across the U.S. so that in the future more emergency management and related personnel in government and the private sector will come to the job not only with a college education, but with a course of study, if not a degree, in emergency management as well.  This will help contribute to the professionalism of emergency management and the expansion of emergency management knowledge and principles in other professions and disciplines as well, all of which contributes to building disaster resistant and resilient communities of tomorrow.  Toward that end, EMI, located at the NETC in Emmitsburg, Maryland, developed the Emergency Management Higher Education Project, which its primary purpose is to encourage and support the development of hazard, disaster and emergency management bachelor and graduate degree programs within U.S. colleges and universities.  Each Emergency Management Higher Education Project course shall be developed within the philosophical context of (1) building disaster resistant and resilient communities; and (2) seeking balance between the technocratic and the social vulnerability reduction approaches to emergency management.  Please refer to the Higher Education Project Slide Presentation at the following website address:  http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/highedbrief_course 2.ppt     Each Emergency Management Higher Education Project course shall be developed by college/university faculty with doctoral credentials and upper division college-level teaching experience.  In addition, course developers should have emergency management or disaster field research experience.  The purpose of this requirement is to develop a 45-48 contract hour classroom-based college course on ?Hazards Risk Management?.  FEMA is currently developing a college course entitled ?Hazards Risk Assessment? and the Hazards Risk Management course is intended as a complementary follow-up to the prerequisite Hazards Risk Assessment course, within a program of study leading to a bachelors? degree in emergency management.  The Hazards Risk Management Course will focus on how the risk management decision-making process is used in the context of hazards and emergency management.  The risk management decision making process will help emergency managers decide whether the public entity should actively manage a risk or give it a lower priority.  It will also help emergency managers decide whether to retain financial responsibility for the costs associated with a hazard or use risk financing techniques, such as insurance, to transfer all or part of the financial risk of that hazard.  For hazards that are actively managed, the risk management process will help emergency managers more effectively advocate to decision makers the program, planning and policy initiatives they recommend.  The goal of this course is to contribute to reducing the toll of disasters in the United States by halting and eventually reversing the increasing disaster losses the U.S. has experienced over the last several decades.  Without intervention, these losses have been projected to worsen over the next several decades.  The final product shall be a complete and ready-to-use course that could be taught as is at a 4-year accredited college and university at the junior to senior level.  The course shall be developed so as to enhance student understanding of emergency management principles and applications relevant to disaster recovery planning and be developed within the philosophical context of ?Building Disaster Resistant and Resilient Communities,? which places priority emphasis on prevention, mitigation and vulnerability reduction.  The course shall also be developed within the context of seeking balance between the two bi-polar approaches to U.S. emergency management: the dominant-technocratic approach and the more recent ?social vulnerability? approach.  The course shall fulfill the requirements of a standard 3-semester hour college course at the junior to senior level and be developed so that is can be taught within an emergency management major or certificate program to students who may someday enter an emergency management related profession.  All course materials must be Section 508 compliant. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed-price purchase order will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures (under $100,000.00).  The award will be based on best value to the Government, in accordance with the evaluation factors set forth in the Request for Quotation (RFQ) package.  Quotes will be due 30 days from the release date of the RFQ.  See numbered note #1.  Potential offers must request the RFQ package in writing to:  Cindy Adams, NETC Acquisition Section, 16825 South Seton Avenue, Emmitsburg, MD  21727 or e:mail to:  cindy.adams@fema.gov

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Adventist Cardiac Services (Washington Adventist Hospital), Fairfax Hospital, Georgetown University Hospital, and Washington Heart at Washington Hospital Center for cardiac surgery and coronary angioplasty services in support of the patients of its Cardiology Branch and of its former Surgery Branch.  The NHLBI has kept a previous commitment to its patients to provide or obtain for them the interventions that may be needed for their medical conditions.  The required surgical services were originally performed in-house in the former Surgery Branch, DIR, NHLBI and subsequently obtained under three noncompetitive contracts until four competitive contracts were awarded pursuant to RFP NHLBI-HI-91-03 and subsequently RFP NHLBI-HI-96-02.  The purpose of these four contracts is to provide for continued cardiac surgery and coronary angioplasty services required by NHLBI's Cardiology Branch for the period September 1, 1996 through August 31, 2001.  The contracts were subsequently extended for an additional year ending August 31, 2002 on a noncompetitive basis.  The Institute is in process of restoring in-house surgical capability, and consequently, no competitive follow-on award is planned.  However, logistic difficulties have delayed this restoration process, and it is believed that the capability will not be achieved until next September (2003).  As a result, for considerations of the safety and well-being of our patients, it is necessary to extend the current contracts for the interim period of up to one additional year.  Sources that can be considered capable of providing the required services must be fully accredited and licensed hospitals approved to perform the full range of cardiac procedures including open heart surgery, within a radius of 30 minutes by ground, to permit emergency transport of patients from the Clinical Center and to permit the required level of close consultation between the treating surgeons and the NHLBI physicians for their patients.  Sources other than the incumbent four contractors that wish to be considered for a contract for this work are invited to submit evidence of their qualifications and proximity.  CBD Note 22: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA)

High-Power Solid-State Laser Development Program  


DESCRIPTION 

A.	INTRODUCTION:  
The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (DE) at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving affordable proposals for high-power solid-state laser development.  The total program budget range for these efforts is approximately $20M to $49M over 24 to 36 months.  The projected start date will be during the first quarter FY03.  AFRL anticipates making one or two awards depending on the availability of funds.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), Capt. Kalliroi Lagonik, High-Power Solid-State Lasers Branch (AFRL/DELO), (505) 853-2001, is encouraged until proposals are received.  In addition, AFRL evaluators may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the evaluation.  
B.	TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA:  
Contractors funded under this accelerated laser development program will use modeling and simulation, analysis, design, experimentation, and testing to demonstrate and deliver to the Air Force a 25 kW-class, near diffraction limited, diode-pumped solid-state laser.  Although our primary interest is in solid-state lasers, other electrically driven laser concepts that clearly address the cost, schedule, and performance goals of this solicitation may also be considered for funding.  Modeling and simulation should be validated by the experiments performed on the 25 kW laser then used to assess scalability to the 100 kW average power level.  Emphasis will be placed on laser architectures that are scalable to the 100 kW average power level and are favorable in terms of size, weight, efficiency, reliability, maintainability, supportability, environmental acceptability, and ruggedness. The laser should be modularized (i.e., the laser head physically separated from the power supplies, control console and chiller) to support the installation and safe operation at Government facilities and to facilitate eventual testing using platform specific systems.  For similar reasons, provision shall be made for remote control of the deliverable device.  AFRL is specifically interested in approaches that address the following goals: 
a.	The average power of the laser output beam shall be at least 25 kW.
b.	The laser beam quality shall be better than 1.5 times the diffraction limit (xDL), with a goal of 1.2 xDL.  The beam quality specification shall be based on a power-in-the-bucket (PITB) measurement in the far-field.  This beam quality shall be maintained for the entire run time of 300 seconds as specified in (f).
c.	The contractor shall perform an intermediate stage laser demonstration at an average output power and beam quality that clearly shows scalability to the program goal outlined in (a) and (b) and demonstrates the critical components, methodology, and design of the final 25 kW laser.  At this point, the contractor will assess the risk involved in reaching the 25 kW power level and present a written status report and risk reduction plan to the Government.  
d.	The laser system wall-plug efficiency shall be greater than 10%.  Herein, wall-plug efficiency is defined as the average optical output power of the laser divided by the sum of all electrical average power delivered to all power supplies, drivers, cooling systems, pumps, and control devices used in the laser.
e.	Start-up time:  The start-up time requirement for the laser shall be 1 s with a goal of 250 ms. This is defined as the time required to go from a stand-by (non-lasing) condition to a condition where all output requirements are met.  
f.	For the Phase II laboratory demonstration the laser run time shall be unlimited.  All performance measurements on the Phase II device (power, beam quality, etc.) shall be recorded over a time period of at least 300 seconds.  The Phase III packaged laser shall have a run time (magazine) greater than 300 seconds as measured from the time the output power meets the requirements of (a) and (b) to the time that either the optical input power is shut down or the power supply and/or the cooling subsystem need recharging.  Provisions shall be made for reasonable on/off cycling (e.g., two to several second bursts, then return to stand-by).  The run time only includes the sum of the laser-on periods.  
g.	Beam jitter:  The total beam jitter shall be no greater than 5% of the far-field instantaneous beam diameter as measured at the Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) power points.  The contractor should assume that the laser will be mounted on an isolated table-the table will not induce jitter in the laser head.
h.	The waste heat from the laser shall be delivered in a mode compatible with an on-board aircraft heat exchanger.  There shall be no open cycle or blow down cooling techniques used in the laser.  The coolant type and flow rates will be consistent with an acceptable aircraft thermal management system.
i.	For Phase III, the average output power to mass ratio for the laser shall be greater than 20W/kg.  The contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that they will be able to demonstrate this output power to mass ratio in Phase III. For Phases I and II, the contractor must clearly show a path to this output power to mass ratio.  The laser is nominally defined as the laser head plus the system heat exchangers, coolers, power supplies, wiring, tubing, etc.  The laser head typically includes gain media and associated fixed attachments (diodes, heat exchangers, mechanical structures, etc), optics, mounts, along with a base plate, cover, and necessary fixtures.
j.	For the Phase III deliverable, the ambient operating temperature range of the device should be 5 to 35 degrees C, and the device?s storage temperature range should be -20 to 40 degrees C.   

For item (a), the contractor shall discuss in their proposal how they intend to measure the laser?s output power and what the possible error bars will be on such a measurement.  For item (b), the contractor shall specify in their proposal both a definition of beam quality based on PITB (not M-squared) and a discussion of how the measurement will be performed, including any issues impacting measurement accuracy.  The contractor must also define how measurements will be made for items (d), (e), and (g).  
This effort will include three phases.  Under Phase I the contractor will demonstrate an intermediate stage laser as defined in requirement (c).  The contractor will also brief the status of the program, provide a risk reduction plan, and conduct a preliminary design review of the Phase III deliverable laser.  Phase II will end with a 25 kW laser demonstration at the contractor?s facility, delivery to the government of sufficient supporting documentation and materials to adequately assess program status and risks, and a critical design review of the Phase III deliverable 25 kW laser device.  Phase III, separately priced as Option 1, will require that the contractor deliver a packaged brassboard 25 kW laser to an Air Force or other DOD facility for test and evaluation.  The delivered brassboard shall include: (a) laser bench, including laser head(s), optics and pumping system; (b) power supply, including power condition, power conversion, but excluding power generation; (c) control console; (d) thermal management system, including pumps, chillers, coolant tanks and plumbing; (e) sufficient documentation, data and on-site training to ensure a smooth transition to a government facility.  No beam control or pointing system will be delivered with the Phase III device.  However, the contractor will ensure that the characteristics of the output beam do not somehow preclude ready insertion into an agreed upon beam delivery system at the Government facility.  Phases I and II will be accomplished in 24 months while Phase III, Option 1, will be accomplished in 12 months, for a total of 36 months.  It is anticipated that upon successful completion of Phase II, another solicitation will be put forth to develop a 100 kW laser.  That solicitation will be full and open competition, i.e., not restricted to the 25 kW awardee(s).

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to award a sole source cost reimbursement, no fee contract to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review existing R&D data collection systems and relevant literature in the field, commission appropriate papers, identify gaps in current methodology, and hold workshops on its findings. Work will be performed by the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) and the Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP). 

The NSF/Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS) seeks a comprehensive review of  the portfolio of activities that comprise the SRS Research and Development Statistics Program.  An assessment will be made of the content, coverage, focus, substance and methodology of data collection and analyses on research and development and related science and engineering activities.  The assessment will include a review of current and necessary statistical and measurement issues, including (but not limited to) sampling design, periodicity, construct validity and respondent burden.

The STEP workshop steering committee shall address how the current RDS data collection system can be improved to reflect the changing nature of research, development, and innovation, and include recommendations on the issues of composition, structure, sourcing and location, particularly in the context of the industrial R&D and federal funds surveys, covering the majority of U.S. R&D funding and performance. CNSTAT will appoint a panel of experts representing the fields of statistics, survey research, economics, data analysis, research policy, and research and development to review current data collection systems and methodology, and to hold a workshop on R&D measurement methodology. 

NAS will prepare a report summarizing overall findings and recommending priorities and options for revised or enhanced SRS R&D data collection and acquisition activities. The anticipated contract will have an estimated period of performance of 24 months.  NAS is uniquely qualified to develop the advice required in the report. NAS was established by Congress to provide independent advice to the Federal Government on critical matters of science, technology and medicine by enlisting the participation of the nation?s top scientists, doctors and other experts.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with the New England Aquarium Central Wharf to conduct a series of studies and activities relating to apparent failure of reproduction in western North Atlantic right whales.  The studies and activities include: a study of reproductive dysfunction using reproductive and stress steroid hormones from fecal samples; a new initiative on marine biotoxins (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning Toxin, PSP) and their potential impact on right whale health and reproduction; and a parasitology feasibility study to assess the occurrence of gastrointestinal parasites in right whales and the potential for impacts on health and reproduction.  The agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction, and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery, and safeguard the quality of their habitat.   In order to guide research programs, knowledge of the hormonal status of the whales is needed to help to determine which part of the reproductive cycle is being affected and to better characterize the nature of the reproductive dysfunction.    The period of performance will be fourteen months from date of contract award. The New England Aquarium Central Wharf has previously validated assays in right whales for four steroid hormones: total estrogen, progesterone, testosterone and glucocorticoids (adrenal stress hormones) and is uniquely qualified as a significant portion of the work identified for the proposed requirement depends upon specialized knowledge regarding the biology of North Atlantic right whales, the capability to obtain the necessary samples, the capability to perform specialized laboratory analyses, and the ability to identify individual animals.   The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.   Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of  their capability to respond to the requirement by August 1, 2002.  Written requests may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.   The solicitation document will be issued on or about August 5, 2002.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution  to conduct a study of body condition (assessed through blubber thickness and structure) in North Atlantic right whales.  The agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction, and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery, and safeguard the quality of their habitat.  Investigation of the body condition of the North Atlantic right whale is important for management of this population.  The main objective of the proposed project is to gather data on body condition as a marker of nutritional status in order to gain a better fundamental understanding of its significance to apparent recruitment failure of the North Atlantic right whale population.  These observations will be compared with data from a parallel project studying a reference population of the southern right whale.   Body condition of right whales will be assessed during the summer of 2002 in the Bay of Fundy.   The period of performance will be thirteen months from date of contract award. The proposed requirement supplements initial work by Michael Moore and colleagues at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI; Moore et al 2001) and requires specialized techniques, equipment and experience that is known to be available at only one institution.   WHOI has developed a unique system for ultrasound-based measurements of body condition of large whales which requires a specially outfitted vessel along with custom computer software for data management and analysis as well as experience with application and interpretation of the technique.   The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.   Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of  their capability to respond to the requirement by August 1, 2002.  Written requests may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.   The solicitation document will be issued on or about August 5, 2002.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>This the second announcement that the Air Force intends to hold an Industry Day for preliminary market research and informational purposes as it relates to a Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) system.  The original announcement was posted 12 July 2002.  This announcement provides additional information regarding the exact date and time of the event and reduces the security requirements for attendees.  Firms that responded to the first announcement do not have to duplicate their responses.

The goal of this session is to identify companies who are interested and qualified to participate in the study and subsequent development of this system.  In April 1996, an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) was launched to demonstrate Space-Based Space Surveillance Operations (SBSSO).  The SBSSO sensor, the Space Based Visible (SBV) telescope, is the last surviving sensor on the Mid-course Space experiment (MSX) and reaches its predicted end of life in FY05.  A follow-on capability is needed to meet Space Control requirements for significantly improved detection and timeliness of high interest space event reports.  SBSS is the next-generation family of these systems. Notionally a constellation of electro-optical sensing satellites, SBSS will search for, detect, and track objects in near earth and deep space orbits.  In order to facilitate FY03 acquisition activities, an SBSS Industry Day is planned for 05 August 02 from 1300-1600 at the SMC/AD Mission Area Prime Integration Contractor (MAPIC) facility, Building R2, Room 2191; TRW Systems Campus, Redondo Beach, CA.  The agenda will include MAPIC presentation of an FY00 Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Study that merged Capstone Requirement Document (CRD) requirements with Mission Area Plan needs to support Defensive Counterspace Strategies.  The briefing will take place at the DoD Secret level; as such, please fax clearances to TRW Security, Attn: Mark Mason at (310) 546-7833.  In addition to sending clearances, interested companies are limited to four (4) attendees each and should RSVP with Mr. Joe Vanderpoorten by telephone at (310) 812-4032, or by email: Joe.vanderpoorten@trw.com.  Please direct any questions or comments of a contractual nature to SMC/ADK, Capt Garth Arevalo by telephone at (310) 416-1571, or by email: garth.arevalo@losangeles.af.mi

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   This is a correction to the previous synopsis posted on 6/10/02.  The small business set-aside requirement is deleted.  This procurement will be processed using full and open competition under FAR Part 13 (simplified acquisition procedures).  The SIC IS 541990.  It is anticipated that a request for quotations shall be issued on 8/5/02 with quotes due 8/15/02.   The U.S. EPA, ORD, National Risk Management Research Lab., Water Supply Water Resources Div. (WSWRD), Edison. The contractor will develop a field scale, process-based simulation tool for design,  performance planning, and evaluation of common construction site best management practices (BMP).  It is a process-based risk management approach to soil erosion and sediment transport control at construction sites.  The EPA considers soil erosion and sediment transport from construction sites  larger than 5 acres in urban lands as statutory point sources and regulated these sites under Phase I of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).  EPA, under Phase II of the NPDES program (mandatory, 3/10/2003), requires permits for sites 1 acre and larger.  The States are  taking measures to address construction site erosion control.  Results from these programs will help develop technical guidance for tracking and evaluating erosion control measures at construction sites across the nation (e.g., USEPA 2001).  The EPA needs a process-based model to predict the  performance of the common, small-scale, construction site BMPs, covered under Phase II, namely, filter fences, rolled erosion control systems or similar practices.  The model calibrated under field conditions can be initially used as a simulation tool to select among alternative designs under  a  more extensive set of conditions than could be tested empirically.  These modeled BMP performance scenarios can be used to provide state of the practice BMP standards and specifications for silt fence and rolled erosion systems.  The standards would cover material types, methods for limiting slope  lengths, drainage areas, quantifying additional design parameters, and guidance for installation and maintenance.  A design aid is required that would be a more user friendly extension of the process-based model as a spreadsheet model that would include algorithms and appropriate steps for  predicting site-specific design parameters such as those listed by Fitfield (2001) that would be used to specify final designs and maintenance.   All interested parties should submit a request to Angela Thompson, using the following methods:  (1) In writing to the above address, (2) by fax  (513/487-2107) or by E-mail (tompson.angie@epa.gov) referencing solicitation RFQ-OH-02-00190.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse is seeking capability statements from qualified organizations having in-house capability of developing, evaluating, and disseminating science education materials for students at the middle school level, teachers, and parents.  A project with the following objectives is planned:  1) develop new science education materials in a format involving drug addiction to generate excitement and enthusiasm for science by engaging middle school age children and adults in the process of science; 2) development of corresponding materials for teachers (i.e. a teachers guide) and parents.  The materials must comply with the National Science Education Standards available at http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses/ for specific use in the classroom; and 3) development of CD-ROM and print materials.  The primary goals of the CD-ROM and these materials will be: 1) to develop new materials for use at the middle school level that are consistent with the NIDA's Brain Power Junior Scientist; 2) to improve science education and literacy among the targeted audiences, particularly as it relates to how drugs act in the brain and body; 3) to foster an enthusiasm among children for science; and 4) to ensure that students understand that science is a dynamic discipline that involves curiosity and questioning.  It is anticipated that the proposed CD-ROM materials will be field tested in schools which represent the intellectual and diversity spectrum found in middle schools across the nation.  All of the materials will be in the public domain and will not be copyrighted.  Interested organizations must be able to perform the following types of tasks: 1) develop age appropriate, colorful, creative and interesting science education materials and CD-ROMS that will appeal to middle school-age children; 2) develop CD-ROMs to reinforce important concepts with hands-on activities that make the concepts more exciting and engaging to the students; 3) write curricula that adheres to the National Science Education Standards and is easily incorporated into the usual middle school curriculum; 4) develop materials for teachers that can be used as a guide and that will include classroom activities; 5) develop materials for parents that provide information which can be used to reinforce what the children are learning in the classroom, and which include science-related activities for the entire family;  6) develop and conduct evaluation protocol of the educational materials and CD-ROMs.  Interested organizations must be able to demonstrate, in any capability statement submitted, extensive experience in the following areas:  1) the ability to perform the above tasks, and specific expertise in the development of curriculum materials for middle school grades; 2) experience in the development of materials for teachers and parents; 3) a knowledge of the National Science Education Standards; 4) experience in the development and production of interactive educational CD-ROMs and print materials, graphics; 5) expertise in evaluation and assessment of curricula; 6) dissemination of information and materials to teachers and  7) experience in preparation of OMB clearances.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  This notice is for information purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement.  Interested organizations submitting a capability statement in response to this sources sought are required to identify their size status.  Written capability statements must be submitted no later than July 31, 2002  to NIDA, 6001 Executive Boulevard, Room 3105, MSC 9543, Bethesda, MD  20892-9543, Attn: Diane Loeb.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) seeks a qualified firm to provide an automated Time, Attendance and Scheduling system initially for passenger and baggage screeners and Federal Air Marshals (FAMs), and ultimately the entire agency.  The estimated initial workforce is 70,000 individuals located throughout the nation, all fifty (50) States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam.  The TSA seeks a firm with a demonstrated history of successful implementations of similar scope and magnitude.  In line with current Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congressional guidance, the system must be commercial off the shelf software (COTS).  The vendor must provide the full range of Engineering, Hardware, Software, Maintenance, Helpdesk and Training Services.  A variety of time capture mechanisms are required ? direct/online entry, for office personnel; remote access via a telephone or similar device; and time clock entry (possibly biometric, card swipe, bar code reader or other similar technology) for screeners.  There is a goal to minimize the amount of ongoing technical support in the field, so the data collected should be verified, corrected (as necessary) and approved via a browser-based or similar technology that reduces the amount of software to be maintained and updated on the supervisor?s PC or similar device.  As these data will need to be interfaced to the Department of Transportation?s (DOT) legacy Time and Attendance system, Integrated Payroll Personnel System (IPPS) and accept data inputs from the DOT?s legacy personnel, Consolidated Personnel Management Information System (CPMIS) and the payroll systems, Consolidated Uniform Payroll System (CUPS).  A robust and flexible toolset for interface development is required.  

Interested parties shall submit a qualification statement, not exceeding ten (10) pages that address the following issues.

a.	Identify two (2) installations of similar scope and magnitude that your company performed as prime contractor.  Similar scope and magnitude is defined as national wide implementation of a system covering at least 50,000 employees.  Provide the name of the customer(s), name(s) of the point of contract, with telephone number.  Identify whether it was a Government or commercial entity.
b.	General Corporate capabilities, to include, but not limited to; length of time in business, number of employees, locations nation wide and manufacturing capability.
c.	Identify the work force management and measurement features of the system which track and automatically report schedules, overtime, attendance, and actual vs. schedule variances.

A Government Team will evaluate the qualification statements received and will determine which submission meets the Governments need/requirement, as stated above.  Any Contractor who fails to meet the requirement may be excluded from any further consideration.

Responses may be submitted via facsimile, to (202) 493-1746, email, to paul.casagrande@tsa.dot.gov or sent to:  Department of Transportation, Transportation Security Administration, Office of Acquisition, Attn:  Paul A Casagrande, 400 ? 7th St. S.W., Washington, DC 20590.  Responses are due by close of business Friday, July 31, 2002.

<SUBJECT>13 -- Request for Information, General Purpose (GP) MK-84, Insensitive Munition (IM) Bomb Case Modification Technology
<DESC>Special Notice.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) from industry sources to determine the availability of mature and proven bomb case designs that would help the current MK-84 meet the Insensitive Munitions (IM) requirements of MIL-STD-2105B. The Air Armament Center (AAC), Precision Strike Systems Project Office, Project Division, (AAC/WMGD) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Energetic Materials Branch, (AFRL/MNME), are currently managing a joint R&D effort that will result in compliance with the IM requirements of MIL-STD 2105B for the MK-84 General Purpose (GP) bomb.  Research by AFRL/MNME concerning the appropriate insensitive high explosive fill suitable for insertion into the bomb case is being conducted concurrently and separately and is not yet complete.  The government believes that to achieve IM compliance with the MK-84, the contributions from both a less sensitive fill and bomb case design modifications must be considered.  The Key Performance Parameters of the MK-84 IM Technology Program (including contributions by both the fill and the bomb case) follow:  Threshold Requirements:  1.  Equal or better operational performance (Pk)  than Tritonal.  2.  Equal or better IM response than the current GP bomb filled with the explosive PBXN-109, currently used by the US Navy.  3.  The MK-84, with the new explosive fill, will be compatible with the USAF inventory of fuzes (and those currently under development) as well as PAVEWAY tail kits and guidance packages.  4.  Preserve the current MK-84 mass properties, thereby minimizing flight recertification.  Goals: 1.  Fully meet IM requirements for the MK-84.  2.  Reduce the current Hazard classification from 1.1 to either 1.2.3 or 1.6.  Respondents to this RFI are requested to provide information, including supporting data, such as designs/modifications, drawings and test results, concerning the availability of a bomb case design/modified MK-84 case design, that would meet the parameters identified above.  THIS RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION REQUESTED, TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT.   No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government?s use of submitted information.  The information provided as a result of this RFI may be used by the Air Force in future acquisition strategy decisions and could be used in future RFP(s) which may be released to industry.  Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights.  However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately.   Send replies to this request for information within 30 days of the date of this announcement to Ms Chris Asbill, Contract Specialist, AAC/WMGK, 102 West D Ave., Bldg 11, Suite 300, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-6810, or sent electronically to ellen.asbill@eglin.af.mil  using the following subject line:   GENERAL PURPOSE (GP) MK-84, INSENSITIVE MUNITION (IM) BOMB CASE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY.

<SUBJECT>U -- CarePlanner.Espanol
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a Sole Source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedure (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm fixed price award to Clinical Tools Inc., 431 W. Franklin Street, Suite 24, Chapel Hill, N.C.  27516.  This tool will provide easy understanding to educational information to help families and individuals understand health, treatment, daily living and caregiver issues that need to be considered in decisionmaking.  This tool needs to be available to broaden audiences with limited English proficiency beginning with the Hispanic/Latino communities.  The English version of CarePlanner includes the following features:  (1) It identifies necessary modifications, services, and supports needed to manage the risks in any setting. (2) It allows caseworkers, beneficiaries and treatment professionals to assess actual settings a beneficiary is considering.  This second level of assessment identifies quality, health and safety issues not addressed in the first level assessment. (3) It weighs risks to identify those that are most likely to affect the health and safety of the beneficiary. (4) It is based on evidence and ?best practices? in the field of home and community based services for assessing the relative risks of different types of community alternatives and the risks associated with features of a specific type of living arrangement.  Combining this information with information about the consumer?s abilities and disabilities, it provides a systematic matching of the consumer?s needs and the supports offered by particular community alternatives. (5) It addresses the needs of physically disabled individuals with like health conditions and abilities similar to seniors.  It does not address risks and needs that are unique to people with developmental disabilities, chronic mental health conditions, and children with other special health care needs.  And, while the primary reason for developing the tool was to assist state agencies programs, beneficiaries, caregivers, agencies and organizations that counsel seniors, other Federal agencies are using CarePlanner.    Also, Clinical Tools, Inc., is the only vendor with the proprietary knowledge of the CarePlanner design, content and database, which is essential to the Spanish version of this tool.  The content of CarePlanner also draws heavily upon research conducted by Clinical Tools, Inc., in developing SeniorCareWeb, which is a website developed by Clinical Tools, Inc., with a SBIR grant from the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.
