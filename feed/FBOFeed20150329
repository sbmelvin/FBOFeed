The work phases are identified as follows:

Phase I work includes relocating the existing sink and providing temporary wall to isolate the clean staff area from the contractors work area.  This phase must be completed while the SPS area is unoccupied by staff.  The space is available to the contractor after normal business hours at 5:00 PM on Friday and must be renovated and available for use on Monday at 8:00 AM.  The duration of this phase is one weekend.

Phase II work includes renovating the original sink utilities and providing all rough-in piping and connections for the new VA furnished sink.  Work in phase II can be conducted at any time but shall be coordinated with Engineering Staff to limit disruptions to the adjacent hospital areas.  Some afterhours work will be required for connections to hospital utilities including domestic water, DI water and medical air.  Duration of this phase is three weeks. 

Phase III work includes removal of the temporary sink and wall and installing the new sink in the prepared location.  This space is available to the contractor at 5:00 PM on Friday and must be renovated and available for use on Monday at 6:00 AM.  Duration of this phase is one weekend.
Purpose and Restrictions:

Work will continue without stopping until completed.

Outline of Work & Requirements:

"	Install new utilities and reroute existing utilities to facilitate the installation of the new 3-compartment sink.  Provide angle stops at all locations.  Provide standard hospital grade air outlets to match the existing at locations shown.  Coordinate all utility tie-ins to limit disruptions with the use of the area by VA Staff.

"	 Repair ceramic wall tile to match the existing.  Install new welded seam sheet vinyl flooring where base cabinet was removed.  Provide flexible connections from wall stops to facilitate new connections at new sink.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.
