The evaluation will consist of two (2) Phases.  Competitive proposals submitted in Phase I will be evaluated based on the technical evaluation  criteria set forth in the solicitation package. The technical proposals shall not include prices or pricing information.  Offerors should submit technical proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation of information.  The Government may mak e a final determination regarding a technical proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal as submitted.  The Government may proceed with the second phase without requesting further information from any offeror, however the Government may r equest additional information from offerors of proposals that it considers reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable and may discuss proposals with their offerors.  A “Notice of Unacceptability” will be forward to offerors upon completion of the Phas e I evaluation whose technical proposals were determined to be unacceptable.  In Phase II, only those offerors whose proposals are determined to be acceptable will be allowed to submit price proposals. The evaluation in Phase II will be of the offeror’s pr ice proposal.  The price proposal must be based on the offeror’s own technical proposal.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Large business firms that are selected to continue onto Phase II are required  to submit a subcontracting plan at the time for receipt of their price proposals.  The following subcontracting dollar goals pertain only to the dollar value of the contract that is subcontracted.  60% of the subcontracted dollar value shall be for small businesses, of that 60%, 15% shall be for small disadvantaged businesses, 8% shall be for women owned small businesses, 3% shall be for HUB Zone small businesses, 3% shall be for veteran owned small businesses and 3% shall be for Service Disabled Veteran o wned small businesses.

The Contracting Officer shall advise the respondents considered not viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.  All respondents considered viable competitors will be advised that they may participate in the resultant acquisition.
Step Two (2) will use the Request for Proposals (RFP) to communicate Government requirements to prospective contractors and to solicit proposals.  During Step Two (2), the viable competitors will be required to submit a fully developed Technical and Price Proposals.  The RFP will thoroughly describe the Government's requirements.  The RFP will be issued to the prospective offerors by June 26, 2002.  The RFP will thoroughly describe the Government's requirements and the basis for the selection of the General Contractor.  The Government does not provide any stipend for the preparation of proposals to the offerors.  The offeror for this project can be a joint venture, partnership, corporation, association or any legal entity with collective contractual responsibility to successfully perform the project.  If the offeror is an entity comprised of more than one firm, the identity and credentials of the firms will be evaluated separate and as a whole.  Selecting an offeror is not restricted to any specific geographic area.  However, at least fifty percent of the construction work must be performed within the State of California.  The General Contractor must have a functional office in the State of California.  In response to the Presolicitation Notice, the potential offerors must submit the following by June 12, 2002 at 2:00 PM:  
1.	Submit a letter of intent for the advertised project.
2.	Submit summary level information for three to five projects previously performed by the Offeror resembling the advertised project.
3.	Submit description and a picture for each previous project.
4.	Submit information on building configuration, size, usage, and final cost for each previous project.
5.	Submit names, addresses and telephone numbers of the owner representatives for each previous project.
6.	Submit explanations for delays and liquidated damages for each previous project.
7.	Submit a construction organization chart explaining generic positions proposed for the advertised project.
8.	Identify minimum level of education and experience proposed for each generic position.
9.	Certify that specific individuals proposed later (in Step Two), would meet or exceed the minimum generic standards set in Phase One.                                  
10.	Submit a two-page maximum management plan for the advertised project;
11.	Provide proof of Offeror?s financial stability for the advertised project;
12.	Provide proof of Offeror?s bonding capacity for the advertised project;
13.	Provide release forms authorizing GSA to obtain performance related information for the previously completed projects, from the owners of the projects;
Every Offeror will be evaluated in the following categories:   
I.	Past Performance: This parameter evaluates level of similarity between the advertised project and projects performed in the past by the Offeror.   Each project will be evaluated for quality, budget and schedule compliance, owner satisfaction, and contractor response to warranty repairs.   The input for evaluation will be based on the Offeror?s response to the Presolicitation Natice and information obtained from the owner representatives who dealt with the Offeror on the project.   The owner representatives will be those identified by the Offeror in the Presolicitation Notice.  Any comparable project indicated by the Offeror, must be at least 75% complete in order for it to be considered for this evaluation.
II.	Proposed Corporate Organization: This parameter evaluates the corporate side of the Offeror?s organization.  It will examine and rate the firms overall experience, track record, credentials, management philosophy and approach to projects, and managerial level qualification.   Other parameters considered would be the corporate ability to complete projects on time and within budget, current corporate workload, and projected workload coinciding with the timing of the advertised project.
III.	Proposed Construction Teams: The construction team proposed by the Offeror will be generic, meaning it would signify generic positions with minimum envisaged level of experience, education, length of service, geographic availability, and assignment within the Offeror?s organization chart for the project.   Specific names are not required until StepTwo, to give the Offeror enough time to be short-listed and then plan and organize a certain group of individuals to the project team.

All submittals must identify with this announcement and solicitation number.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to procure wildlife management services via herding of Canada Geese.  Due to the continuing  increase in the number of Canada geese on the 570 acre property located at 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD,  NIST has a requirement for the services of  a trainer and registered, fully trained herding dog to restrict, minimize, and/or eliminate the presence of  the geese using standard herding practices.  No animals are to be harmed as a result of the dog's  activities.  The trainer and dog  must work effectively together to restrict  herding activities to only the geese.  Other wildlife on the site include deer, fox, groundhogs, raccoons, and a variety of  birds.  The contractor's objectives are to restrict the geese to the  areas immediately surrounding the ponds and wetland area to minimize goose/staff interaction around all buildings, walkways, and parking lots and to reduce the site-wide population to 100 Canada geese.  Herding services shall be conducted randomly on a weekly basis from several times per day to several times per week based on seasonal and migratory waterfowl practices, nesting periods, and/or nuisance activities.  The Contractor shall have sole ownership and responsibility for the dog(s) employed in this service.  Contractor must have an animal available to meet the requirements of this contract at all times (i.e., if primary animal is ill or injured, a backup must be available).  Contractor shall be responsible for  all shelter, care, transportation and veterinary services, and insurance.  As part of the evaluation process, offerors may be required to give an on-site demonstration of techniques to be utilized.  Evaluation will be based on the control of the animal by the handler and the responsiveness to command  in achieving the desired goal.  The Government anticipates a firm fixed price contract for a 12 month base year period with four one year option periods, if exercised.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The competitive solicitation, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  The solicitation, SB1341-02-R-0005, is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about November 1, 2001 and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.  Potential offers are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  There is no written solicitation document available, telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders lists will be maintained.  Potential offerors are required to direct all questions via email to Diane.Loeb@nist.gov.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for procuring material for the construction of a parachute for the  X-38 Project. The following materials are needed:  1) 2,280 yards of yellow 2 inch 200 Ib nylon ribbon. 2) 20,000 yards of blue 2 inch 200 Ib nylon ribbon.  3) 12,000 yards of NPS (natural pre-shrunk) 3/8" wide commercial nylon tape 4) 8,000 yards of .312" wide kevlar tape-light resin finish 5) 100 yds (pre production quantity) 5/16" Spectra Webbing 6) 3,000 yds (production quantity) 5/16" Spectra Webbing This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Bally Ribbon Mills.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonable available from only one source.  Bally Ribbon Mills was the original designer for the first drogue parachute for the X-38 project. The X-38 project needs to design and build a second drogue parachute. By procuring from Bally Ribbon Mills, the two drogues will have the same material properties. Purchasing from another vendor is impractical due to the time it takes to test out the materials.    The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 10, 2002.

<DESC>Type of Document: Modification to a Previous Presolicitation Notice

The synopsis issued on March 29, 2002 for a Combustion Nitrogen/Protein Analyzer is modified to identify the specialized features required to support the research programs at ERRC.  This synopsis, which supercedes the announcement of March 29, 2002, is modified as follows:

The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) intends to negotiate solely with CE Elantech Inc., in Lakewood, NJ to furnish and deliver (FOB Destination) one combustion nitrogen/protein analyzer for the USDA, ARS, Eastern Regional Research Center, Wyndmoor PA.  The instrument must comply with AOAC method 990.3 and AACC method 46-30 to meet a wide variety of research objectives.  To achieve these objectives the instrument must be capable of detection that routes 100% of the combustion gases into a GC column for separation prior to the subsequent detection by the thermal conductivity detector.  It must employ a continuous flow design that allows addition of alternate detectors as well as the capability for reconfiguration for other applications such as oxygen analysis and/or sulfur analysis without addition of optional detectors or furnaces.   The instrument must include software for the introduction of oxygen which automatically compensates for sample weight and matrix in order to conserve oxygen usage.  It must accept samples in the range of 10mg - 1 gram and report nitrogen in the range of .01 - 100%.  The
instrument will be equipped with an HPLC type of autosampler that allows direct, automated, injection of variable volume liquid samples directly into the combustion chamber.  Companies with the demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide and service such equipment must submit a written substantive statement outlining the capabilities that equal the required features stated in this synopsis and past performance information to verify responsibility to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of publication of this notice.  This is not a request for proposal nor is a solicitation available.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends on entering into a sole source procurement with Blue Atlas Interactive, LLC (BAI) of Germantown, MD, under the authority of FAR Subsection 13.106-1(b).  This procurement is for the continued analysis, design and development for an online system for Standard Reference Materials (SRM).  BAI designed and implemented the SRM site.  The site was developed using SQL Server/Cold Fusion applications.  The sole source determination is based on the detailed knowledge of the structure and composition of SRM HTML tables that were created by BAI and are still in use today.  BAI also developed an intricate and comprehensive search engine.  As the original designer of the site with a high-quality and comprehensive search, BAI is the only vendor that can re-establish a premiere site; complete an analysis of current and future applications; integrate online orders in a secure environment with the internal business system graphical user interface; and create and develop a plan for future expansion of the site.  This knowledge will speed up the implementation and diagnosis of problems.  BAI also has a complete knowledge of the business processes of SRM and the implementation of current web tools to facilitate those processes. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded.  No RFQ package is available.  Any interested party may submit, in writing, their capability statement to respond to this requirement.  However, a determination by the Government to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Center for Cancer Research(CCR) plans to enter into a sole source contract with Incyte Genomics, Inc., 3160 Porter Drive, Palo Alto, CA 94304, to acquire one set of Human Unigene I Easy to Spot PCR Products.  Incyte is the only provider of this unique set.  the Center for Cancer Research maintains a state-of-the-art facility for the production of gene microarrays.  The microarrays allow researchers to study simultaneously by differential expression of large numbers of cancer genes in normal and diseased or treated cells.  The CCR Microarray Facility uses modern lab automation and robotic methods to "print" these arrays by spotting small volumes of prepared cDNA clones (PCR products) at specific locations on specially prepared glass slides. (PCR products of cDNA clones from multiple thousands of genes can localized to a small glass slide.  The composition of the PCR sets and quality controls used in their manufacture are critically important for the continuation of existing experimental protocols and standards.  The NCI/CCR Microarray facility has ongoing projects utilizing Incyte products previously, having produced thousands of microarrays which are in use by intramural investigators and the NIH MouseModels of Human Diseases Consortium.  An important aspect is that the clones are not full-length copies of the genes of interest, but are biased towards the 3' end of the gene.  In pratical terms, this means that clone from the same genes, but generated from other vendors, will have a different composition.  It is critical for experimental continuity and reproducibility that the NCI/CCR continue to acquire from this source.  Incyte Genomics Inc., is the only company known to the Government that can meet the required specifications.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  Capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain sufficient material to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EST (local Washington, DC time) on May 21, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-509. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. NAICS Code 325413.

The Contractor shall follow the WSMR Environmental Office approved route staking plan (reference modification P00013 to Otero County Electric Cooperative contract DAAD07-69-C-0124) and as a part of the proposal submit rapt or-safe designs for the new structures in accordance with “Suggested Practices for Raptor Protection on Power Lines:  The State of the Art in 1996”, published by the Edison Electric Institute.  The Government-connected load does not exceed 29-kVA at 208 vA C, three phase (100 amp service).  The Contractor shall purchase and install a three phase transformer bank, fuses, switches, etc. to supply the TSN facility, 100-amp service, load.  The Government will be responsible for connecting the low side of the tra nsformers. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 41.201(d)(1), Section 8093 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 1988, P.L. 100-202, provides that none of the funds appropriated by the Act or any other Act with respect to any fisc al year by any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, may be used for the purchase of electricity by the Government in any manner that is inconsistent with state law governing the providing of electric utility service, including state  utility com mission rulings and electric utility franchises or service territories established pursuant to state statute, state regulation, or state-approved territorial agreements. In New Mexico, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission is constitutio nally created and is charged by the Legislature with regulating public utilities, telecommunications companies, and insurance companies to the extent necessary to provide just and reasonable rates and to assure reasonable, adequate and efficient service fo r the public. The commission issues Certification of Public Convenience and Necessity for construction and operation of public utility plant or system. Otero County Electric Cooperative (OCEC) has the franchise rights and authority to provide electric util ity services in Otero and Lincoln Counties. These facility assets have accumulated under a number of contracts going back to 1952. The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission regulates rates and service of electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives , including OCEC. The commission has issued Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity to OCEC, and only to OCEC, to provide electric utility service in Otero and Lincoln County, New Mexico. Otero County Electric Cooperative (OCEC) owns and services existing primary electrical power lines and equipment in this area. Therefore OCEC is the only organization capable of, and permitted to provide the required utility services in this area. See Note 22.

Title:  	Simplified Methods for Electrokinetic Focusing of Samples in Microfluidic Devices

Description:	Methods are described for the focusing of ionic species in microfluidic systems using electric field gradients that are generated without external electrical connections.  

In the first example, the electric field within a microchannel is effected by putting a highly or partially conductive material inside portions of the channel.  The conductive material can consist, for example, of a metal film on the channel walls.  The presence of conductive material will alter the total conductivity of the microchannel, and thereby alter the electric field in the microchannel.  Regions of different electric field can be created by applying different films (or no films) to different regions of the microchannel.  The electric field gradients at the borders between these different regions can then be used to focus and concentrate ionic species by balancing their electrophoretic velocities with an applied bulk fluid velocity.  

In the second example, the electric field gradient which is used for electrokinetic focusing is created by application of a temperature gradient.  In order for this to work, the conductivity of the buffer within the microchannels must depend on temperature in a way that differs from the typical inverse proportionality with the buffer viscosity.  For example, it must have an ionic strength that is temperature dependent.

Also discussed is a related method which can be used to produce streams of either concentrated or diluted analytes.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). Statement of Work to Provide Access to General Aviation Ground and Flight Training Activities   Background: As part of NASA's Aviation Safety Program (AvSP), emphasis is being placed on training issues.  With the decrease in the number of pilots coming out of the military, General Aviation (GA) training is gaining importance as the major source for commercial pilots.

<DESC>D?INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM (ILS). The Library at the National Gallery of Art, a national resource for art research with a growing collection of over 200,000 volumes, 2,400 serials, 180,000 slides, and 2.5 million photographs, seeks to replace its existing library system with a modern, commercial library system. The ILS will manage the Library's core operations in technical services (acquisitions and fund accounting, cataloging and authority control, serials control, and physical processing), reader services (online public catalog, interlibrary loan, and circulation and inventory), and digital resource management.  This fully integrated system must support a wide variety of library functions, including some that may be unique to the NGA library, and allow staff and researchers to locate and manage information from internal (art collection management and financial management) and external digital resources, regardless of format, through a single interface.  The ILS must be able to import and export needed data in the internal systems without corruption or loss.  Three databases (main library catalog, slide library, and photo archives) reside on the existing VTLS Classic which the contractor must migrate to the new ILS.  Software must be commercially available and configurable for the Gallery's needs.  The contractor must provide the commercial ILS, engineering analysis, system design and security, configuration and customization, data migration, initial training, acceptance testing, in addition to software maintenance and support extending over a period of 12 months with options to extend software maintenance and support for a maximum of 48 months.  The goal is to have a fully operational system no later than the fall of 2002.  Offerors must demonstrate experience in providing ILS for libraries of the size and complexity stated above that have at least 50 full-time staff and one hundred concurrent users.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), plans to start a Public Private Partnering (PPP) program to exploit the dual- use benefits of Nanotechnology.  Under this initiative a Manufacturing  Research, Development and Education (RDE) Center is being envisioned to  address anticipated challenges to field nanotechnolgy and nanostructured  materials with respect to their producibility, characterization and transition  to both existing and future munitions.  A major objective of PPP is to  encourage and formulate partnerships with academia and small businesses to  establish joint programs on a variety of subjects related to manufacturing  science and technology of nanometal powders, advanced energetics, advanced  warheads/armament components, devices and dual use applications.  The  proposed RDE Center will encompass several prototype pilot plants designed to  enable the development of manufacturing and synthesis technologies for a  variety of nanometal powders, passivation and safe handling of highly reactive  powders, mixing of nanopowders and consolidation and processing of fully dense nanostructured components.  These prototype pilot plants will support Army  programs and provide the assets at Picatinny Arsenal to be used as the basis for additional Public Private Partnerships.  Additional facilities will be  established to provide an effective means to expedite the transfer of  incubating academic research and novel and innovative technologies from small  business to both military and commercial applications.  Finally, the RDE  Center will be fully supported by a well-equipped state-of-the-art  nanomaterial characterization facility.  Through this Broad Agency  Announcement (BAA), the Government is soliciting proposals addressing the following thrust areas:    1)Scaleable, cost effective high rate fabrication technologies for nanometal powders, nano-composite powders and nano-structured energetics. 2)Process modeling initiatives associated with high rate fabrication technologies. 3) Alternate passivation approaches for safe  handling of highly reactive nanometal powders. 4) Mixing and separation  (classification) technologies for nano-powders.5) Novel energetic  nanocomposites, light element nanoenergetics, and nanometal enhanced  conventional energetics. 6) Characterization of physical characteristics,  composition, thermal and energetic behavior of nanostructured materials.  7) Consolidation and near net shape forming of nanopowders to nanostructured components.   Small, Small Disadvantaged (SD), and Women-Owned (WO) Business Concerns, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside exclusively for Small, SD, or WO Business Concerns, or for HBCU and MIs.  Offerors interested in submitting a proposal to this BAA should include the name and telephone numbers of technical and business personnel who may be contacted for clarifications and/or authorized to conduct negotiations.  All proposals shall not exceed twenty-five (25) pages.  The  proposals should address the above described thrust requirements, include a  proposed Statement of Work, and describe the engineering/scientific personnel and facilities/equipment available for the proposed effort. Offerors are  strongly urged to submit proposals in digitized format using either (1) a  direct transmission via electronic mail or (2) a 3.5-inch floppy diskette,  zip drive, or compact disk sent via the U.S. Mail or Federal Express.   The cost of preparing proposals in response to this BAA is not considered an  allowable direct charge to any other contract.  BASIS FOR AWARD:  The deadline for proposals will be close of business May 24, 2002.  The proposals will then be rated and ranked by a technical evaluation team.  The Government  representatives will then decide which proposals will receive funding and  those contractors will be contacted.  Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria, listed in descending order of relative importance:   (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposed work;  (2) the relevance and potential of the technology for dual-use (i.e., defense and commercial) applications; (3) Program leveraging in the form of in-kind  contributions, industry and/or defense-supported research programs, etc.;  (4) the extent to which the proposed efforts will be performed at TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey; (5) the technical qualifications and  demonstrated experience of key personnel proposed to perform the technical  efforts; (6) the adequacy of current or planned facilities and equipment to  support projects such as those proposed; and (7) the reasonableness and  realism of the proposed costs.  Although these criteria are listed according  to importance, cost is a significant factor.  Expected contract awards will  generally be made for 3 years to include option years.   The dollar value of  contract awards under this BAA is approximately $100,000 to $150,000 per year  for selected proposals.  Funding for option years will be dependent upon the  availability of funds.  There will be no formal Request For Proposal (RFP)  or other Solicitation issued with regards to this announcement. This BAA is  the solicitation and constitutes as the ONLY solicitation notice for which  proposals are being requested. All changes to the BAA will be sent  electronically to the Commerce Business Daily as amendments. Further, the  Government reserves the right to make either no award or more than one award. Any resulting contract award will contain appropriate FAR and DOD FAR  Supplement clauses (and any implementations thereof) that are applicable for the type of contract contemplated.  The contractor will be required to  submit “Certifications and Representations”.  Data and reporting requirements will be negotiated with the firm(s) selected for contract(s).  The type of  contract contemplated is Firm-Fixed Price (unless another contract type is determined by the contracting officer to be more appropriate).   All proposal  submissions to this BAA solicitation (including contractual and technical/non- technical questions) shall be sent to: US Army TACOM-ARDEC, ATTN:  Mrs. Magda  Szymanski, AMSTA-AQ-APH, Bldg 9, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-5000,  E-MAIL: mszyman@pica.army.mil, Phone No. 973-724-3066, FAX No. 973-724-5484  or 3942.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The  purpose of this Request for Solicitation is to assemble a collection of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and Campylobacter representing a geographically distinct historical collection.   Approximately 1000 isolates of each genus will be analyzed.  The isolates shall be representative of the United States over the time frame being considered.  The information on the health status of the patient, from which the isolate was acquired, as well as drug use history, shall be provided where available.  The contractor may subcontract portions of the work to third parties provided The Center for Veterinarian Medcine?s (CVM) requirements are not jeopardized.  All isolates enrolled in the study will be made available to the CVM Office of Research for genetic analysis to estimate genetic relatedness.  The prospective contractor shall be required to generate nationally representative susceptibility data on selected bacteria collected over the past 5 decades.   This will be accomplished by identifying culture collections from around the US that have the appropriate demographic data.  These organisms will be human and animal clinical isolates.  The collection will be subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using a broth microdilution method consistent with NCCLS standards. Relate the antibiograms of the isolates tested to the antimicrobial agent approval and use patterns in both human and food animal medicine.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB), plans to procure a BD Biosciences FACSVantage SE cell sorter with Digital Vantage (DiVa) digital data acquisition system from Becton Dickinson Biosciences, Inc., 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA  95131. The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The NCI ETIB Flow Cytometry Core Facility provides essential optical biology services to the Branch and to other investigators in the NCI and NIH.  The core is committed to maintaining an up-to-date array of instrumentation for its investigators. The core currently possesses a 1998 BD Biosciences FACSVantage SE cell sorter for physical separation of a wide variety of cell types required by our investigators.  This instrument receives heavy use by both Branch and outside investigators.  NCI has the opportunity to upgrade this instrument in two significant ways: 1st, through conversion of the instrument to full digital acquisition electronics (the Digital Vantage, or DiVa), and 2nd, through the addition of four additional fluorescent detectors, bring our simultaneous fluorescent probe analysis capability from 6 to 12.  The first upgrade shall enhance both the analysis and sorting speed of our instrument, and allow NCI to sort up to four subpopulations simultaneously (up from our current two).  The second upgrade shall increase both the number of fluorochromes NCI can analyze simultaneously, and the flexibility with which NCI can design complex fluorescent experiments.  The BD Biosciences DiVa and 12-color optical bench upgrades will substantially enhance the flow cytometric analysis capabilities of NCI and NIH scientists, both within the ETI Branch and the CCR/NCI.  NCI believes there are no other instruments on the market that can match its complete conversion to digital data acquisition and sorting control or its number of available fluorescent detectors (up to twelve).  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on May 21, 2002.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No faxed copies of capability statements will be accepted.  Interested parties are required to mail one (1) original and two (2) copies of the capability statements to the following address:  Malinda Holdcraft, NIH/NCI/RCB, 6120 Executive Blvd. Suite 6072, Rockville, Maryland 20852-7194.

1.  Can our organization coordinate the offers of our members as far as price and technical approach prior to each member sending in an individual offer?  Are group bids acceptable?  Answer:  No. This is a Solicitation for individual offers.  It is neither a purchase order, nor a sole source contract.  Collusion in bidding on Government contracts is illegal.  One must keep this fact in mind for all agent client interactions. In fact, each offer must be accompanied by a Certificate of Independent Price Determination stating that you have not conferred with any other offeror in establishing your price.
Bids will be accepted from vessel owners for single vessels or from vessel associations.  Vessel association offers will be treated as an individual offer coming from that association and not from the individual vessels it represents.  If that association cannot meet all the criteria of this Solicitation, each vessel included in that offer will be ineligible for an award.
2.  What is the status of plans for the Atlantic Sea Turtle Survivability/Mortality Study?  Answer:  The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) research plan for this study is being documented and will be made available in calendar year 2002.  This study will be conducted separately from the experimental design for this Solicitation.
3. Are hook timers available for the 2002 research program?  Answer:  No.  They are not part of the experimental design for this solicitation.
4.  Is the sea turtle take from the ESA Section 10 Permit being used to conduct any other research? Answer: No.
5.  Is the Solicitation a draft document, and is the deadline subject to change?  Answer:  No, this is not a draft solicitation.  The proposal submission date is extended to May 22, 2002.
6.  Please provide information concerning Federal Acquisition Regulations.  Answer:  See website www.arnet.gov.
7.  What is fixed guarantee Basis?  Answer:  You bid on a fixed unit, in this case each set of 900 hooks.  If you are in complete compliance with all specifications in doing so, you are guaranteed the price stated in your contract for each set successfully completed.(see item below)
The 900 hook set is a compensation unit only and the technical issue is explained below.  
8.  Can individual vessels vary from the 900 hook set?  Answer:  Yes, the 900 hook set is a technical goal and pricing guide.  Individual vessels must meet all safety guidelines in determining the actual number of hooks in each set.
9.  Please explain what each of the contract references and provisions mean and what is required to adequately respond to this solicitation.  What exactly is an Offeror supposed to submit?  Answer:  Submit a Statement of Work, that complies with all specifications in; the Solicitation, the Proposed Experimental Design and Specifications, and the referenced FAR Sections. State exactly what you will do, how you intend to comply and conduct the proposed research effort.  Attach all documentation as necessary to support your contention, and all documents required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.		
Questions regrading the Experimental Design and Specifications
10.  Please clarify Vessels must make at least two trips, fishing 33 experimental sets with a minimum number of 900 hooks, following the specified research protocol.  Answer:  Compensation will be on a fixed guarantee basis for each virtual set of 900 hooks, and will be provided through the invoice process at the completion of each trip.  Each contractor agrees to attempt to complete 33 virtual sets throughout the season.
11.  How will a vessel be compensated if it only completes one trip then encounters a major breakdown and/or other crisis?  Answer: This will be considered on a case by case basis.  A consideration will be made for work successfully completed.
12.  Are all vessel operators required to initialize haul back with an end-haul target goal of 10:00 am?  Answer:  No.  The research design assumes a distribution of haul-back times within the target window of 10 am to 1 pm.
13.  Can foreign vessels apply for this contract?  Answer:  Vessels registered in any North American Free Trade Agreement country may apply; this includes Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
14.  Will the Exempted Fishing Permit also cover other research sampling that Government sponsored scientists have requested?
Answer:  No, each scientist must request an Exempted Fishing Permit from the NMFS for his or her own research interests.
15.  Will the Government designate specific ports for the acquisition?
Answer:  Yes, the Government intends to limit the number of ports. The locations will be selected based on the operating ports of successful offerors.
16.  Will there be flexibility in the workshop date?  Answer:  Yes, the workshop will be held at a central location and the date will be determined as soon as possible.  The Government will work with the contractors to avoid economic hardship.
17.  Is the vessel required to provide the infrastructure for the satellite phone?  Answer:  Yes, the Observer will provide a satellite phone, and the vessel will provide power, access to appropriate location for transmittal, safe storage, etc.  The Vessel Operator is responsible to insure that all communication is working prior to departure.
18.  Who has the responsibility for handling the turtles?  Answer:  
Observers have the authority, the Vessel Operator has the responsibility. The Workshop will contain discussions on this topic so that everyone understands their role in conducting the necessary operations for a successful experiment.		
19.  What is the Termination for Convenience clause?  Answer:  The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate the contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the Government's interest. If the contract is terminated, the rights, duties, and obligations of the parties, including compensation to the Contractor, shall be in accordance with Part 49 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. 
20.  Are draft daily observer reports available to the contractor?
Answer:  No, but the final observer reports for each trip will be made available.  This final report is the only official record of each trip.
21.  Is carrying sufficient bait to make at least 15 sets per trip rather than 20 acceptable?  Answer:  Yes, a minimum of bait for 15 sets is acceptable.

22.  Is the requirement of a minimum of one head and one shower shall be available mandatory?  Answer:  Yes. 
23.  Will the Government provide a complete checklist of equipment necessary for this contract?  Answer:  Yes, a checklist will be presented at the workshop.
24.  Is the Vessel Operator solely responsible for all vessel operations; including safety, navigation, fishing, mechanics and response to weather, as well as all other factors outside the research protocol?  Answer:  Yes, as long as all actions do not conflict with the experimental design.
25.  What is the function of the Trip Summary Report?  Answer:  The Report is required to provide the Government with information needed to assess the feasibility of regulatory changes designed to reduce turtle interactions.  It is to the benefit of fishery participants that new regulations be designed so as to minimize negative impacts.
26.  Can the minimum layover in port of up to six days be changed to a maximum goal of three days?  Answer:  No, individual circumstances dictate that the Government have as much flexibility as possible. NMFS will work with the individual Captains to make as quick a layover as possible.  Six days is not a hard minimum, it up to 6 days.
27.  Can the Vessel Operator designate an observer liaison?  Answer:  
Yes, but the Vessel Operator is ultimately responsible for meeting the requirements in the contract.
28.  Must the vessel have a current Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Examination decal?  Answer:  Yes, all National and State/Province safety examinations must be current.
29.  Will NMFS consider the contract period of performance past 33 sets if the Section 10 takes have not been exhausted?  Answer:  Perhaps, but no additional Government funding or legal liability will be incurred.
30.  Will the Government consider extenuating circumstances should excessive catch situations arise?  Answer:  Yes, on a case by case basis, but no advance changes will be authorized.
31.  Is the Government prepared to dictate exact fishing procedure required to fish successfully and reduce turtle take and mortality?
Answer:  The Government goal is to minimize the take of sea turtles, at the same time minimizing the impacts upon the fishing community.  In order to accommodate this goal, active and intelligent participation of individual Vessel Operators is required to insure that a set of best practices can be developed.  The Government cares about the result.  The methodology is open to flexible development.
32.  Is the vessel required to provide email, satellite phone (SAT PHONE) and radio capabilities?  Answer:  Yes, the observer is required to report at least once every 24 hours once fishing begins.  Each vessel is required to provide the observer
access to working email communications hardware and software with capabilities to send and receive messages to the Government. Observers will provide a SAT PHONE, and the vessel will provide power for SAT PHONE maintenance, access to appropriate location for transmittal, safe storage, etc.  The SAT PHONE will be for government use only.  The vessel's single side band radio will be made accessible to the observer as necessary.  All three communication requirements are to be in working order prior to departure from port. Vessel Operators will aid in relaying messages to and from other contractors in the event of communications problems with any one vessel.

<DESC>DARPA INITIATIVE IN TITANIUM, SOL BAA01-42, Addendum 9, DUE 061002, POC: DR. LEO CHRISTODOULOU, DARPA/DSO, Fax: (571) 218-4553, Email: dsobaa01-42@darpa.mil URL: www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso.  PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in receiving proposals for research, development and establishment of an industrially scalable processing capability for new production and processing methodologies for titanium metal and its alloys.  The overall goals of this program are 1) the establishment of a US-based, high volume, low cost, environmentally benign production capability enabling widespread use of titanium and its alloys and 2) the development and demonstration of unique, previously unattainable titanium alloys, microstructures and properties that enable new high performance applications.  The program will be divided into three phases.  Phase I (no longer than 18 months) has the specific objective of the establishment of a reproducible titanium alloy "sponge" production process at an initial minimum rate of 50 lb/day with the following characteristics; a) oxygen control to 300 (+/- 50) ppm, b) demonstration of uniformity in microstructure (grain size to be within a factor of 5 across cross-section of primary billet); c) demonstration of uniformity of distribution of light (e.g., Al) and heavy (e.g., Mo) elements in titanium alloys; and d) demonstration of a melt-free primary billet.  Phase II (up to 24 months) should address technical issues critical to, and demonstrate the production capability to produce titanium alloy sponge at a minimum rate of 500 lb/day, while meeting or exceeding all purity and uniformity goals for Phase I.  The goal at the end of Phase II is the establishment of a non-melt titanium alloy production capability and a maximum cost of primary commercial purity (CP) titanium billet (material suitable for subsequent processing by forging, extrusion, rolling etc, into useful product forms) of $4.00/lb.  Phase III (12 months) should establish a functioning pilot scale plant for production of titanium alloy sponge and a demonstrated capability for non-melt processed alloy/product forms (e.g., Ti-6Al-4V forgings) with properties equivalent to those of traditionally processed alloys of identical composition.  This phase should conclude with the demonstration of at least one new composition chemistry alloy product. The following are considered desirable in the program: a) processes and approaches that are conducive to low-cost flexible processing/fabrication; b) environmentally benign processes and c) integrated, multidisciplinary, collaborative efforts or teaming arrangements among industry, universities, federal laboratories, and users.  PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Each proposal should 1) include a plausible business plan, including a clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and specific cost targets for titanium "sponge," CP titanium and titanium alloy billet; 2) explicitly describe processes and approaches for the development of new low-cost titanium alloy compositions/microstructures/properties; 3) describe the approach to demonstrate non-melt derived billet products; 4) describe the approach to demonstrate "solute segregation-free" alloys; 5) describe the approach to demonstrate process scale-up; 6) describe the approach to demonstrate CP titanium metal and alloys with controlled impurities including oxygen and other interstitials and halides; and 7) include a risk mitigation strategy. Proposals should be phased.  Phase I should not exceed eighteen (18) months, with Phase II and Phase III not exceeding twenty-four (24) and twelve (12) months, respectively.  However, the total of all three phases should be no longer than 48 months.  All objectives are considered "go"/"no-go" milestones.  If multiple awards are made downselection may occur at the end of each Phase.  Cost sharing is not an evaluation criterion.  Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal.  The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds.  Full proposals shall consist of two volumes: technical and cost.  Offerors should submit one (1) original and six (6) copies of the full proposal due no later than 1600 ET June 10, 2002, to the address shown below.  Volume 1: Technical.  The technical volume for this addendum is limited to a maximum of 30 pages, including all figures, references, tables, charts, and appendices.  The technical proposal shall include the following: 1) an executive summary (two pages or less); 2) a technical approach section outlining key development milestones; 3) a plan for the establishment of the production, processing and fabrication capability and for performance demonstration to include risk mitigation steps; 4) a plausible business plan and specific cost targets for the various materials of interest identified above 5) a clear statement of work and a time-phased schedule-milestone chart; 6) organizational structure of the team and management approach; 7) summary of relevant prior work and experience; 8) description of and intentions for handling intellectual property; 9) brief description of applicable expertise, facilities and equipment; and 10)  brief resumes of key individuals. Volume 2: Cost.  The cost volume shall conform to the guidelines in the original announcement for BAA01-42 dated September 4, 2001.  EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS: Evaluation of the proposals will be based on the following criteria, in decreasing order of importance:  1) the scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort as they address the program requirements listed above; 2) the likelihood that the proposed development will provide unique and/or new capabilities for the production of titanium and its alloys of interest to DoD including intellectual property arrangements and specific cost targets; 3) the qualifications of the principal investigator and other key personnel, and adequacy of the equipment and facilities to meet the objectives; and 4) cost realism.  Proposers may be asked to present their proposal in person to an evaluation committee.  A formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  Evaluation and selection of proposals for award will be made to those offerors whose proposal is considered most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Technology Investment Agreement (TIA)," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  The offeror must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227).  Holders of Intellectual Property (IP) are strongly encouraged to permit/sanction multiple proposals based on their IP in order to permit multiple technology exploitation options.  Multiple awards based on the same technology may be made.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit proposals that will be evaluated if received in the correct format by the closing date.  Because of the specific nature of this solicitation, no portion of this will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation.  However, these organizations are encouraged to apply and/or team with other proposers.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  In all correspondence, reference BAA01-42, Addendum 9.  Proposals will not be returned.  All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence.  Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor.  All support contractors are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as "GOVERNMENT ONLY."  For general administrative questions and proposal formatting, please refer to the original CBD announcement for BAA01-42 dated September 4, 2001.  ADDRESS FOR SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS: DARPA/DSO, Attn: BAA01-42, Addendum 9, 3701 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) plans to award a sole source  contract to Lockheed Martin Management and Data Systems (LMM&DS), P.O. Box 8048, Philadelphia, PA 19101 for technical services to provide software enhancement activities for the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS). LMM&DS is the incumbent for engineering and development of the TTWCS.  This contract action will require the incumbent to work in close association with Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWC-DD) to support adaptive enhancements related to the continued evolution of TTWCS capabilities, perfective enhancements to improve software performance, suitability, reliability and maintainability, and corrective changes to fix defects.
      Initial TTWCS system level requirements included compliance with the Joint Technical Architecture, hardware-software independence, and for the TTWCS, to be expandable and extensible LMM&DS has independently developed core proprietary data that is necessary and essential for the enhancement activities of the TTWCS Operating Environment (OE).  The TTWCS Operating Environment supports intra software communications for Common Services and hardware diagnostics and by the use of Architecture Based Design (ABD) tools optimizes system design characteristics.  Detailed knowledge of ABD artifacts and design of the Operating Environment are therefore prerequisites to enable rapid response to correct emergent problems identified by the ships' forces and to support the addition of new system level requirements consistent with the evolutionary growth of software intensive weapon systems.  Additional requirements for this effort include certification within the past 24 months of a Level 3 or higher for software capability maturity using either the Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for software development, or the CMM Integrated for Systems Engineering and Software development.  Accordingly, as the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the TTWCS, Lockheed Martin is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the TTWCS design and system architecture.   Therefore, award to any one other than the incumbent would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.
                The estimated period of performance for this prospective contractual action is 1 year, with 4 one-year options.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>This is a modification issued This is a modification to the combined synopsis/solicitation N00173-02-R-HA02 for an Inductively-Coupled Plasma (ICP), Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition System (PECVD) posted on April 29, 2002.  The modification is issued to correct the solicitation document  to  incorporate provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) #01-07 and to answer questions regarding the original synopsis.  Questions and answers are as follows:

Question #1:	In order to achieve reasonable deposition rates (~80-800 A/min.)  In a High Density deposition system (ICP/PECVD) it is necessary to use 100% silane and not the 5% silane (balanced in nitrogen) called out in the specification.  Is it acceptable to propose a system, which uses 100% silane?

Answer #1:	No

Question #2:	The system produce by our company has electrodes that operate in the following temperature ranges -150C to +400C, +50C to +400C, and +50C to +700C.  
The -150C to 400C electrode requires the use of liquid nitrogen.  Which one is preferred by NRL?

Answer #2:	+50C to 400C range is preferred.

Question #3:	While our company produces a wide range of plasma processing system complete with pumps, heater/chiller units and end point detection instrumentation we do not offer cabinets for the storage of gas bottles.  Each system is provided with a "gas pod" enclosure that houses up to 6 (or 12) MFC's/gas lines, shutoff valves and mixing manifold but that will not support the actual gas bottles themselves.  Is it acceptable to propose a system without the gas cabinets?

Answer #3:	No.

<DESC>NA The Garrison Commander, Fort Hamilton, New York announced on 1 May 2002 its tentative decision to retain in-house the Military Personnel Identification Card Services function. This decision is the result of a competitive process conducted in accordance wit h Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76. The decision to retain the performance of the function in-house was made after a detailed study indicated it was more cost effective to continue to perform the function by Government personnel rather than by  contract. A 30 day public review period commences at the start of business on Thursday, 2 May 2002 and will continue through close of business, Friday, 31 May 2002. Documentation supporting the tentative decision is available for review at Building 111, R oom 217, Fort Hamilton, New York. Due to heightened security measures interested parties should contact Mr. Bruce Gorski at (718)630-4235 or Mr. Andrew Rupert at (718)630-4494 to schedule review. Appeals of the decision should be mailed or delivered to Wil liam E. Campbell, Jr., Contracting officer, 9410 Jackson Loop, Suite 101, Fort Belvoir VA 22060-5134. This tentative decision was originally announced in FEDBIZOPPS on 1 May 2002 via Special Notice USA-SNOTE-020501-0003.

<DESC>Modification:  In the 6th sentence below, the words "any firm" are hereby changed to "any GSA scheduled vendor".  

The U.S. Department of State plans to award a sole source task order to Logistics Management Institute (LMI) under its Corporate Contract Schedule GS-00F-0026M for specialized technical and analytical services concerning  Workforce Planning Models and Methodologies for the Domestic and Overseas Staffing Models (DSM and OSM), and other major modeling and development in the Human Resources areas.   Over the past several months, the Department of State (DOS) has enhanced its ability to do workforce planning by developing analytical methodologies, processes, utilizing inter-related mathematical models that allow resource management analysts to systematically estimate Department staffing and readiness requirements for Foreign Service officers; estimate domestic staffing requirements for Foreign Service, civil service, contractor, and part-time, intermittent & temporary employees; and estimate Foreign Service promotion opportunities by simulating career flows, attrition, and ensuing personnel inventories that result from a set of Foreign Service HR policies.  Maintenance and enhancements of the models are also required to incorporate changes in personnel policies and directives.  LMI is the incumbent for development of the DSM and OSM.   LMI is uniquely qualified to continue these services due to their intimate knowledge of the project and expertise in Federal workforce planning and modeling.    No solicitation is available, and this notice is not a request for competitive quotes; however, any GSA scheduled vendor that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within fifteen days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement.  Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist, US Department of State, Office of Acquisition, P.O. Box 9115, Rosslyn Station, Arlington, VA  22219  (see Point of Contact below).   Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the Department of State will proceed with the sole source negotiation with LMI.

THE ORIGINAL SOLICITATION THAT WAS POSTED ON MAY 2, 2002, SHOULD BE DISCARDED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number is AER90901000 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-06.  FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be used.  NAICS code is 541922, Commercial Photography, with a size standard of $5M applies to this 100% small business set-aside. The Job Corps is a training program for youth ages 16 to 24 at time of enrollment. It is primarily residential with some non-residential components. The program provides free educational and vocational training, free housing in dormitories, work experience, counseling, basic health care and other support services. The mission of the program is to attract eligible young adults, teach them the skills they need to become employable and independent, and to place them in meaningful jobs, further education, or military service. Ultimately, the training should enable the students to become self-sufficient members of society who contribute to the community as taxpayers and good citizens. Job Corps intends to award a one-time purchase order for the services identified herein. Job Corps Region VI - Seattle seeks a contractor to photograph students, staff, and facilities at the following 11 Job Corps Center (JCC) sites: 1) Angell JCC, 335 N.E.

Our goal is to acquire a library of full color quality photographs from each site, and our intent is to use these photos for a wide variety of media needs including brochures, the Regional web site, pre-movie "slide" advertising, point of purchase advertising displays, etc.  The chosen contractor will 1) Be a professional photographer with five or more years' experience with photographing people, events, and facilities; 2)Work with Regional Office contact to establish a shooting schedule no later than one week after contract is awarded; 3) Work with a Job Corps designated contact person at each Job Corps site during the photo sessions; 4) Work from a checklist of required subject matter for photos. These photos will capture Job Corps students participating in academic classes, vocational training, recreational events (e.g. basketball or pool) and in residential areas. Most shots will be fairly close up and will focus on one or two individuals engaged in an activity rather than large groups. Photos should also capture exteriors of some key buildings at each Center. It is estimated that 80% of photos taken will have people as the subject, with 20% of the photos being of facilities. It is also estimated that half of the photos will be taken indoors (e.g. dorm rooms, classrooms) while half will be taken outdoors (e.g. vocational work sites, basketball court); 5) Spend no more than one eight hour day at each site, and may spend longer than that only with the prior writtenapproval of the Contracting Officer; 6) Work with the Job Corps Center contact person to ensure that all persons photographed sign releases.

<SOLNBR>0102RP85139
<RESPDATE>052902
<ARCHDATE>06292002
<CONTACT>Anna DeGurse, Contract Specialist, fax 703-787-1387, email anna.degurse@mms.gov
<DESC>The United States (U. S.) Government, and specifically, the Minerals Management Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  This acquisition is 100% set aside for small businesses.  All offerors must be able to qualify under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) subsector 5416.  Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994, gave the MMS the authority to convey, on a noncompetitive basis, the rights to OCS sand, gravel, or shell resources for shore protection, beach or wetlands restoration projects, or for use in construction projects funded in whole or part or authorized by the Federal Government.  Since enactment of PL 103-426, MMS has provided Federal sand for beach nourishment projects in New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana.  In many of the areas in which Federal sand is presently being used or for areas where the use of Federal sand for beach nourishment material is being considered, or in areas where coarse sand and gravel deposits are known to exist and may be potential sources of construction aggregate, submerged archaeological properties may also be present.  These properties could consist of drowned prehistoric or historic terrestrial sites or historic shipwrecks. In the case of shipwrecks, some of them are considered significant under criteria established for the National Register of Historic Places, others are not.  Whether the wrecks are historic in nature or not however, shipwrecks and jetties are a focal point for certain fish and are now considered potential Essential Fisheries Habitat by the National Marine Fisheries Service, especially if these structures are the only hard habitat for miles around.  Shipwreck sites are also used extensively by sport divers, recreational fishermen, and commercial fishermen. Offshore dredging has been known to result in the burial of wrecks by as much as 10 feet of sand and recovery is unlikely given the replenishment schedules and reuse of many borrow areas over a period of time. There have also been recent instances of shipwreck and historic artifact damage caused as a result of offshore dredging operations.  Because of the potential for damage to important offshore archaeological resources, MMS intends to award a contract to examine the efficacy of the present buffer zones allocated for archaeological sites and their ability to protect archaeological resources. In addition, there is a need to examine the adequacy of current MMS requirements for archaeological surveys relative to the identification and mapping of archaeological properties within sand lease areas, given the scale and complexity of a typical beach dredging or offshore construction aggregate operation.  SCOPE OF WORK: The Contractor will be required to review current MMS practices and procedures for the protection of submerged prehistoric and historic sites and shipwrecks during offshore dredging operations and to provide a plan and proposed specifications by which the MMS can ensure that significant drowned prehistoric and historic sites and shipwrecks that exist within potential Federal OCS sand borrow areas or aggregate areas are not adversely impacted by offshore dredging operations. This work will entail: a worldwide search of the existing literature base relative to submerged prehistoric or historic site and shipwreck damage or disturbance resulting from offshore dredging operations; a technological and engineering review of current dredging practices and procedures for the various types of dredges used in beach nourishment and construction aggregate dredging; a worldwide review of current practices and procedures to mitigate against adverse impacts to submerged prehistoric or historic sites, known shipwrecks, and possible shipwreck sites during offshore dredging operations; a review and analysis of the current MMS specifications for archaeological surveys in advance of offshore dredging operations proposed for the Federal waters; and a review of current MMS procedures for protecting submerged prehistoric or historic sites, known shipwrecks, and possible shipwreck sites during offshore operations. A final scientific/technical manuscript/report will be required to be delivered. The period of performance of the resultant contract will be twenty (20) months with a cost range of $115,000 to $125,000. A scientific paper for publication in a refereed journal, as well as presentation of the study results at a scientific conference are required.  In order to compete for this contract, an offeror must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than COB May 29, 2002, a Capabilities Statement describing in detail:(A)The scientific personnel who would be responsible for the collection, interpretation and synthesis of information; (B) The organization's expertise with this type of work and a description of your facilities and resources; and (C) Specific references (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that your organization or personnel are currently performing or have completed within the last three (3) years.  REFERENCES WILL BE CHECKED. Offerors shall submit their Capabilities Statement in original and four (4) copies to Anna DeGurse , Contracting Officer, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2500, Herndon Virginia 20170-4817.  Time of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon, Virginia.  Your Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on: (A) Experience and expertise of all technical Key Personnel. Particularly relevant is their expertise in the field of dredging technology and engineering and marine archaeology or other relevant necessary disciplines to undertake the project, their experience in the type of work proposed, and demonstrated ability to do the work.  Scientific personnel must collectively demonstrate relevant experience in the appropriate disciplines.  This experience must be demonstrated through authorship in peer reviewed publications.  Assessment factors will be their qualifications, the relevance of their qualifications to their assigned task, and their estimated level of effort; the technical personnel who will be responsible for the organization of information and the production of documents and manuscripts will also be evaluated.  Evaluation factors include 1. The length and quality of experience for each person assigned to perform specific tasks, 2. The level and quality of formal education in the disciplines and technical fields necessary, examining the level of relevant education attained as well as, honors, awards, and recognition of previous work. 3.  Experience with similar programs and studies. (B) The Project Manager shall have:  (1) experience and demonstrated leadership ability required for the coordination of the study process, (2) experience in managing a multi-disciplinary team and the interdisciplinary processes required for this study, and (3) ability to control costs and to keep project performance and document preparation on schedule; and (C)Your organization's history of (1) successful completion of similar projects (similar in size, scope, complexity, duration, and dollar value), (2) producing high-quality documents, and (3) conducting similar projects on schedule and within budget. Questions should be faxed to Anna DeGurse at (703) 787-1387 or e-mailed to anna.degurse@mms.gov.  All correspondence should include the RFP number, your full name/company name, address and phone and fax numbers.  Requests or questions by telephone are strongly discouraged.

The amendment will provide responses to questions from potential offerors and make changes to Sections L and M of the solicitation.  One of the changes will be to implement USAID Acquisition and Assistance Policy Directive 02-06, Source Selection and Evaluating Past Performance in Using Small Business Concerns.  This policy is available from the USAID web site:  http://www.usaid.gov/procurement_bus_opp/procurement/cib/ .  Although mandatory for solicitations issued May 1, 2002 and after, the Contracting Officer has determined that it may be applied to this solicitation.  The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet. (By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5 floppy disk (Microsoft 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy). You must confirm in writing to the contact person noted below that, you have received the solicitation (when posted) through the Internet. As the recipient of the solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from INTERNET in its entirety. USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you download the solicitation at FBO. Generally, the Contracting Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt. However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet. You are therefore advised to regularly check the FBO Internet site for amendment. NAICS: 541611 Order of Magnitude Threshold: (Estimated) NTE $35 million, Competition Level: Full and Open and Numbered/Non-Numbered Notes do not apply.

<DESC>Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) aids U.S. businesses of all sizes to invest and compete in more than 140 emerging markets and developing nations worldwide.  OPIC is a Federal agency of the U.S. Government.   OPIC?s Department of Legal Affairs is charged with providing the agency with high-quality legal representation and advice in the most practical, efficient, and cost-effective manner. To assist it in discharging these responsibilities, OPIC?s Department of Legal Affairs engages, from time to time, outside counsel.  A description of our mission and programs is found in the OPIC Program Handbook, a copy of which can be obtained from OPIC?s website at http://www.opic.gov.

OPIC contemplates the award of Basic Agreements to qualified legal firms on a competitive basis. Award of a Basic Agreement does not guarantee award of a contract, which would be the basis for performance of services.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to seek industry comments and inputs concerning the operation of a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Facility.   The EOSDIS Alaska SAR Facility (ASF) is required to acquire, process, archive and distribute very large volumes (estimated to reach at least 60 Terabytes/year) of remote sensed SAR data to research scientists, governmental entities and the public that apply this physical information to understand and solve major problems in the Earth Sciences, such as global change, environmental monitoring, agricultural inventory, geology, hydrology, ice sheet movements, polar change detection, etc. The ESDIS Project is interested in awarding or renewing a contract for acquiring and archiving SAR data at a facility that would work cooperatively with the ESDIS Science Operations Office (SOO) and the Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs).  The functions of the SAR facility would include, but are not limited to:  1) Direct interaction with universities or research institutes that use SAR data. 2) Direct Data reception and capture from SAR satellites. 3) Direct ingest of raw signal data from US or foreign ground stations.  Site must be capable of ingesting digital tapes from foreign ground stations. 4) Automated processing of raw signal SAR data to Level-0 data  5) Automatic archiving of Level-0 data to on-line storage facility. 6) Capable of archiving 350 Terabytes of data electronically and on site. 7) Capable of processing Level-0 products to Level-1 or higher. 8) Capable of calibrating data to specifications and geo-location.  Required for global change research. 9) Capable of distributing data to NASA customers using commercial shipping. 10) Act as the US Order Desk for all NASA's foreign partners (CSA, ESA, NASDA). 11) Provide science expertise to formulate new projects and missions. 12) Operate the User Service Office to assist customers in their daily needs. 13) Receive product price list from DAACs (and at least annual updates),  14) Allow ASF users to establish accounts 15) Respond to user queries concerning account or order payment status,  16) Provide regular activity reports.  17) Interact with the Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) Alliance and NASA Headquarters. 18) Strong understanding of the SAR science community goals and mission set.  The SAR science community frequently collaborates with federal agencies, private industries and educational institutions to understand and research global change phenomena.   19) Fully staffed with trained engineers and operators Geographic Constraints: 1) The SAR facility must be at or above Latitude 64°N and within the United States of America.  The rational for the northern latitude is to allow the maximum number of opportunities to acquire data from polar orbiting spacecraft.  For example:  10 to 12 passes for Radarsat-1, 3-5 passes for ERS-2, and 12-14 passes for ADEOS-2. 2) This facility should be resident at or have a strong partnership with a university to encourage education outreach, academic involvement and scientific research. Infrastructure Constraints: 1) Site must posses X-band antennas for the reception of high data rate SAR data. 2) The data archive and ground reception equipment must already exist and be collocated with a Data Archive Center to provide the most convenient and efficient method of capturing and archiving the data.   3) The facility should already exist and require little modification. 4) High-speed data networks and communication systems should already be in place and available for use. Management Constraints: 1) Management and personnel should already be familiar with managing data acquisition, processing, archiving, calibration and distribution of SAR data from multiple satellite systems. 2) Institution will be responsible for the U.S. Order desk for the scheduling and acquisition of SAR data for the NASA science user. 3) Management must have experience coordinating and conducting operations with NASA and foreign agencies. For an understanding of the scope of operation of the ASF respondents should review the provided references. These documents serve as a backdrop against which respondents must frame and pose the appropriate advanced information technology topics for further consideration: Reference	URL  1. ASF Website	http://www.asf.alaska.edu/ 2. SAR Facility RFI Website  http://romulus.gsfc.nasa.gov/sarrfi/ 3. Sample Statement of Work http://romulus.gsfc.nasa.gov/sarrfi/sar_documents.html Table 1 In addition, information concerning the EOSDIS DAACs is available on-line at: http://ulabibm.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac/ The ESDIS Project encourages responses from businesses or other groups interested in the opportunity of providing a SAR data facility.  The responses should demonstrate the operational reliability and robustness of the proposed approach, as well as simplicity and straightforwardness for users and the DAACs.  The responses should show how the System could adapt to growth in the user community, changes in systems interfaces, and changes in technology. Sources with information relevant to this request are asked to respond by submitting a white paper of no more than five (5) pages which conforms to Annex 1, "Template For SAR Facility Continuing Operations Submittal". The paper should clearly address a prospective of how to meet current user demands and protect existing archive, acquire current SAR data from operational instruments and prepare for future missions.  The approach should provide a portion or all of the needed capabilities.  Please provide enough costs estimates for any Commercial-Off-the-Shelf products and the effort needed to integrate the proposed SAR facility.  Comments and suggestions for improving the Alaska SAR Facility is always encouraged and solicited.  All information received from this RFI will be combined and used for government procurement planning purposes. Sources are urged to describe their approach in enough detail so that NASA can plan for subsequent proposal opportunities for which proprietary information is appropriate.  The information received in response to this RFI will be reviewed and summarized by a panel of experts. Some or no part of the summarized and synthesized recommendations may or may not form the basis of a future NASA solicitation, such as a NASA RFP (Request for Proposals).  Annex 1 TEMPLATE FOR SAR FACILITY CONTINUING OPERATIONS SUBMITTAL 1.	Background and Description of Proposed Approach 	 Describe in adequate detail the specific approach to implementing the SAR Facility, which is being proposed for ESDIS Project consideration, the current state of its development, how interfaces to DAAC-based systems would be implemented, the comparability of your approach with or its use of current and/or anticipated commercial approaches.  You will want to provide an Operations Concept ("a day in the life" scenario) illustrating the use of your approach. 	 2.	Operational Robustness and Flexibility for Growth and Evolution of Proposed Approach Address the operational reliability and robustness of your proposed approach, as well as simplicity and straightforwardness for science users and the DAACs.  Describe how your approach to providing the system could adapt to growth in the user community, changes in the systems interfaces, and changes in technology. 3.	Science Support for SAR user community Describe specific details how the SAR science community will benefit from the support the SAR facility will provide.  Describe the research organizations available and educational outreach mechanisms in place to assist the SAR science community.   4.     Cost to Operate   Provide a rough estimate of the cost to operate the SAR Facility on an annual basis.  Responses may be sent via electronic mail, regular mail, or fax to: Mr. William J.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a contract for the modernization of the Mission Computer Set (MCS) for the E-6B aircraft in FY04 with a possible acceleration to FY03. The MCS system was incorporated into the E-6B aircraft as part of the ABNCP modification program. MCS is comprised of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) hardware and software components of early 90?s vintage. All of these COTS components are no longer commercially produced and are approaching the end of their supportability. Over the past several years, numerous software upgrades were incorporated in response to emergent fleet requirements and mission system upgrade programs. These upgrades have resulted in the MCS processor approaching the maximum utilization rate, and the system initialization time surpassing tolerable limits in the fleet. In addition, the MCS system is displaying stability problems during fleet operations, significantly reducing fleet readiness levels and leading to a high level of mission degradation. These stability problems require significant system redesign to achieve substantial improvement. This current situation necessitates the need for an MCS modernization program to correct supportability issues, improve system performance and stability, and extend the lifespan of the system to meet its projected service retirement date of 2013 as originally planned. MCS is expected to begin reaching the end of its supportability in FY05. Its supportability will decrease rapidly beyond this date, requiring a significant level of resources to be applied to the COTS OEM?s, where possible, to continue support.  The MCS support effort will assume an increasing risk beyond this point, which is significantly amplified by the mission criticality of the MCS system. While some OEM support may be achievable beyond FY05, the mission criticality of the system and the high level of existing performance deficiencies necessitates the development and subsequent fleet introduction of equipment be undertaken on an aggressive schedule. Several factors impose conditions on the planning and execution of the MCS modernization program.  Installation must start in the FY05/06 timeframe. Performing installations during Enhanced Phased Maintenance (EPM) events will limit the impact to the fleet. Utilizing the EPM cycle for installations will allow completion of the entire fleet in approximately 6 months. This deadline limits the NRE period to approximately 2 years with an early FY04 start. Second, installation time constraints impose limits to the design change of this effort for both the physical space/weight of the new system and the system operation. The change to the existing MCS design in these areas must be limited to reduce impacts to both training and aircraft pub/drawings, thereby reducing the complexity of the installation. Third, it is extremely desirable for this effort to achieve maximum compatibility/commonality with the MCS replacement effort of the Block 1 upgrade program, which will be utilizing COTS products and is on a concurrent NRE development timeframe. MCS is the main automated data processor (ADP) device in the E-6B mission avionics suite and is the sole means of data I/O for all data communications subsystems. It interfaces with all Mission Avionics System (MAS) communications systems, providing message transmission/reception, database storage/retrieval, editing, and an operator graphical user interface. MCS is a COTS based system and is comprised of two main components: the processor and the Generic Front-end Communications Processor (GFCP). The processor runs unique mission application software along with several COTS software applications. The GFCP provides custom interfacing to each of the legacy MAS communications systems. The system uses the UNIX AIX operating system, and the mission application is coded in the ADA programming language. This upgrade consists of replacing all COTS components, both hardware and software, andtransitioning the mission application over to a modern C++ programming language, while maintaining all current MCS operation and functionality.  Both the current GFCP and processor hardware must be replaced.  A new, DIICOE operating system compatible with the hardware components must be selected along with the new COTS software applications. Certification of this effort must be accomplished through DOD accreditation processes. This upgrade also consists of developing a modern, Open Systems Architecture (OSA) based architecture that is compatible with both the OSA network and MCS replacement architecture of the E-6 Block 1 modification program. This architecture should implement as much of the Block 1 modification as possible and should provide a seamless, cost effective transition to the final Block 1 solution. Sources for the modernization program will be limited to Lockheed Martin Undersea Systems (LMUSS). LMUSS is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MCS system and is also the Software Support Activity (SSA) and depot repair activity for this system. As the OEM, LMUSS is the sole designer and manufacturer and has in-depth knowledge and experience with the historical design data, drawings, design principles/concepts, and source code. As the current SSA, LMUSS has performed all software engineering and maintenance since the initial system fielding and, as such, has performed numerous software releases over a seven year period.  LMUSS has also been a member of both the Cryptographic Modification Program (CMP) and the ADWS program teams and performed both software and hardware modifications to the MCS system as part of these efforts. As the current MCS depot repair activity for this system, LMUSS performs all inspection, troubleshooting, and repair of fleet assets and on numerous occasions has developed hardware modifications to resolve adverse problems with this hardware.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is planning to award a contract for the modernization of the Mission Computer Set (MCS) for the E-6B aircraft. The MCS system was incorporated into the E-6B aircraft as part of the ABNCP modification program. MCS is comprised of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) hardware and software components of early 90?s vintage. All of these COTS components are no longer commercially produced, and are approaching the end of their supportability. Over the past several years, numerous software upgrades were incorporated in response to emergent fleet requirements and mission system upgrade programs. These upgrades have resulted in the MCS processor approaching the maximum utilization rate and the system initialization time surpassing tolerable limits in the fleet.  In addition, the MCS system is displaying stability problems during fleet operations, significantly reducing fleet readiness levels and leading to a high level of mission degradation. These stability problems require significant system redesign to achieve substantial improvement. This current situation necessitates the need for an MCS modernization program to correct supportability issues, improve system performance and stability, and extend the lifespan of the system to meet its projected service retirement date of 2013 as originally planned. MCS is expected to begin reaching the end of its supportability in FY05. Its supportability will decrease rapidly beyond this date, requiring a significant level of resources to be applied to the COTS OEM?s, where possible, to continue support. The MCS support effort will assume an increasing risk beyond this point, which is significantly amplified by the mission criticality of the MCS system. While some OEM support may be achievable beyond FY05, the mission criticality of the system and the high level of currently experienced performance deficiencies necessitate the development and subsequent fleet introduction of equipment be undertaken on an aggressive schedule. Several factors impose conditions on the planning and execution of the MCS modernization program. First, the development and aircraft installations must be accomplished by (date or year) very quickly. Installation must start in the FY05/06 timeframe. Performing installations during EPM?s will limit the impact to the fleet. Utilizing the EPM cycle for installations will allow completion of the entire fleet in approximately 6 months. This deadline limits the NRE period to approximately 2 years with an early FY04 start. Second, these installation time constraints impose limits to the design change of this effort for both the physical space/weight of the new system and the system operation. The change to the existing MCS design in these areas must be limited to reduce impacts to both training and aircraft pub/drawings, thereby, reducing the complexity of the installation.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is seeking Louisiana Certified, General Real Property appraisers interested in the following scope of services:
A. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

	The United States is purchasing a permanent easement that allows the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to protect, restore, maintain, manage and monitor the vegetation and hydrology of the land that is ultimately placed under easement.

B. APPRAISER QUALIFICATIONS

	Appraisers shall be Certified General Real Property Appraisers.

C. PURPOSE OF THE APPRAISAL REPORT

	The purpose of the appraisal report is to estimate the fair market or current market agricultural value of a defined tract of land before the NRCS easement encumbers the land use and without regard to speculative development.

D. BACKGROUND FOR THE APPRAISAL REPORT

	The Appraiser is to:

1.  Conduct a market analysis to assure that the highest and best use of the tract of land is agricultural use. Other highest and best uses will not be analyzed or used. Do not consider or include any above ground non-permanently fixed mechanical irrigation equipment. The estimated fair market value will not include water, hunting, fishing or mineral rights;

2.  View all land currently not being tilled because of a TEMPORARY conservation agreement, contract, or easement or restoration of any type, as cropland;

3.  Arrive at an estimate of value based on the current market value of the land for agricultural use only;

4.  Use agricultural values of bare land found in the market place to justify the value given for such soils or cover types and exclude residential, industrial or commercial development uses; appraiser should compare each type of soil in each comparable sale to the subject.

5.  Use comparable sales without residential eligibility. If comparable sales used are eligible for residences, the comparable sales must be appropriately discounted and well documented, when appraising in zoning restricted rural areas where residences are being developed. The estimated value shall be that for land not eligible for residences;

6.  Document properly that the area to be put under easement is to be treated as an independent parcel and not part of the larger ownership. Sales will be selected on this basis, however no adjustments may be needed nor required for differences in size or acres to the parcel and;

7.  Consider irrigation. Irrigation will be included in the determination of agriculture value where irrigation is a factor in agricultural use unless NRCS, for a specific easement, requests that the value be based only on dry land agriculture use.

8.  For sites, soils, or cover types (e.g., woodland and emergent wetland potholes) that do not produce agricultural commodities, the value assigned shall be the typical value found in the market for such soils or cover types excluding residential, industrial, or commercial development uses. Woodlands  shall be considered as bare land (cut-over) found in the market place.

9.  It is not the intent of the agency to purchase crop bases, if possible. Unless there is no remaining land on the farm, the landowner should move the base to a non-easement area on the farm. If there is no remaining land on the farm that is adaptable for use of the base, then that crop base value will be included in the appraisal. Supporting documentation of production data is required.

	NRCS officials will provide the following to the appraiser:

1.  Aerial photograph of the farm with the location of the proposed easement area identified and an estimate of the acres in the proposed easement;

2.  Approximate legal description of the easement area (survey to be completed later); Example: On attached aerial photograph approximately 10.5 (outlined in dark ink) acres located in the NW 1/4. NW 1/4 of Section 10 T55N R20W of 5th PM;

3.  Township plat map with farm location identified;

4.  County map showing the location ofthe farm in the county; and

5.  Aerial photograph indicating the location and acreage of any TEMPORARY conservation agreement, contract, or easement or restoration of any type that is to be valued as cropland (i.e., because the area is eligible to return to cropland it will be valued as cropland).

6.  Information on easement acres with cropbase, documentation of production data required.

E.  THE APPRAISAL REPORT

1.  A standard narrative appraisal or form report will be provided. This shall be completely filled out, with all points addressed. The appraisal report must follow the guidelines issued in the current copy of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP) and may be a limited summary type report. The Appraiser may invoke the following USPAP departure provisions for the following reasons:

--Standard Rules 1-2(c) and (d); because the purpose of the appraisal is to estimate the market value of the agricultural land without regard to limited access, due to location of the easement tract etc., within the farm. The value estimate requested for purposes of WRP is without consideration of the items listed in 1-2(c).

--Standard Rule 1-2(e), Standard Rules 1-4(f) and (h); because the property is considered to be bare land without improvement or fixtures.

--Standard Rules 1-3(a), (b) and Standard Rule 1-4(g); because the appraiser has relied upon the client?s knowledge of the neighborhood?s real estate and current market conditions and the constraints of the Wetlands Reserve Program. Agricultural use if the only highest and best use consideration. The purpose of the appraisal is to estimate the value of the tract before an easement encumbers land use and without regard to speculative development.

--Standard Rules 1-4(d) and (e); because the client requested a value as if fee simple estate was to be given.

2.  Direct sales comparisons must be supported with sufficient documentation along with photographs to be properly understood and to lead the reader to the same conclusions.

3.  Because of the specified highest and best use (Agricultural Use), any other limiting conditions or other departure provisions from USPAP must be fully documented.

					


F. EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE APPRAISAL REPORT

	The effective date of the Appraisal Report is the date the property was personally inspected by the appraiser.

G. CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF THE APPRAISAL REPORT

1.  The confidentiality provisions of USPAP will be followed.

2.  Appraiser?s valuation and supporting reports are confidential information and appraisers shall not divulge their findings and opinions to anyone except authorized officials of the U.S. Government.

3.  Any report prepared for the purpose of the U.S. acquisition shall be construed to be the subject of potential litigation until the time that the U.S. Government has completed acquisition of the easement area.

4.  Consistent with Department of Justice policy, content of reports shall not be discussed without express authorization of NRCS.

In summary, NRCS is interested in the agricultural value only.  This service is 100% set-aside for small businesses.This is a sources sought announcement only.  It is not a request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract.
Please send your response via email or fax.

<SUBJECT>L -- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY (P&A) AGENCIES
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems (NAPAS) to provide specialized technical assistance to the 57 designated State and U.S. Territorial Protection and Advocacy  (P&A) agencies.  SSA intends to award a contract to NAPAS to provide technical assistance and training to State P&As to help them in their role as authorized by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (TWWIIA).  The purpose of the project is to provide P&As with the assistance necessary to enable them to provide protection and advocacy services which beneficiaries with disabilities may need to secure or regain gainful employment.  NAPAS is the only known source that can provide all of the requirements described below.  BACKGROUND:  The TWWIIA authorizes the Commissioner of SSA to fund P&As in each State, U.S. Territory, and the Native American population to provide advocacy as well as information and advice about obtaining vocational rehabilitation and employment services to our beneficiaries with disabilities.  SSA funds State P&As to provide protection and advocacy services to individuals with disabilities who receive Social Security disability insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Benefits.  The law is designed to provide better health care options and work incentives for people with disabilities who want to work.  Regulatory changes require SSA to establish an assistance and training program to support the expanded activities of P&As under TWWIIA.  Especially now that Employment Networks are in existence, there is a real need for P&A training surrounding any complaints that may be lodged against these new Ticket to Work entities.  REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall provide technical assistance to the 57 State and US Territorial as well as Native American P&A agencies participating in the project as follows: (1) Provide dispute resolution assistance to P&A personnel as disputes arise between beneficiaries and the employment networks and other service providers from which they are seeking or receiving services; (2) Conduct a training seminar for new Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS) program personnel using material developed in 2002 to address policies, processes and procedures that P&A personnel need to advocate on behalf of beneficiaries with disabilities.  Note: guidance on SSA programs and work incentives and other Federal programs will be provided by the SSA Regional Training Centers at Cornell, University of Missouri at Columbia and Virginia Commonwealth University; and 3) Act as a liaison for the flow of communication between SSA and the P&As.  This includes disseminating information to all of the participant P&As at the request of SSA, as well as conveying information to SSA on behalf of the projects.  Note:  contractor must have SSA?s prior approval on any material furnished to the P&As for this program.  The contractor shall provide information to SSA, when requested, to enable SSA to respond to public inquiries.  The contractor shall also be required to attend meetings and prepare reports for this requirement.  The period of performance will be for a base year with two 1-year options to extend the term of the contract.   NAPAS is the only known organization with the subject expertise and familiarity with the issues to provide the required specialized technical assistance.  Specifically, NAPAS is fully versed in the intricacies of protection and advocacy case law, P&A management issues, and methods to increase the effectiveness of these agencies in providing services to Social Security beneficiaries with disabilities.  Additionally, NAPAS is the only organization with the resources, previous experience and competence to immediately assume the responsibility of providing assistance to all 57 State and U.S. Territory P&As.  NAPAS has been involved in these types of services with the government and SSA since 1997.  SSA knows of no other source that has the capability to satisfy all of the requirements for this contract.  Interested parties that believe they have the capability to perform the services required should submit a capability statement to Barbara F. Hands by mail to: SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, 1710 GWYNN OAK AVENUE, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND 21207; by email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov; or by fax to 410-966-9310.  All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT - TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY SYSTEMS, and shall be received no later than 3:00 p.m. (EST) MAY 24, 2002.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with NAPAS.  All questions must be submitted in writing to the mailing address or email address listed above and marked to the attention of Barbara F. Hands. Telephone calls will not be accepted.
