<p>The Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) is an umbrella term used to describe a set of independent and discrete networks or products that are separated by Communities of Interest (COI). CENTRIXS is the US global, secure, information system to support multinational operations with shared, combined command, control and intelligence information up to the SECRET Releasable (REL) level. CENTRIXS is installed in partner nation countries and their military forces after they establish their specific requirements and relate the requirements with the supporting U.S. Combatant Commands (COCOM). The basic mission of CENTRIXS is to support the secure sharing and exchanging of intelligence and operational information through reliable communications connectivity, data manipulation, and automated processes. CENTRIXS networks provide COCOM commanders with enterprise services.<br /><br />The standard CENTRIXS architecture consists of servers, applications and encryption systems to form an IP-based network. There are approximately over 90 such networks. The MNIS PMO currently has shared Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) responsibility for some of these networks with COCOMs. Current MNIS PMO and vendor services for CENTRIXS support is through an existing contract. This PWS will address FTE support for such work.<br />Most of the MNIS portfolio's operational capabilities are currently or will be operated at DISA Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECC). The Contractor under this requirmement shall provide Tier FTE engineering and operations support in the Continental United States (CONUS), and may travel to several different Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations further detailed below. At the time of contract award, the Contractor must be capable of providing U.S. personnel currently exempt from foreign tax status as defined under the current Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) / Technical Expert Support Agreement (TESA) or other applicable foreign regulations (as determined by the governments of those countries within which the contractor shall be residing under this contract). It is expected that the Contractor will be able to provide 80% of proposed FTE support no earlier than the estimated award date of May 24, 2012, and no later than thirty days post award, and 100% of the FTE support no later than sixty days post award. The MNIS PMO is interested in an effective proposed staffing approach from the Contractor that can express an efficient staffing plan to meet the needs of the Government. Historically, there have been 40 FTEs supporting such work within the U.S. and at various COCOM locations around the world including JCMO (Tampa, FL), EUCOM (Stuttgart, Germany), PACOM (Oahu, Hawaii), AFRICOM (HQ, Stuttgart), CENTCOM (Tampa, FL, Kuwait, and Bahrain) STRATCOM (Tampa, FL),SOUTHCOM (Miami, FL), NORTHCOM (Colorado Spring, CO), Alexandria, VA and JFCOM (Suffolk, VA).<br /><br />The scope of this requirement is to provide FTE engineering and sustainment support for a wide range of program management, technical, research and development, procurement and operations/maintenance services to support the development, implementation and maintenance of the MNIS CENTRIXS systems. These objectives include: <br />&bull; Support and training of the existing systems operations.<br />&bull; Integrating and testing COTS and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) hardware and software (henceforth called equipment) capabilities to satisfy CENTRIXS, user and other mandated requirements.<br />&bull; Integrating and testing COTS and GOTS equipment capabilities to satisfy other CENTRIXS networks.<br />&bull; Addressing all necessary node work including but not limited to development, testing, integration, and sustainment operations.<br />&bull; Field network infrastructure and enterprise services and other MNIS portfolio capabilities as required.<br />&bull; Information Management and facilitation of data inputs in a standardized fashion.</p>
<p>The Draft RFP HC1047-12-R-4003 is attached for review. The Government is posting the Draft RFP to entertain industry's comments and or questions related to the forthcoming solicitation that will be posted via Fedbizopps.gov. All questions must be received no later than Friday, 10 Feb 2012 @ 10am, EST. All questions and or comments must be submitted in writing via email to listed Contract Specialist(s) and Contracting Officer. Please see the FBO annoucement for points of contacts to send questions.</p>
