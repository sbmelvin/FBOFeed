<DESC>Purpose of this Announcement. In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System, Section 3.2.2.4 Single Source Selection, this announcement is to inform the public/industry of the FAA's intention to procure the enclosed (see below)ISO 9001-2000 and ISO 14001 services from a selected source via single source procedures. The William J. Hughes Technical Center located in Atlantic City, NJ 08405 intends to enter into a single source award with Quality Management Institute (QMI) located in Springfield, Pa. The decision to contract on a sole source basis with QMI is based on the fact that this is a continuation of services that QMI has provided for the past 3 years for the Facilities Branch located at the WJHTC. This determination was also based on the fact that the FAA would have to absorb additional cost for ISO certifications already perform by QMI if a different vendor was selected. In addition, FAA time constraints are another factor in this single source determination.    A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. If your firm disagrees with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your company's capabilities, experience in providing the services enclosed and a comprehensive proposal to perform the required services. All responses must be direct to the Contracting Officer Jerry Hendricks and provided via e-mail or via postal services by COB 12 December 2005 5:30PM EST. SOW: Provide one (1) surveillance audit in FY 2006, two in FY2007, and two in FY 2008 to insure that the Division is maintaining its commitment to the ISO 9001-2000 Standard.  These surveillance audits shall not exceed five surveillance audits including the exercise of the two option years.  Each ISO 9001-2000 surveillance audit will take one day. Perform Registration audit for ISO 14001. This includes a pre-audit documentation review, preliminary assessment and Five (5) one day semi-annual surveillance audits (1) one in FY06, two in FY07, and two in FY08. Period of performance is estimated to begin in December 2005 and end in September 2006.  The requirement will contain two (2) one year options through September 2008. Award anticipated on 13 Dec 2005.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the development of a prototype Lunar Navigation and Communication Infrastructure (LNCI) system capable of near continuous telecommunications and precision navigation capability on and around the lunar surface to include the poles and nearby permanently shadowed crater floors, and areas that are never within line of sight to Earth-based assets.  The system must be able to provide capabilities and functionality much like the Global Positioning System (GPS) as well as provide communication functionality for the lunar environment. The system must be reliable and able to provide real-time or near real-time Earth bound transmission capability. The system must be capable of leveraging terrestrial communication infrastructure and provide connectivity for lunar assets. The system must be flexible and have provisions and consideration in use of multiple spacecraft evolving infrastructure suited to technology insertion and mitigation of technology obsolescence issues. The system may utilize missions of opportunity to support lunar missions and transition to lunar navigation and communication infrastructure after primary mission. The system must be capable by the end of the decade to support near term robotic lunar missions.  The criticality of this effort requires demonstrated expertise and operations in the development of end-to-end precision space-based navigation and communication infrastructures that have been successfully deployed as operational systems.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the prototype LNCI system from Johns Hopkins University/Applied Research Laboratory (JHU/APL). JHU/APL’s status as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) allows JHU/APL to function as an extension of a program or project office in providing, without an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI), oversight, risk reduction and problem solving capability in a manner that ensures the best interests of the government and contractors are protected. This ability allows the government to prototype government systems, then follow-on to specify and transition those systems (or parts thereof) to industry for production as appropriate and required. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  JHU/APL has unique capabilities and experience critical to the development of prototype lunar navigation and communications infrastructure.   JHU/APL was the originator of the Navy’s Transit Satellite System, the predecessor of the modern GPS. JHU/APL is a charter member of the GPS community and has pioneered cutting edge solutions for GPS usage. JHU/APL scientists are experts with regard to understanding orbit propagation in close vicinity to objects having non-uniform gravitational fields. JHU/APL has expertise in networking of radar sensors and the use of radar for tracking and navigation. JHU/APL has expertise in the areas of atomic and ultra-stable, non-atomic clocks, both of which are essential for navigation. JHU/APL is experienced with the use of regenerative Doppler for tracking of spacecrafts and is engaged in the development of new, non-inertial, non-radio navigation techniques.	  JHU/APL have developed space-based navigation and communication systems in the past and are experts in developing unique and innovative space based navigation and communication techniques.  It is further stated in FAR 6.302-1 (a)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in  substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  JHU/APL is currently integrating and qualifying radar payloads, navigation and communication payloads, and a navigation and communications spacecraft bus for a jointly funded effort by NASA and Department of Defense (DoD). This spacecraft bus will be directly applicable to LNCI.  JHU/APL with DoD jointly developed payloads and spacecraft systems to develop the navigation and communication technologies that have direct application toward LNCI.  This is a follow-on effort for continued development of highly specialized equipment that includes the navigation and communication spacecraft system that can be utilized for lunar missions.  Procurement of LNCI from any other source is expected to result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Dec 21, 2005. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a project partner to implement the second Robotic Lunar Exploration Mission (RLEP 2.)   The RLEP 2 mission entails lunar science research, lunar science payload, and the development of a common Lunar Lander System (applicable to other Exploration missions.)  NASA/MSFC was assigned the project under an internal NASA competition based largely on concepts and expertise contributed by Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab (JHU/APL.)   NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from JHU/APL pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2), unusual and compelling urgency.  To maintain the projected RLEP 2 launch date of January 2011, and preserve the near term activities that are required to integrate not only this mission but also help determine the entire program architecture, MSFC requires significant near term work over the next year in the area of project management, systems engineering, lunar lander design and trades, and world class lunar scientist experience (including that scientist acting as coordinator for a multitude of varied group of scientific and applied lunar technology interests).	 Only JHU/APL is in position to meet the required schedule based upon implementing their existing, unique, and innovative mission concept with an established project team including a world class lunar scientist.  In order to support a 2011 launch, MSFC must meet the following schedule and successfully implement the RLEP 2 project launch. Major project milestones are listed below: March 2006 – Trade Study Completion and Phase A Kickoff August 2006 -- System Requirements Review (SRR)  July 2007 -- Preliminary Design Review (PDR)  December 2008 -- Critical Design Review (CDR)  April 2010 -- Pre-Ship Review (PSR)  August 2010 -- Flight Readiness Review (FRR)  January 2011 -- Launch  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Health (NIH), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives.  The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  In this context, the NIAID’s mission includes the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations. These biological agents have been prioritized as Category A, B, and C.  Through this solicitation the NIAID is seeking to advance the development of therapeutics against selected NIAID Category A, B, and C viral pathogens via a focused, staged approach. Specifically the goal of this solicitation is to develop new, safe, and effective therapeutics for: 

Category A viral pathogens: Variola major and Viral hemorrhagic fevers;
Category B viral pathogens: Viral encephalitides; and 
Category C viral pathogens: Influenza.

The candidate therapeutic should be at a stage of development that is minimally within five (5) years of completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial.  This solicitation will support non-clinical studies, manufacturing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and other IND-, NDA-, or BLA-enabling studies.  The NIAID is particularly interested in candidate therapeutics that are within the regulatory purview of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that have broad spectrum activity.  See the actual solicitation for research areas that are NOT supported. 

It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of up to five (5) years beginning on or about September 29, 2006.  Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) NIH-NIAID-DMID-06-35 will be available electronically on or about December 15, 2005 and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

Once there, select “Funding Opportunities” then “RFPs Only” and then click on “BAA NIH-NIAID-DMID-06-35, entitled, ‘Development of Therapeutic Agents for Selected Viral Diseases.”  

Proposals will be due on or about February 15, 2006.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal for consideration by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-wide numbered note 26.

<DESC>Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) has a requirment for appropriately cleared and site-trained Security Escort Services at mutlipule locations.  DISA Computing Services (CS) datacenters provide routine and mission-critical computer processing resources and support to numerous government agencies on a fee-for-service basis, 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.  There are approximately 18 of these datacenters located throughout CONUS, Hawaii, and Europe.

Outsourcing of much work to local contractors when facility requirements arise is a standard cost-savings methodology employed in both business and the government today.  As the requirements to support data center equipment change throughout our enterprise and as DISA conducts routine and emergency maintenance on our building systems, DISA’s organic manpower to support these requirements continues to be reduced. 

Because of the sensitive and technical nature of our missions, DISA is mandated to provide proper security and supervision of contractor personnel granted access to DISA facilities to perform maintenance and new work.  DISA has multiple short-term and long-term requirements at many sites to provide qualified, trained, and cleared security escort personnel to support these requirements.  All personnel assigned as a Security Escort Specialist under this contract must at minimum possess a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Agency and Credit Checks (NCLC) adjudicated for IT-II sensitivity level or have been awarded an interim IT-II sensitivity level prior to the period of performance.

The Contractor shall provide appropriately cleared and site-trained Security Escort Specialists to provide escort services as operational requirements dictate for DISA Computing Services sites.  The number of these Security Escort Specialists and frequency of their assignments will be flexible, based on individual site requirements.  No specific training or skills beyond those otherwise delineated for Security Escort Specialists are required.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for an Active Layer Theatre Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) Program Management Support Contract.     

The Program Management Support effort is divided into two main tasks. The first is management of the overall contractor effort to ensure its responsiveness to program requirements. The second is direct support to the program office to include assistance in maintaining a program master, plan, assistance in preparing budgetary and programmatic documentation, and assistance in supporting risk analysis and risk management.

The successful bidder for this contract will not be allowed to compete as a prime contractor or participate as a subcontractor for the Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) contract to be funded under projects 0VA03019 and 0VA03020.

The envisaged bidding procedure for this IFB (Invitation for Bids) will be the BOA (Basic Ordering Agreement) procedure with the additional opportunity for the Member Nations in response to this NOI to nominate bidders in addition to the companies already included on a list of identified BOA vendors.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee (IC). NC3A intends to use the Best Value procedure in its evaluation of bids.

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Further performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at the level of NATO SECRET.

The project has been authorized by the IC in the amount of approximately 1.8 million Euros ($2.1 million USD). The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-11485-ALTBMD. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The tasks for Program Management Support center around the maintenance and upkeep of program data and records and the development of drafts of programmatic documents to include the Program Master Plan, forecasts of resource requirements, documentation of program risks, and support in the development of risk mitigation strategies. These activities include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Supporting the drafting of a Program Master plan and providing support to document the plan in an appropriate program management tool.

2. Ensuring that the necessary updating of the program master plan is accomplished in an accurate and timely manner.

3. Supporting the development and maintenance of a program work breakdown structure in both a functional and organizational configuration.

4. Maintaining an accessible file of contractor deliverables and coordinating distribution of contractor deliverables.

5. Maintaining a program office reference library and program office records.

6. Providing support for program cost estimates.

7. Supporting the development of annual program office budget estimates.

8. Drafting program annual/recurring financial and management reports.

9. Supporting the development of and ongoing updates to a program risk register.

10. Supporting the drafting of contingency/risk mitigation plans.

11. Supporting risk management reviews, both those internal to the program office and those conducted for the program steering committee.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE (Specimen in Annex V to Ref.A of NSIP Document 2261) is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Embassy in Brussels to submit a Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) on your behalf: 3 January 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) will be forwarded to those on the Bidder List: January 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD

4. Anticipated contract award date: April-June 2006

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB), plans to procure on a sole-source basis an FEI TitanBio Automated 3D Molecular Imaging System with FEI Company 5350 NE Dawson Creek Drive, Hillsboro, Oregon 97124. 

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.   The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The NCI has a need for advanced tools for high resolution imaging applications in nanobiology, which include fully automated tools for 2-Dimensional and 3-Dimensional imaging of nanoparticles, molecular complexes, cells and healthy and diseased tissues.  The NCI believes the FEI TitanBio Automated 3D Molecular Imaging System provides the necessary technological platform to achieve this goal.  The availability of this system is expected to significantly accelerate advances in NCI on imaging at molecular and atomic resolution.  Applications that are envisaged include: (i) imaging of multi-protein complexes, receptor-antibody complexes and molecular machines involved in cellular metabolism of healthy and diseased cells (ii) imaging of whole, cells, subcellular organelles, viruses and signaling networks at resolutions high enough to map the 3D organization at molecular resolution and (iii) structural analysis from nanoparticle delivery systems such as those based on liposomes, dendrimers, gold nanoshells, quantum dots and fullerenes, and their cellular localization in healthy and diseased tissue.  The FEI TitanBio Automated 3D Molecular Imaging System must have an electron optical design that is similar to or better than that demonstrated with the FEI Titan system, and must have automated multi-specimen loading system that can operate at cryogenic temperatures, and enhanced contrast as required for low-dose imaging applications.  It is essential that the system be capable of operation 7 days a week, 24 hours a day with minimal interruption for maintenance purposes.  The FEI TitanBio Automated 3D Molecular Imaging System must also be fully compatible with existing infrastructure at NCI for high resolution electron microscopic imaging.  FEI Company is the only manufacturer known that can provide the aforementioned system.  

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on December 15, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Please reference NCI-60013-NG on all correspondence.  Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is providing funding for a feasibility study to evaluate the technical and financial requirements for restoration and possible relocation of fuel depots damaged by the tsunami.  Repairing and upgrading these facilities will provide residents of Aceh Province with a reliable fuel supply.

This activity will include examining the requirements for repairing, modernizing, and potentially relocating fuel depots in Indonesia’s Aceh Province in an attempt to meet new fuel demands as well as prevent the recurrence of future damage.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $327,300 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM on January 6, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SUBJECT>A -- Ultra Light Dropsonde
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NOAA-OAR-ESRL
<RESPDATE>011606
<ARCHDATE>01302006
<CONTACT>Susan Labovitz, Contract Specialist, Phone (303) 497-7943, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email susan.labovitz@noaa.gov - Rhonda Nelson, Procurement Technician, Phone (303) 497-3487, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email Rhonda.Nelson@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL), Global Systems Division (GSD), (hereinafter referred to as government) desires to develop an ultra-light dropsonde for use aboard long-duration, high-altitude aerial vehicles that have limited payload capability.  Examples of such vehicles might be directed balloons, solar powered aircraft or Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). ***   


The aerial vehicle may be able to fly and loiter above weather systems, such as hurricanes, and release dropsondes to measure temperature, humidity and wind profiles through the depth of the storm.  The weight of the dropsondes is a key aspect of this concept.  The lighter they are, the more of them can be carried to altitude to get more profiles of the weather system to improve the predictions of intensity and track.  The goal is dropsondes that weigh no more than 20 grams each.***      
 

It is the government's intent to procure (1) engineering proto-types of ultra light sondes; and (2) a ground-based station for testing functionality as these sondes are carried aloft, by some means, and radio back digital data from which profiles of temperature, humidity and wind can be determined in real-time. If these tests are successful, at some later time the government may procure (1) production versions of the dropsonde; and (2) flight qualified versions of the ground station equipment to receive and process signals of the dropsondes as they are dropped from a high-altitude platform and fall toward the surface.*** 

The purpose of this request for information is to determine (i) if there are sources capable of satisfying the government's requirements, especially the weight requirement; (ii) to determine availability of commercial items or, to the extent commercial items suitable to meet government's needs are not available, non-development items are available that:  (A) Meet government's requirements; (B) Could be modified to meet the government's requirements; or (C) Could meet the government's requirements if those requirements were modified to a reasonable extent; (iii) to determine the extent to which commercial items or non-development items could be incorporated at the component level; and (iv) to determine the practices of firms engaged in producing, distributing, and supporting commercial items, such as terms for warranties, buyer financing, maintenance, and packing and marking. No proposals are being requested or accepted under this synopsis. Feedback addressing the clarity, feasibility, scope, and potential alternative means of meeting the government's requirement is sought. ***   
 

The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for these requirements is 541710 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. Your response should identify your business size (large or small) in relation to this NAICS Code.  If your company has 500 employees are more you are considered a large business.***    
  

NOAA will consider all comments, supportive or critical, but may or may not use these individual comments. In addition to comments, those interested are requested to provide a budgetary estimate for the System as specified herein. Interested Sources are also encouraged to submit product literature in response to this RFI. Any submission of such product literature or "catalog cut sheets" will be treated separate from, and will have no bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposals. NOAA will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments. NOAA, as noted above, is assessing the existence of sources and is requesting written comments from industry on the requirements that follow. Written comments shall be submitted no later than 2:00 P.M. Mountain Daylight Savings Time, January 16, 2006. Sources interested in providing comments shall respond in writing to Ms. Susan Labovitz, Contract Specialist, DOC, NOAA, MRAD, MC3, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305-3328. Submittals may also be made via E-mail to Susan.Labovitz@noaa.gov, by Facsimile to (303) 497-3163 or express delivery; however, telephone responses are not acceptable. This Notice is not a Request for Proposals, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotes. ***   


System Requirements:  The dropsondes and the receiving equipment shall operate together as a system to produce temperature, humidity and wind profiles as a function of pressure height.  The desired weight of an individual dropsonde is 20grams.  The government notes that one way to minimize dropsonde weight is to not have positioning equipment such as a GPS receiver on each dropsonde, but rather to track the sonde with the radio signal used to carry the measured data to radio receiving equipment.  One way of doing this is suggested in “Atmospheric Sondes and Method for Tracking”, Chadwick and MacDonald, US Patent 6,421,010.  There may be other suggestions that can result in the capability for a 20-gram sonde that can be dropped from 65,000 feet. ***   


All parts of the system must be capable of operating for long periods (up to weeks) at ambient conditions experienced at 50,000-65,000 feet.  The engineering proto-types mentioned above will be tested in an environmental chamber by the government.  The testing regime will include a cold soak and then operation inside the chamber as the temperature and pressure are changed to simulate vertical movement through the atmosphere.  The engineering proto-types will also be flight tested by launching the sonde with a GPS equipped balloon from the surface and comparing the track measured by the proto-type dropsonde and ground-station with that measured by the GPS aboard the balloon during ascent. ***


The optimum radio frequency and power level to be used to send the data to the receiving station may be different for different ways of tracking the sonde, so the government expects suggestions as to what the optimum frequency and power level should be.  Other relevant suggestions such as polarization, etc. are also welcome.  The radio frequency to be used by any engineering proto-types that may be procured must be approved by the government prior to delivery.***    


The size and weight of the engineering proto-type dropsondes and ground station that may be procured and used for ground-based testing will not have to meet the same requirements as projected flight qualified equipment that may be procured at a later time by the government.  However, there have to be clearly stated paths, with projected costs, of achieving the desired sizes,  weights, and configurations for flight aboard the projected airborne platform.  For example, the proto-type items may be made using a number of widely available integrated circuits that would be merged into a single custom integrated circuit for the production items.  Also, the ground station design must be capable of being realized under the flight constraints of the projected aerial vehicle.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 562910   The purpose of this notice is to update contractors with regards to the "Expanding the Industry Base" Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs). The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management announced its intention to establish  BPAs for supplemental emergency response support services in a synopsis posted August 16, 2005 at http://www.epa.gov/etib/. The Government originally planned to set up one BPA per each of the ten EPA Regions and initially award BPAs to Regions 1, 2, and 3, with the remaining 10 EPA regions to  follow.   However, the Government has determined that one national BPA, serving all ten EPA Regions, will be more suitable for this requirement.  The Government will post an updated synopsis and sources sought notice in the near future which reflect this change.   Vendors should carefully review  the revised synopsis and sources sought notice as there may be other changes.

<DESC>The following clarification is provided:

The sensor phenomenology and performance specifications are: HRTE (High Resolution Terrain Data) 5-6 (1.0 m to 0.3 m horizontal resolution, 0.3 to 0.1 m vertical resolution) with an absolute accuracy of 10 cm (3D RMS 1 sigma) at a stand off range of 10,000 (NGA¹s threshold) to 60,000 ft (NGA¹s goal) and an area rate of 100 km2/hr (threshold) to 500 km2/hr (goal) at HRTE-5 from a fixed wing aerial platform.  The accuracy specification should be consistent with typical commercial standards (for         example, as documented by Maune, Digital Elevation Model Technologies and Applications: The DEM Users Manual, ASPRS, 2001).

The following additional information is provided:


Current development and deployment schedules should support delivery not later than 10 months after award.  Longer development schedules might be considered for 'significantly greater capability' (area rate or stand off distance, for example); however, NGA desires to have a fielded capability by the end of CY06. The initial units are expected to be flown in KingAir (RC-12) class airframes; subsequent units would be migrated to UAV (Predator A&B).Nominal payloads are well known for these vehicles; autonomy of the payload is highly desirable (UAV-class), but human in the loop is acceptable and human in the cockpit is also acceptable (current standard practice).

Classified responses are welcome as long as they are submitted in proper security channels to the following address:

Operating - Each cartridge shall provide the following functional,  operational and performance capabilities when fired from an unmodified standard  issue 12-gauge shotgun (i.e. Mossberg 500, Mossberg 590, Remington Model 870  and Winchester Model 1200) without any additional ancillary devices, sighting  systems or modifications. 2. Non-Lethality - When fired into a ballistic clay target per NIJ Standard  0101.03 (no armor or fabric shall be used), the maximum depression made by each  of the projectiles at the 10 meter range shall be less than or equal to 42  millimeters. The minimum depression made by any projectile in the target at 10  meters and 20 meters shall be greater than or equal to 5 millimeters. 3. Chamber pressure - The mean chamber pressure, of the 12-gauge shotgun,  between the temperature range of 49Â°C and -32Â°C shall not exceed 13,000 pounds  per square inch (psi), nor shall any individual chamber pressure exceed 15,000  psi. 4. Hit probability - Of the total number of rounds per test group (e.g.  Mossberg 500 ambient at 10m), a minimum of 80% of the rounds must have scored  at least one impact on the E-silhouette.  5. Velocity - The design muzzle velocity of the cartridge shall be verified  during the design verification test and first article verification.  This shall  serve as a baseline for future test.  6. Non-fragmentation - The projectiles shall not produce explosive and  fragmenting kinetic force upon impact.   7. Compatibility - Each cartridge shall be capable of being loaded, fired, or  extracted from an unmodified standard issue 12-gauge shotgun (i.e. Mossberg  500, Mossberg 590, and Winchester 1200) without binding or without damage to  the shotgun and without round-induced shotgun malfunction.

<DESC>A key goal of the Cancer Imaging Program (CIP) in the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis of the National Cancer Institute is to facilitate the development of promising imaging agents so they can be safely and effectively used in clinical trials to provide unique diagnostic, staging, and therapy selection and monitoring information. These facilitative efforts are broad in scope including pre-clinical development, creation of SOPs for CMC and QC, IND preparation and submission (including exploratory IND), supporting and conducting imaging clinical trials, and incorporating imaging into therapeutic trials. To support these activities, there are several specific resources including DCIDE for pre-clinical development, SAIC contract resources to assist in IND preparation, and a competitively selected core of 4 institutions contracted to perform Phase I/II Clinical Trials of new imaging agents. In addition the NCI supports a number of cooperative groups including the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) for the performance of larger multi-center trials both of imaging agents and integrating imaging into therapeutic trials.  In addition to developing agents for use in NCI sponsored clinical trials, it is hoped that such development will progress to provision of a useful agent for other investigational trials including commercial therapeutic drug development and eventually to a commercial imaging agent product.

In order to provide 18 FLT to support larger multi-center trials, NCI would like to engage a vendor that would be able to produce and distribute 18FLT on a unit dose basis to regional and national sites to support clinical trials. The key requirement would be for multi-dose production capability to the standards set in the QA and acceptance SOPs to support the existing IND. The product may be produced employing the CMC developed by NCI and submitted with the IND 71,260 or by an alternative CMC process that produces equivalent product. If an alternative CMC is employed it must be provided for submission to the FDA and accepted by the FDA. In the alternative a DMF may be filed but also must be accepted by the FDA. 

The successful proposal may be by a single vendor proposal or a subcontract among entities including academic institutions however the capability to produce the tracer under cGMP conditions and to distribute in a timely manner must be in evidence. The distribution coverage should be defined and will be evaluated in the selection of vendors. Cost proposal should be broken into 5 separate budget lines: 1) Cost of development and implementation of synthesis; 2) Cost of required documentation and filing; 3) Ongoing administrative cost to maintain capability in an active status; 4) Unit dose cost (adjusted for volume); and 5) delivery cost (may be broken into zones).  

Vendors will be provided copies of the FLT SOPs for CMC and QA as well as product acceptance criteria under a confidentiality agreement. These materials are to assist the potential vendors in responding to the RFP and cannot be copied and must be returned. 

SAIC reserves the right to make site visits to bidding vendors prior to the awarding of the contract and also reserves the right to inspection of the sites and records as required.

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for a Mars Orbital Platform Scout Mission. NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) plans to provide an instrument concept to a mission proposal in response to the NASA Science Mission Directorate MARS Scout 2011 opportunity.  The Mars Scout Announcement of Opportunity (AO) is expected to be released approximately in April 2006 with the Step-1 proposals due 90 days later. Several proposals will be selected to proceed to Step-2 (Phase A). A launch date in 2011 is planned. LaRC is seeking partners to participate in developing an instrument concept that will address the goals and objectives of the MARS Scout Program. Langley’s contribution leverages core competencies in atmospheric modeling, aeronomy, and passive remote sensing of atmospheric composition and temperature.   This synopsis solicits partners in the definition, design, development, integration, and test of scientific instrumentation. Of particular interest are partners capable of delivering space borne science instrumentation for measuring the thermal structure, chemical composition and dust loading of the atmosphere of Mars. In particular, infrared radiometers covering 1 to 17um, including sensors for nadir and limb viewing, are sought. Responses are solicited from all U.S. industries, academia, non-profit organizations, national laboratories, other government agencies, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers. If selected through this synopsis, each partner is expected to become a full member of the technical assessment, proposal development, and mission implementation team. LaRC will require each selected partner to provide a letter of commitment. LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the providers of science instrumentation, provided the mission concept is selected for implementation.  Teaming offers will be reviewed, evaluated, and selected at NASA LaRC. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria listed in the order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel:  This criterion evaluates the offerors relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel (with resumes) available to support the development. Provide substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments. Capability includes quality and management process certifications and systems. (2) Cost and schedule control:	This criterion evaluates the offerors ability to control both cost and schedule. The offeror should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.   (3) Facilities:  This criterion evaluates the offerors facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The offeror should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.  NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in response to this synopsis.  NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposal preparation costs incurred by team members.  It is expected that the teaming organizations will participate actively in the proposal process and that selection of the proposal for mission implementation would result in contract(s) for the selected partners. The synopsis teaming opportunity does not represent a guarantee to selection of award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA), conceptual designs, technical data, proposal inputs, schedule and cost estimates consistent with the NASA Scout guidelines as described in the AO. Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages and shall address each of the evaluation criteria below.  Resumes of key personnel do not count against the total allocated page count.   All responses shall be submitted to LaRC electronically via e-mail by 5:00 local time, January 6, 2006, to: Gaudy M. Bezos-OConnor, at Gaudy.M.Bezos-Oconnor@nasa.gov.  Technical Questions should be directed to Michael Gazarik at Michael.J.Gazarik@nasa.gov or 757-864-1243.

<DESC>TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is seeking qualified sources for a five year Production effort beginning in FY06 for the Block Ia unitary warhead variant of  the XM982 â€œExcaliburâ€ a 155mm artillery projectile.  A modification to an  existing contract is anticipated in March 2006 with estimated round quantities  of 170-270.  Follow-on contract awards are anticipated beginning in October  2006 with estimated round quantities of 150-350 in FY07, 300-500 in FY08, 400- 600 in FY09, and 500-700 in FY10.  Deliveries will be within 20 months after  award and within 12 months after exercise of each option.   The Excalibur Program is for a Precision-Guided, Extended-Range family of 155mm  projectiles to deliver precise, lethal, cost effective fires at ranges of up to  35 km and greater.  The 155mm Excalibur projectile will enable the maneuver  commander to precisely defeat critical targets while minimizing collateral  damage and unexploded ordnance.  Excalibur performance will be largely  dependant upon accurate target locating systems and sensors.  This program  supports the requirements of the US Army and those of the Swedish Army.  It  uses an incremental development approach with time-phased improvements in  performance capabilities.   The first unitary warhead, Block Ia-1, began  production in FY05 and is currently in production.  The second unitary warhead,  Block Ia-2, is in SD&D phase, and is expected to begin production in 1QFY07.   The performance specification PRF 12999870 is posted for your review in  response to this market survey at  http://procnet.pica.army.mil/dbi/DynCBD/SourcesSought.cfm  All responses to this market survey are required to be English.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Intent to award Sole Source
<DESC>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a sole source commercial purchase order to General Electric Company (GE).  The requirement is to relocate the USAF Academy Hospital GE MRI unit and GE CT unit to a new building located on the Academy, as well as lease a GE Signa mobile 1.5T MRI for 3 months and GE Light Speed Mobile CT unit for one month while the relocation takes place.  The USAF Academy has an important need to keep continued services during the relocation of these two units.  Because these are GE units, it is essential that the models remain consistent in use and teach-ability aspects.  The purpose for this sole source acquisition is to provide similar models for use and compatibility between work stations, as well as keeping the service agreement with GE intact for the Academy Units. GE is capable of meeting the relocation needs of the USAFA Hospital as well as the leasing of the Signa 1.5 MRI and Light Speed CT equipment because of the similarity to the units already in place at the Academy.  Using non-GE models would increase time and costs because of the training involved in learning a new system.  Using any other company to relocate the existing units would void the service agreement in place with GE.  GE is the only brand name/sole source that can satisfy the government’s requirements.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423450 and the size standard is 100 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  

Any company that feels they have items that meet the needs of the Government must submit their   technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>58 -- RIID/Mobile Testing at NTS
<DESC>The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) of the Department of Homeland Security is soliciting manufacturers interested in supplying commercially available gamma and neutron radiation detection systems for an upcoming test campaign.  Systems to be tested are hand-held, backpack and mobile devices.  The scheduled tests will characterize radiation detection performance in field-like conditions using realistic sources, threat representative test objects and operational employment scenarios.  The results from these tests will be made available to interested government (Federal, State, and local) officials subject to classification guidelines.

Prior to scenario-based testing, all systems will be pre-tested at the test site using selected radioactive sources from American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard N42.34 to validate that the systems meet the requirements listed below.  Systems that do not meet the requirements listed below in pre-testing will be returned to the manufacturer and will not be utilized in scenario-based testing.

At a minimum, hand-held instruments shall: be designed to meet ANSI standard N42.34 for the detection and identification of radionuclides; must have both gamma-ray and neutron detectors; perform near real-time radionuclide identification and provide gamma exposure or dose-rate measurements; detect photon energies from approximately 50 to 3000 keV and photon exposure rates from 50 micro R/h (measured at the instrument surface); be able to transfer data to a computer; be capable of operation if the user is wearing gloves or if the instrument is enclosed in anti-contamination protection (e.g., plastic bag); and operate on field-replaceable or rechargeable batteries for a minimum of 2 hours of continuous use.

At a minimum, backpack systems shall: be wearable, have hands-free operation; weigh no more than 11 kg; have both gamma-ray and neutron detectors; have near real-time capability to distinguish man-made sources of gamma radiation from natural background; detect photon energies from approximately 50 to 3000 keV and photon exposure rates from 25 micro R/h (measured at the instrument surface); have separate indicators for detection of gamma and neutron radiation; notify user that radiation levels exceed a pre-determined threshold through audible and/or vibratory alarm (visual alarm optional) within 5 seconds of detection; be designed to prevent water ingress from rain, condensing moisture, or high humidity; and operate on field-replaceable or rechargeable batteries for a minimum of 8 hours of continuous use.

At a minimum, mobile systems shall: have both gamma-ray and neutron detectors; be used in a road-worthy vehicle; capable of identification both while moving and while stationary; provide near real-time radionuclide identification; detect photon energies from approximately 50 to 3000 keV; detect and identify a 16 micro Curie Cs-137 source while moving at 5 mph at a distance of 3 meters (distance of closest approach); notify user that radiation levels exceed a pre-determined threshold through audible, visual, or vibratory alarm within 5 seconds of detection; provide real-time position information; store at least 3 days worth of data from continuous operation and transfer data to a computer; and operate on 12 Volts DC.

Manufacturers should be aware that equipment may be damaged during testing.  At the conclusion of testing, the equipment will be returned to the manufacturer, c.o.d., in the condition the equipment is in at the conclusion of the testing.  Neither the Department of Homeland Security, nor its agents will be responsible for the condition of the equipment when returned to the manufacturer.  As a condition for participating in this testing program, each manufacturer must agree in advance to hold harmless all of these parties for the condition of the equipment.

Additional participation and testing conditions are as follows:

1. Interested manufacturers will provide to DHS detection systems, calibration certificates, complete instruction manuals with operating instructions and data formats, a short description of the instrument type, general use and performance (test results if available), a picture of the instrument, a list of specifications, customer lists if available, training materials if available, and the contact information for a technical representative of the manufacturer. 
2. The list of instruments to be sent for testing shall include model number and type of detector as well as the category in which you are requesting to test each instrument.
3. For both hand-held and backpack systems, two identical units must be supplied.  If a mobile system is to be tested, one unit must be supplied.
4. Only calibrated instruments will be accepted for the testing program.
5. The instruments should be shipped with optimized working parameters and software packages as no changes to the instrument other than alarm level settings will be permitted during testing. If manufacturers request to have their equipment tested under multiple parameter sets or with a different software package, then the manufacturer will submit more than one set of instruments, one for each set of parameters.
6. Manufacturers shall NOT send equipment without contacting DHS first to obtain shipping instructions and executing a Bailment Agreement. The Bailment Agreement shall be signed and returned to DHS before December 29, 2005 5:00pm Eastern Time.
7. Equipment must be shipped so it is received by DHS in Nevada by January 6, 2006.  Only equipment received by the deadline will be tested.
8. Manufacturers will pay to ship systems to and from Nevada.
9. Manufacturers are not allowed to exchange instruments after the initial submission. If the manufacturer produces a newer model during the testing period this instrument may be tested at a future time. 
10. Instruments that are not equipped with both gamma-ray and neutron detectors will be returned to the manufacturer without testing.
11. Systems failing to pass the pre-test will be returned to the manufacturer without further testing.
12. Non-operational systems will be returned to the manufacturer without further testing.
13. All testing will be conducted by DHS operators.
14. Subject to classification guidelines, manufacturers will be informed how well their systems performed.  However, neither the actual test protocols nor the raw data will be provided to the manufacturer.
15. Systems must be received in Nevada by January 6, 2006 and will be returned at the conclusion of testing.  Detailed logistics instructions will be provided upon request.
16. Manufacturers who wish to participate in the program must submit an executed Bailment Agreement by December 29, 2005.  To obtain the Bailment Agreement, interested manufacturers must contact Brian Kehoe at brian.kehoe@dhs.gov, (202) 254-2364. For technical information, contact Daniel Blumenthal at daniel.blumenthal@dhs.gov, (202) 254-6186.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to Egypt invites expressions of interest and submission of pre-qualification information, for the purpose of short-listing U.S. (only) consulting engineering firms to provide engineering services. Services are required for providing various small-scale infrastructure construction activities in several Egyptian Governorates.  These small-scale construction activities were mostly identified under the Master Plans of two existing projects and are located in several Egyptian Governorates including: Fayoum, Beni Suef, Minia, Luxor, Daqahliya, and the New Valley.  The construction includes activities such as wastewater collection, treatment, and reuse systems; water treatment, transmission and distribution systems; and environmental assessments and other related work, including Lake Qarun clean up and reuse of ground water and wastewater.  

The consultant shall undertake any necessary studies, data collection and analyses, environmental studies, and required engineering services, preparation of bid documents, selection of construction contractors, and providing construction management services for activities that will be funded by USAID under Fixed Amount Reimbursement Agreements or Host Country construction contracts.  These construction activities were identified in Master Plan (MP) studies or Basis of Design Reports developed by CDM International Inc. and Montgomery Watson Harza (MWH) under earlier or current USAID-funded contracts.  Engineering designs for construction of some proposed activities are currently being developed by the same firms. BOTH CDM AND MWH WILL BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE FOR, AND SUBMIT PRE-QUALIFICATION INFORMATION FOR THIS CMC CONTRACT.  Master Plan (MP) studies or Basis of Design Reports as well as other engineering designs will be made available to pre-qualified offerors .

The CMC's responsibilities shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following major items: developing  prequalification criteria, bid documents, and evaluation criteria or validate the same if earlier developed under other USAID funded efforts or the GOE and their counterparts; Perform feasibility studies of the small-scale construction activities described above and submit small-scale activities deemed feasible to USAID for approval of construction; Provide Final Designs, as needed, for construction activities which have been approved by USAID; Provide related complementary and supplementary support needed by the GOE Counterparts in the implementation of construction of approved small-scale activities including but not limited to the development of bid documents; Administer, inspect, and monitor all construction activities; Determine the capability and acceptability of subcontractors that may be proposed by the construction contractors; Ensure the development and implementation of a Facility Start-up Program; Process variation (change) orders; Oversight, on behalf of the employer, of the construction contractors to ensure progress of work in accordance with the terms of the construction contracts; Provide all construction management services relevant to completion of approved projects; Act as Employer’s "Engineer" in the administration of construction; Perform all CQC tasks to ensure all construction meets contract specifications; Monitor overall program budget and contract costs; Review and certify payment requests for interim and final payment submitted by the construction contractors; and Provide inspection services during the Defects Liability Period to verify acceptable completion of all work per contract specifications for proposed construction activities.
 
The CMC's responsibilities shall include reviewing, updating, and validating existing contracts, reports, analysis and other documentation such as environmental reviews or assessments, master plans, feasibility studies, and engineering designs. NOTE: Relevant documentation that will impact the work for which services are herein described will be provided to all pre-qualified firms that participate in this procurement.

N.B. The CMC's responsibilities shall also include work to close out the ongoing USAID-funded Water Improvement Project in Alexandria, and possibly, some minor work on other ongoing construction activities.  In particular, CMC’s responsibilities will include the provision of inspection services during the Defects Liability Period of the Alexandria Water Improvement construction contract, to verify acceptable completion of all work per contract specifications for proposed construction activities, and subsequently, assistance with close-out of the contract. Minor assistance on other contracts, such as supervision of final testing, certification and contract close-out, may be required, as directed by USAID. 

A cost plus fixed fee, type contract is contemplated to be awarded.  The expected duration of the contract is three years with the possibility of granting contract extension(s) believed necessary for completion and closing out of all activities or undertaking additional activities required to successfully achieve the objective and results of the construction program. Issuance of this request does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the Government nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation or submission of any information.  It is a requirement that the firms must comply with USAID geographic code 000 (USA) for nationality and source regulations.

Consulting engineering firms are expected to demonstrate the following, which will be used for evaluating firm qualifications: (A) Applicable international experience and capability to provide the required experienced personnel to implement the work, (B) Organizational capacity and financial resources, (C) Similar services and work experience.  Experience in the Middle East and/or Egypt and/or similar developing country environment is desirable.  USAID requests that interested consulting engineering firms submit six copies of completed US Government Standard Form SF 330 Architect-engineer Qualifications, Part II (general Qualifications) and SF330 Part I (contract specific qualifications).  Those forms can be found at http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?formType=SF .  It is anticipated that the selected consultant will sign a direct contract with USAID to provide services subject to the availability of funds.  The firm's current financial statement and an affirmative statement that the firm can meet USAID nationality and source regulations must be submitted.  Copies of interested firm's brochures and annual report may also be of value in presenting the firm’s qualification.

The completed pre-qualification information and related statements must be received no later than January 17, 2006, 3:30 PM Cairo time, at the following address.  Additional information submitted after that date may be rejected by USAID.

If sent by U.S. mail: Mr. John May, Contracting Officer, Office of Procurement, USAID Unit 64902, APO AE 09839-4902.

No RFP will be issued.  Consulting engineering firms will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria found in the AID Acquisition Regulations, Part 736.602-3 (B) and their assigned relative weights as follows: ((1) Specialized experience of the firm with the type of service required (15%), (2) Capacity of the firm to perform the work within the time limitations (10%), (3) Past record of performance on contracts with USAID or other Government agencies and private industry with respect to such factors as control of costs, quality of work, and ability to meet schedules (20%), (4) Ability to assign an adequate number of qualified key personnel from the organization, including a competent supervising representative having considerable experience in responsible positions on work of a similar nature (15%), (5) The portions of the work the architect-engineer is able to perform with its own forces when required (5%), (6) Ability of the architect-engineer to furnish or to obtain required materials and equipment (5%), (7) Familiarity with the localities where the projects are situated (15%), (8) Financial capacity (10%), (9) Responsibility of the architect-engineer under standards provided in FAR subpart 9.1.

USAID will establish a short list of at least three qualified firms as per FAR part 36.602-3(C).  USAID will provide the draft statement of work, a list of questions to be addressed and evaluation criteria to the short listed firms for purposes of holding discussions and/or presentations.  After the final selection of the most qualified firm to perform the work, USAID will request a cost proposal from, and will negotiate with, this top ranked firm.  If a satisfactory contract cannot be concluded, USAID may negotiate with the next ranked firm."

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of local Engineering Firms and local talents, small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women -owned business concerns in this activity as prime contractors or subcontractors in accordance with Part 19 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  In this respect, it is anticipated that the prime contractor will make every reasonable effort to identify and, make maximum practicable use of such concerns.  All other selection evaluation criteria being found equal, the participation of such concerns may become a determining factor for selection.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costa that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costa that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

I.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

The Senior Advisor/Training Coordinator (TC) reports to the Division Chief for Europe and Asia, Office of Civilian Police and Rule of Law (CIVPOL office), Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), U.S. Department of State and manages all aspects of training for civilian police and criminal justice professionals deploying to peacekeeping missions through programs managed by the CIVPOL office.  The CIVPOL office currently manages programs in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Haiti, Liberia, East Timor, Serbia & Montenegro and Sudan.  However the number and location of programs are subject to change.  The TC must oversee pre-deployment training currently being conducted by three INL CIVPOL contractors – Dyncorp International (DI), Civilian Police International (CPI) and Pacific Architects and Engineers/Homeland Security Corporation (PAE/HSC).  The TC is responsible for ensuring that training meets the needs of the missions.

Background

The CIVPOL office manages civilian police and criminal justice programs in post-conflict locations throughout the world for the Department of State.  Police officers and law enforcement and criminal justice experts are deployed to these locations to serve as part of international peacekeeping efforts.  Because the U.S. does not have a national police force from which to draw personnel, the CIVPOL office has contracts with private contractors (currently DI, CPI and PAE/HSC as noted above) to recruit, select, train, equip, deploy and support the officers and experts.  An approximately 10-day pre-deployment training course has been developed by the incumbent which includes, but is not limited to: (1) final selection activities (physical fitness and agility tests, firearms tests, driving tests, psychological testing and evaluation and management oral boards), (2) classroom training addressing topics ranging from healthy lifestyles in these challenging mission environments to history and culture of the deployment region to human rights and trafficking in persons to expatriate taxation issues and (3) practical training such as defensive tactics, first aid and team building exercises.  It is the responsibility of the TC to work with INL program managers and the contractors to schedule training, ensure that it is conducted efficiently, professionally and in a timely manner and is revised and updated as necessary.

The CIVPOL office may also be involved in establishing a ready roster of rapidly deployable CIVPOL as well as building foreign capacity to provide quality CIVPOL.  As these programs are developed and implemented, the TC will be responsible for developing and implementing appropriate training.

Level of Effort

The position is full-time, with a minimum of 40 hours per week.  During training classes, weekend and evening work will be required.

Relationships  
         
	The TC will report to Division Chief for Europe and Asia, Office of Civilian Police and Rule of Law (CIVPOL office), Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), U.S. Department of State.

Travel and Position Location

•	The position is located in Washington, D.C.
•	The TC is required to stay on-site full time during training courses.  Currently, training courses are being conducted in Fredericksburg, VA and in Leesburg, VA.
•	Occasional domestic and international travel is also required.

Position Elements

•	Assess and update as necessary the training curriculum for pre-deployment training of U.S. CIVPOL ensuring that training is mission appropriate.
•	Schedule pre-deployment training with INL program officers and relevant contractors.
•	Working closely with INL program officers and contractors, develop schedule for training, determine appropriate, qualified instructors for training classes (along with fallback options) and contact Department of State (DOS) instructors to schedule their particular classes.
•	Manage and direct training with program officers and contractors (numbers, schedules, other training issues).
•	Run training classes and handle on-site training issues.
•	Monitor classes while in session for relevance and quality.
•	While class is in session, send daily reports concerning officers dropped from the course and the reasons therefore to program officers.
•	Email a weekly training report to the CIVPOL office.
•	Coordinate assembly of diplomatic passport packages and conduct passport brief (currently only for Iraq class).
•	Maintain training files.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
This incorporates provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 06. NAICS code 541690 and small business size standard of $6.5 million. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders also applies to this requirement. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to the Constella Group, LLC.  Constella will provide statistical support for the Center for Mental Health Research on AIDS (CMHRA), consisting of advice on statistical issues related to experimental design, power and sample size calculations, management of data for statistical analyses, data analyses, development of statistical methods specifically needed for appropriate analysis of data of interest to CMHRA, interpretation of results of data analyses, preparation of written descriptions of data analysis methods and results for publications and reports, and preparation of manuscripts for publication of novel statistical methods or applications developed for CMHRA. When carrying out the various statistical analyses, Constella will use (in consultation with the CMHRA) a variety of statistical procedures, which may include, but may not be limited to, fixed-, random-, and mixed-effect analysis of variance, general linear models, logistic regression and other categorical analysis methods, factor analysis and other multivariate techniques, Bayesian methods, and methods developed specifically for the analysis of NIMH data.

Specifically, the primary aim of this contract is for Constella to analyze (in consultation with CMHRA) the data from the NIMH supported study PACTG 188: “Neurodevelopmental evaluation of HIV Seropositive and Seronegative Children”.  The data from PACTG 188 will be provided by NIMH. The objectives of the study are to compare neurobehavioral development of children perinatally infected with HIV to uninfected children born to HIV+ mothers as well as a non HIV-exposed control group.  In addition, the second objective is to identify in the group with HIV-infection, those infants and children that have a divergent level of profile of functioning, and to determine both behavioral and medical predictors for such a natural history.  Finally, the NIMH wants to see whether it is possible on basis of the data, using a form of item analysis, to establish a shortened assessment that would be highly sensitive to changes in the normal neurobehavioral development and that were prognostic for a worse outcome. 

An award to any other source would affect the NIH’s prior and current research under protocols.  Constella has been involved with the NIMH AIDS program since 1986.  Constella has also performed a similar analysis of data under a larger R&D contract.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI60026 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892, Attention: Tonya D.

<ARCHDATE>02062006
<CONTACT>James Daily, 586 574-7095
<DESC>SUBJECT: Request for Information (2nd&3rd): 12Kw Test stand for Fuel Cell Power Generators Question: In the question section, someone asked if the FC would output 1000A at 400V to which you answered, yes.  However, this is more than 400 KW where in the requirements it says 10-12kW is needed.  I assume that this was an error and that the 400V and  1000A will not be achieved simultaneously (as in most fuel cells)? Answer: Want load box capable of handling 1000A and 400V.  Not simultaneous. Question: You mention that heating the gas before it enters the fuel cell power generator is not required.  Is any humidification required at all or simply gas mass flow control?  Does this fuel cell power generator include balance of plant (not required t o be provided with the test station)?     Answer: Want the capability of measuring gas.  Fuel Cell power generator includes BOP. Question: Is back pressure control required or only pressure measurement as listed in the solicitation? Answer: Want back pressure measurement. Question:  I see a power load listed as 12kW yet I also see a listing of 1000Amps And 400 Volts. Is this 1000A at 400V or Up to 1000A. Is the 400V a constant or a variable? Answer: Up to 1000A, and up to 400V.  400V is variable Question: Is the thermal management system a single loop system, or a multiple loop system. Some designs of FCPM have a separate loop for power electronics and compressor cooling. Answer: We will handle cooling issues. Question: Is this stand to control BOP (Balance Of Plant) i.e....Fuel management, compressor control or does the FCPM have its own control, and interface would be required? Answer: No, test stand will not control BOP.  Interface is required for measurement so we can see what is going in and out of the FC. Question:  Does the facility have a combustible and non-combustible exhaust system? Answer: Non-combustible exhaust
