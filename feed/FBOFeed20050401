<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded contract DTFAAC-05-D-00028, February 9, 2005, for the acquisition of ARC detectors critical to the operation of the ASR-9 radars.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 334511.  An Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery type was awarded for a Base Year with four-option years.  The award allows for a minimum guaranteed quantity of 10 with an annual estimated quantity of 50.  The estimated annual quantities were 50 for each option years.  However, due to changes in the FAA's requirement the basic year quantity will be increased to 198 units.  The estimated quantities on the option years will remain the same (50 each). Two first articles were required for this contract.  ARC detectors were to be manufactured in accordance with Specification, ARC Sensing Waveguide Elbow (Attachment 1); Drawing No. 1D20332 (Attachment 2); and Parts List PL1D20332 (Attachment 3), Even though this requirement was competitive only one offer was qualified and able to satisfy the FAA's requirement.  The intent of this announcement is to notify companies that may have previously shown an interest in this requirement of the change in the originally basic year quantity.  All other terms and conditions of the contract remain unchanged.   Any questions shall be in writing and directed to Sheila.dimick.@faa.gov, Contracting Officer, no later than April 14, 2005.

Tasks for this acquisition require detailed knowledge of the Pioneer System design, since production drawings are not available.  Accordingly, as the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the Pioneer UAV, PUI is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the Pioneer design and system architecture.  Award to any one other than PUI would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.  The estimated period of performance is June 2005 to July 2006.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to Michael.Mcloughlin@navy.mil.

The approach requires accurate modeling of the detonation phase and the subsequent aluminum combustion phase, thus improved reaction chemistry concepts are required in a multiphase flow environment.  BYU is uniquely qualified because of research groups that have been at the forefront of solid aluminum combustion and ignition modeling.  The models describing the reaction chemistry with emphasis on aluminum combustion must be compatible with the reaction modeling team headed by the University of Utah.  BYU's models are the only models that hav! e been successfully modeled in the subgrid model schematic involving turbulence and multiphase flow.  Estimated length of contract is 1 basic year with two 1-year options.  Respondents, other than the above, should submit, at a minimum, their qualifications and any other information considered pertinent to the requirement to the Contract Specialist within 30 days after publication of synopsis.  The POC for this requirement is Erin Strand, Contract Specialist at (760) 939-7309 by phone, (760) 939-8329 by fax, or Erin.Strand@navy.mil by electronic mail.

The plan covers approximately 500 employees located in Washington, DC, New York, NY, Chicago, IL, Kansas City, MO, and Minneapolis, MN.

The RFP release date will be on or about April 19, 2005, and will be provided electronically through FedBizOpps’ (FBO) web page as discussed below.  No paper solicitation will be issued.  Interested parties may obtain a copy of the solicitation by accessing the following web page:  http://www.eps.gov.  CFTC posts all required notices of its contracting opportunities on the FBO site.  Potential offerors who download copies of solicitations may register at FBO to automatically receive e-mailed notification concerning issued amendments to the applicable solicitation.  Registration is optional.  You may still view plans/specifications and amendments without registering.  If you register for the solicitation, you will receive a courtesy e-mail from FBO notifying you of all amendments for the solicitation that will be posted to the website.  Registration for the solicitation, however, does not release bidders/offerors from the responsibility of checking the solicitation daily for amendments.  Potential offerors that do not have the capability to download from FBO may request, in writing, diskettes containing electronic copies of the solicitation, including attachments, and any amendments.  Potential offerors making this request must include in their written request an adequate justification for not obtaining the solicitation via the Internet.  Telephone requests for diskettes will be honored, provided a written justification is also furnished.  Requests should be sent to the Contracting Officer by email to wroberson@cftc.gov or by fax to (202)418-5414.  Faxed requests must be preceded by verbal notification to the Contracting Officer.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to ensure it receives the diskettes.  The Government will not be liable for non-receipt of diskettes due to communication errors.  It is anticipated that proposals will be due 30 days after the release date of the RFP.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered.  To be considered a responsible source eligible for award of the anticipated contract, an offeror must currently maintain at least one of the following minimum insurer financial ratings:  A.M. Best: A–; Standard & Poor’s or Fitch: BBB; or Moody’s: Baa2.  If an offeror is rated by more than one of these rating organizations, each rating shall at least meet the above minimums.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The p roject includes the construction of a new pump station, which will be constructed of reinforced cast-in-place concrete. Due to the limited area for construction, steel sheet piles walls will be used for excavation of the pump station and will also provide the exterior formwork for the pump station walls. The pump station will have three storm water pumps @ 5700 GPM each and one dry-weather pump @ 200 GPM.  An electric motor operated sluice gate will be provided on the inlet pipe to the pump station to provi de a secondary means of closure from the river to the storm water collection system.

It is anticipated that two or three subcontracts to U.S. blood centers/blood banks/academic institutions with established collaborative programs with foreign blood centers/blood banks in resource-poor countries where AIDS is highly prevalent will be awarded.  The expected duration of each award is 4 years. Successful offerors (U.S. blood centers/blood banks/academic institutions), together with foreign blood centers/blood banks will serve as blood centers for the international component of REDS-II.  The objectives of REDS-II International Component are to conduct epidemiological, laboratory, and survey research on blood donors aimed at increasing the safety and availability of blood for transfusion in selected resource-limited countries in regions seriously impacted by the AIDS epidemic.  The work scope of the international blood centers will be similar to that for the six blood centers participating in the domestic component of REDS-II.  Offerors must propose studies to be conducted and provide preliminary protocols.  Proposals from U.S. blood centers/blood banks/academic institutions must include evidence to support the following:  
1)  Demonstration of sufficient blood donation collection capability by three or more foreign collaborating blood center/blood bank sites including description of blood donor catchment area and anticipated donation collection rates at each proposed foreign site.  Total annual collections from at least three foreign sites must equal a minimum of 250,000, with each foreign blood center/blood bank site having an annual minimum of 25,000 collections.   Demographic information and screening and confirmatory test data must be routinely collected for all donations.  Data on all donations and donors collected over the course of the contract must be provided to Westat for compilation and analysis. 2)  Description of regional and local population demographics including race/ethnicity and expected blood donor profiles at each of the blood collection sites.  3)  Description of estimated prevalence of HIV-1 and other transfusion-transmitted infectious agents in the blood donor populations to be recruited at each of the foreign blood collecting sites.  4)  Demonstration of capacity to participate in epidemiological, laboratory and survey studies, including having the necessary clinical and laboratory facilities, equipment and instrumentation, specimen and data handling capabilities, and appropriate study personnel at foreign sites.  5)  Demonstration of collaborative experience in working with foreign investigators on issues relating to blood safety and availability.  6) Offerors submitting proposals in response to the REDS-II international blood center RFP must include a statement of willingness to work with the other funded U.S. sites in the preparation of presentations and publications.  REDS-II is a collaborative study, and all publications resulting from study data analysis must be reviewed by NHLBI, and reviewed and approved by the REDS-II Publications Committee prior to publication.  7)  Documentation of governmental approvals to (1) conduct the project in the foreign country; (2) provide donor data on all collections, epidemiologic studies, laboratory studies, and surveys conducted under the contract to Westat; and (3) provide required selected blood specimens to NHLBI.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a sole source contract to LOH Optical using Simplified Acquisition procedures.  The extended warranties will cover the existing LOH Optical equipment for a one year period.  The FSC code is J065 and the NAICS code is 524128.  This office will no longer issue a hard copy of the Request For Quote (RFQ); therefore, a copy can be obtained from website http://www.neco.navy.mil.  By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.  By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this RFQ, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a contractor ineligible for award.  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.bpn.gov.  Numbered notes 22 applies.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the original souces sought.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify: small; small disadvantaged; women-owned; 8(a); HUB Zone and service disabled veteran-owned business concerns that possess the necessary technical capabilities to provide Multi-Media, Multi Concentration Inorganic Sample Analyses for USEPA?s Office of Superfund Remediation Technology Innovation (OSRTI).  The information attained as a result of this announcement will be used to determine the extent to which this acquisition will be set aside for small business concerns. This requirement will satisfy a need for qualified laboratories to apply USEPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) analytical methods for the isolation, detection, quantitative measurement, and reporting of 23 metals (including mercury) and cyanide target analytes in water/aqueous, soil/sediment/wipes, and air environmental samples.  The labs must have the capability to analyze samples by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES), Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption (CVAA), and colorimetric measurement of cyanide.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380. The USEPA intends to award multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contracts with a one-year base period and four 12-month option periods to meet the USEPA?s sample analyses need of 96,000 samples per year. Detailed information on the analytical requirements is provided via the draft Inorganic Low Medium 06.X (ILM06.X) Statement of Work (SOW) and its associated exhibits/appendices which are posted to the following web page: (http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/ilm6.htm).  The ILM SOW is a protocol that will define the inorganic methods and procedures accepted by the CLP.  In addition, the electronic deliverable for the inorganics will be based on staged electronic data deliverable (SEDD) Stage 3.  Although SEDD Stage 3 is not yet completed for the inorganics, the overall structure will be similar to the requirements posted for the organics (http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/som1.htm).  To evaluate the potential number of laboratories capable of adequately performing under the ILM SOW, a thorough review of laboratory capability statements, written Quality Assurance Plan (QAP), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) will be made. Laboratories responding to this sources sought synopsis are requested to provide the USEPA all appropriate documentation that would assure the USEPA that for any possible future contract with the CLP, the laboratory will be able to:  (1) Adhere to a written QAP containing the elements described under Exhibit E, Section 5 of the SOW;  (2) Adhere to SOPs containing the elements described under Exhibit E, Section 6 of the SOW;  (3) Adhere to the analytical methods detailed in Exhibit D and associated QC requirements specified in Exhibit E of the SOW;  (4) Verify and document analytical standards and retain documentation of the purity of neat materials, as well as the purity and accuracy of solutions obtained from private chemical supply houses;  (5) Submit all raw data and required documentation for Regional review;  (6) Submit results of all analyzed laboratory evaluation samples, including adherence to corrective action procedures;  (7) Submit, upon request, instrument data tapes and applicable documentation for tape audits, including a copy of the Sample Data Package;  (8) Submit on-site laboratory evaluations, and adhere to corrective action procedures; and  (9) Submit all original documentation generated during sample analyses for USEPA review. Documentation required to be submitted during the sources sought by each laboratory for evaluation by the USEPA include the following: 1) Quality Assurance Plan.  The laboratory shall submit a written QAP meeting the intent of Exhibit E, Sections 5.1 through 5.1.2 of the SOW.  The QAP shall include all elements detailed in Exhibit E, Section 5.2 of the SOW.  For the purposes of the sources sought announcement, each separate element of the QAP shall be written to detail practices of the laboratory that serve to meet the intent of each specific requirement of the SOW.  All elements required in Section 5.2, Parts A through G must be included in the QAP. 2) Standard Operating Procedures.  The laboratory shall submit written SOPs meeting the intent of Exhibit E, Sections 6.0 through 6.3.12, and Exhibit F, Sections 3.0 through 3.7.2., of the SOW.  Each SOP shall include all elements concerning SOPs detailed in Exhibit E and F of the SOW.  For the purposes of the sources sought announcement, each separate element of the SOP shall detail practices of the laboratory that serve to meet the intent of each specific requirement of the SOW.  All elements required in these Sections must be included in the SOPs. 3) Capabilities Statement Manual.  The laboratory shall submit a written capabilities statement detailing the following:  a. Organizational chart listing key personnel, including section managers, analysts, sample receiving personnel, Quality Assurance staff, and IT personnel that would participate in the performance of a contract under the SOW, and a copy of the job description and/or other documentation outlining the duties and responsibilities of the laboratory Quality Assurance Manager.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, with administrative corrections pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  The administrative correction is as follows:  Update the contracting POC in the body of the announcement.  All previous modifications are incorporated into this republish.  No other changes have been made. 

CONTACT: Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. AFRL/IFEC Program Managers and Technical Points of Contact: Mr. Scott F. Adams, (315) 330-1430, email: Scott.Adams@rl.af.mil; Mr. Richard J. Simard, (315) 330-4104, e-mail: Richard.Simard@rl.af.mil. Introduction: The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and advanced technology development in Digital Data Embedding Technologies (DDET): information hiding, steganography, watermarking, steganalysis, embedded data extraction, digital data forensics, etc. Information hiding and data embedding refer to secure addition of information content to digital data products using mathematical techniques which work at the constructive level of the product. Steganography refers to the use of data embedding for covert communication. Watermarking refers to embedding additional information about the cover data. Steganalysis detects the presence of steganographic communications. Embedded data extraction refers to the extrication of hidden information. Digital data forensics refers to analysis that gathers evidence of data composition, origin, pedigree, etc. The primary digital data types of interest include imagery, video and audio. This program will develop, employ and exploit digital data embedding technologies to provide early demonstrations for potential applications to operational DoD systems. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a vehicle for continued development over its duration. Objective: DDET technologies have shown great potential to contribute to the defense information architecture in the areas of information assurance, authentication, augmentation, and protection. This procurement will assist the government in the technical development of DDET technologies, for evaluation and selection of transitionable technologies, and in prototype demonstrations of these technologies into appropriate systems. These systems could include the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), the Combined Air Operations Center - Experimental (CAOC-X),    systems at the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) and National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC), and/or others as applicable. Technical Background: The Air Force Research Laboratory Multi-Sensor Exploitation Branch has fostered DDET research & development for the past several years. For the most part, this has been done with small university grants, small business and dual use contracts, etc. The results have been widely briefed, well-received, and show great potential for providing many new revolutionary information technologies. Selected advances have begun transition to prototypes, to the extent made possible by funding. It is believed that this PRDA will provide the means to effectively enact accelerated future research, development, test, and evaluation, and ultimately result in more rapid DDET technology insertion.  Innovative DDET Research and Development White Paper Solicitation: AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that provide innovative DDET research and development.  Awards: Multiple awards for the DDET White Paper initiative are anticipated. The principal funding and the anticipated awards as a result of this PRDA will start in 4Q FY02, and will be in the form of contracts, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending on the nature of the work proposed. Contractor teaming is encouraged. Individual awards will normally range from 6 to 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $25,000 to $1,000,000 for basic research and prototype development, and $500,000 to $2,000,000 for advanced technology development and integration efforts. AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA. Deliverables will be technical reports, prototype applications, software and integrated system enhancements and upgrades.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished using the following criteria: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) offerors capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost and fee realism and reasonableness. In addition, the Government will consider other factors such as, past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the described effort. Experience with, and access to, DDET migration systems will be considered when said migration systems are integral to the proposed work. Criteria 1 through 4 above will also be used to determine whether White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government. White paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submittals/awards under this PRDA. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. No minimum facility clearance, safeguarding capability, or personnel clearances are necessary; however, these could be required based upon the offeror's proposed role and contribution.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit an unclassified original plus (3) copies of their White Papers for the DDET PRDA to AFRL/IFEC, ATTN: Scott Adams, Ref. PRDA 02-08-IFKA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505. White Papers are limited to a total page count of ten (10) pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. A softcopy of the white paper in Microsoft Word must also be provided. White Papers must contain a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned small, or HUBZone small business, or a Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution. The White Paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their White Papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). Multiple White Papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.  It is recommended that White Papers be received early in each Fiscal Year to maximize the possibility of award. However, White Papers will be accepted at any time, but it is more likely that funding will be available during the early portion of each Fiscal Year. The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA. Those White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award. White Papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  The total value for all awards under this PRDA shall not exceed $24,000,000. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign allied participation at the prime contractor level is excluded.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY02-30 Jun 2002; FY03-30 Jun 2003; FY04-30 Jun 2004: FY05-30 Jun 2005.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each fiscal year after the dates cited.  This PRDA is open and effective until 30 September 2006.  A copy of the AFRL/IFK publication, "BAA & PRDA: a Guide For Industry", Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  All responsible firms may submit proposals or White Papers, as appropriate, which shall be considered. Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 02-08-IFKA. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>Question 1: What is meant by total small business set-aside? Does it mean that 100% of the work has to be performed by personnel from the small business firm? Total small business set-aside means that this will result in award to a small business firm. This means that as long as a small business is performing 51% of the work it is still identified as a small business set-aside.

<DESC>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S Government.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  No award will be made as a result of this market research. 

The USMC H-1 helicopter program, PMA-276, is seeking sources to replace the current Helmet Mounted Heads Up Display System (HUDS) for the UH-1N and AH-1W helicopters.  NAVAIR and PMA-276 recognize that the current systems installed on the aircraft limit the pilots’ capabilities.  In order to reduce these limitations, NAVAIR is considering a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) of a HUDS.  NAVAIR is requesting responses from sources that have an item developed or nearly developed for possible testing in addition to the FCT.  The ultimate goal of NAVAIR and the FCT program is to procure the item that best meets the user needs.   

The current systems installed on the aircraft are the AN/AVS-7 on the UH-1N and the GIDEON on the AH-1W.  These systems provide information for navigation, performance, and targeting during night operations for both pilot crew stations in each aircraft.  Neither the AN/AVS-7 nor the GIDEON provides assistance for landing in very low visibility conditions. 

NAVAIR is seeking to replace these systems with a HUDS that is common to both the UH-1N and AH-1W.  This system shall provide increased information to all pilot crew stations during both the day and night operations, to include assistance when landing in very low visibility conditions.  

NAVAIR requests that companies respond by submitting 1) a summary outline of the performance specification of the proposed HUDS system, and 2) any other information as determined by the vendor, limited to 20 printed pages.   The Government will not be responsible for preparation costs. Submissions will not be returned.

Written and/or electronic media responses to this announcement must be received no later than 18 April 2005 and can be submitted to:

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify: small; small disadvantaged; women-owned; 8(a); HUB Zone and service disabled veteran-owned business concerns that possess the necessary technical capabilities to provide Multi-Media, Multi Concentration Inorganic Sample Analyses for USEPA?s Office of Superfund Remediation Technology Innovation (OSRTI).  The information attained as a result of this announcement will be used to determine the extent to which this acquisition will be set aside for small business concerns. This requirement will satisfy a need for qualified laboratories to apply USEPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) analytical methods for the isolation, detection, quantitative measurement, and reporting of 23 metals (including mercury) and cyanide target analytes in water/aqueous, soil/sediment/wipes, and air environmental samples.  The labs must have the capability to analyze samples by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES), Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption (CVAA), and colorimetric measurement of cyanide.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380.

<CONTACT>DIANNA MCGINLEY, Contract Specialist, (973)724-4423
<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, Picatinny, NJ in support of the Project Manager for Close Combat Systems is issuing this market survey Research & Development Sources Sought notice to identify potential sources for the Intelligent Munitions System (IMS) program as it prepares to move from the Technology Development (TD) Phase to the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase with a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) option(s). IMS is being developed as an evolutionary acquisition in an incremental approach.  The Increment 1 system, of which the SDD phase applies, is being developed to support the U.S. Landmine Policy to field a replacement capability for the existing family of non-self-destructing landmines.  The Increment 1 system will support the Future Combat Systems (FCS) Spiral-Out plan to field FCS technology earlier to the Current Force.  All companies responding must adhere to the U.S. Landmine Policy. The Army is interested in determining if there is an existing system (non-developmental item) capable of meeting the IMS requirements, or if there is a contractor capable of meeting the SDD and LRIP requirements of the program. The system must meet the following key capabilities (1) Operate with Current Force Battle Command and available FCS network; (2) Interface radio to allow connectivity to Army Battle Command; (3) Dispensing module – 35 meter field; dispense on command; precision hand emplaced; lethal anti-vehicle, anti- ersonnel effects; (4) hardened components that are form-factored for remote delivery; (5) able to interface with FCS platform; (6) able to control the XM155 Spider Munition Control Units.  The primary objectives of the SDD phase will be to mature the design approach into a stable, interoperable, producible, supportable and cost effective design; validate the manufacturing/production process; and demonstrate system capabilities through testing.  The LRIP phase will commence at the conclusion of the SDD phase with the results of the tests and design fixes incorporated into the LRIP systems. To comply with the timelines stipulated in the U.S. Landmine Policy an Initial Operational Capability is scheduled for Government fiscal year 2009.  The Government intends to limit the solicitation to the two contractors that have performed the TD Phase of IMS.  The proposed acquisition strategy is to have a single system contractor responsible for the entire system development and initial production. This notice is for planning purposes only.  This is not a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  See Numbered Notes 8 and 26. There will not be any Request for Proposal (RFP) issued as a result of this notice, nor will the Government pay for any information received.  Interested parties are requested to provide adequate information to substantiate that their product/capability meets the Army's requirements.  Firms should provide a summary of their company’s technical and manufacturing capabilities including a description of facilities, personnel and past experience to meet this requirement.  If this information is not adequate to substantiate that the requirements are met, the Government reserves the right to request additional information.  No basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of this notice or Government use of information received as a result of this notice.  The Government reserves the right to reject in whole, or part, any industry input as a result of this notice. All responses must include company name, address, POC, phone number, fax number, email address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number and CAGE code.  Submittal of information is requested via electronic mail to Dianna McGinley at   dmcgin@pica.army.mil and/or hardcopy to: U.S. Army TACOM-Picatinny, ATTN: AMSTA-AQ-APA/D. McGinley, Bldg. 10, Picatinny, NJ 07806- 5000 by 15 Apr 05.

<SUBJECT>B--Single Source Solicitation
<DESC>By way of this notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and FAR 13.106-1(b), the National Park Service, Midwest Archeological Center, announces its intent to award a single source solicitation to Steve Rolfsmeier, 411 W. Seventh Street, Chadron, Nebraska.  Mr. Rolfsmeier will prepare reports on the community description and restoration plan for the Bur Oak Woodland Project at Homestead National Monument of America, Beatrice, Nebraska.   In 2002, during a site visit to Homestead, Mr. Rolfsmeier determined that the forest community at the Monument best fits the mesic bur oak description.   In May, 2004, the Monument hosted a Vegetation Management planning meeting in which was decided that the best course of action for the woodland at the Monument was to restore it back to its natural community type.

<SUBJECT>72 -- FPI Sales in FSC Code 7210 - Updated
<DESC>On October 2, 2003, Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) posted a notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) regarding a decision by the FPI Board of Directors to waive FPI’s status as a mandatory source of supply for items within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 7210 – Household Furnishings.  This notice clarifies the language in the original notice.  FPI will continue to produce items within FSC code 7210, however, all sales FPI obtains for those items will be through non-mandatory means.  This decision was effective on October 2, 2003.  This decision was the result of an earlier resolution by FPI’s Board to limit the application of FPI’s mandatory source to products for which FPI’s share of the Federal market is less than 20 percent.

Mandatory source is prescribed by law.  In the past, the Board has exercised its authority to administratively determine how the statute should be applied.  It is within the Board’s authority to determine the conditions under which waivers of FPI’s mandatory source are to be applied. The following guidance is being provided to facilitate the customer implementation of this action.

	&#8729;	For products where FPI has waived the application of mandatory source, the market share acquired by FPI without the benefit of the mandatory source is considered a reasonable share.

	&#8729;	For those FSCs where FPI’s mandatory source is waived, FPI must be given full visibility of the requirement and afforded a fair and equitable opportunity to submit an offer to meet the customer’s requirement, to include being provided by Federal agencies the same information and specifications (as are afforded to any private sector offeror).

	&#8729;	Such waiver is contingent upon FPI’s ability to submit an offer for these procurements.  Thus, consistent with the provisions of the Interim Rule Implementing  Sections 811/819 of the Defense Authorization Act of 2003 (Federal Register, November 14, 2003), such procurements must not be set aside for other programs, e.g., small business set-aside, nor may FPI be otherwise precluded from being able to submit an offer.

	&#8729;	Notwithstanding the fact that customers are no longer  required to purchase products from FPI as a result of the Board resolution waiving FPI’s mandatory source for products in which FPI has less than a 20 percent market share, there is absolutely no restriction or prohibition against the customers continuing to purchase from FPI, should they choose to do so of their own volition.  Thus, customers that currently rely on FPI to meet their product needs may continue to utilize FPI under the Board’s resolution.

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI’s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.  Attention:  FPI Board of Directors.

(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designed for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 		(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.  Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

(3) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. 		(4) A summary of the rationale for award. 		(5) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.

(End of provision) 52.212-2   	EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS  (JAN 1999) Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between offerss that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror. 	(b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 	(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is NOT set aside for small business.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Offer (RFO) for: Item 1) one Pick and Place System, Item 2) one installation and checkout of Item 1 and Item 3) Training for 2 people to operate Item 1.  Project Background The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has a requirement for a die bonder (also known as a pick & place machine). A pick & place machine is used to select various electronic chips from several styles of containers and then precisely install them onto a large wafer or work-piece using some type of conductive or non-conductive adhesive. The pick & place machine shall be used to support the assembly of several phased array antennas currently under development at GRC.   Statement of Work The Contractor shall provide a turn-key pick & place system that consists of all the servo mechanisms (X, Y, Z and Theta axis), vision systems (CCD camera, optics, and illumination) for inspection and pattern recognition, adhesive dispenser systems, computer and Windows based graphical user interface, and substrate handling systems to meet, as a minimum, the following specifications.  1.	Capability to handle wafer (work-piece) sizes up to 33 cm in diameter. That is, the various die will be placed and bonded to a surface that may be up to 33 cm in diameter. 2.	The machine must be able to handle die sizes ranging from 0.2 mm up to 2 cm on a side. 3.	The machine shall be able to handle die thicknesses ranging from 0.1 mm up to 2.5 mm. 4.	The X-Y +/- 3 sigma placement accuracy shall be 10 microns or better. 5.	The machine shall be capable of placing two die, each up to 1 cm on an edge, adjacent to one another to within a 25 micron spacing. 6.	The machine shall have a wafer mapping ability to reject unwanted die. For example, individual die will be screened and left on the wafer saw tape. Rejected die can be identified by location on the tape. The machine must ignore these identified rejected die during the pick & place process. 7.	The machine shall be capable of placing a parasitic (i.e. overlay) die onto a previously placed and bonded die with a +/- 3 sigma theta accuracy of 0.15 degrees. 8.	The machine shall be able to dispense conductive and non-conductive adhesives, including superglue (i.e. cyanoacrylate). For example, the parasitic die mentioned in specification #6 must be attached with superglue. 9.	The machine shall be able to bond multiple die sizes (A, B, C) automatically. For example, the anticipated process involves placing hundreds of die type A using a conductive epoxy, hundreds of die type B adjacent to die type A using a conductive epoxy, then bonding die type C atop die type A using superglue. 10.	The machine shall be capable of selecting die from various carrier types, including waffle packs, GEL-PAKs, and Nitto tape. 11.	The dispenser shall be able to pattern different adhesive trace and spot size designs, consistent with die dimensions given in # 2 above, to prevent adhesive from wicking up the die sides and potentially shorting components. 12.	A chip needle ejector system shall be able to handle the various die sizes specified in # 2 and # 3 above. 13.	One set of operation manuals shall be furnished with the system. Those offerors whose system meets the above minimum requirements shall perform the following demonstration within one week from notification in order for their system to be considered:   Samples (coupons) will be provided by NASA GRC to the offerors with instructions. These coupons will be functionally equivalent to the die and wafer process to be used by NASA for assembly of the phased array antennas. The offeror shall satisfactorily demonstrate the die bonding process according to the instructions given using the proposed machine. NASA will evaluate the assembled coupons prior to any determination or selection for award. Within 2 weeks of delivery, the Contractor shall install the pick and place system at NASA Glenn Research Center and demonstrate functionality according to the above specifications.  Installation and checkout shall be performed Monday thru Friday, non-government holidays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. or per other mutually agreeable times. The Contractor shall furnish training in the safe operation of the system either at GRC or at the Contractor's facility for up to five days and for up to two persons within 30 days of delivery of the system. Schedule The Contractor shall perform all of these tasks within 12 weeks from contract award.	 Solicitation Instructions The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-25. The NAIC code is 334419 and the small business size standard for this procurement is 500 employees. All qualified responsible business sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to NASA Glenn Research Center is required within 12 weeks from contract award.

Consideration will given to the factors of meeting specifications, total price, and past performance. (Offerors shall provide a summary of their firm that includes how many years they have furnished the same or similar product required and the number of units sold in the last 2 years.) Other critical requirements (i.e., delivery) if so stated in the solicitation and best value will also be considered. Unless otherwise stated in the solicitation, for selection purposes past performance, delivery schedule, meeting specifications, and total price, and are essentially equal in importance.  Best Value will be an important consideration in selection.  Technical acceptability will be determined by information submitted by the offeror providing a description in sufficient detail to show that the product offered meets the Government's requirement (see specifications above); those that meet the specifications will be required to demonstrate the die bonding process according to Government instructions using the proposed machine with Government furnished coupons, and any best value criteria the offeror wishes to address. It is critical that offerors provide adequate detail to allow evaluation of their offer. (SEE FAR 52.212-1(b) and its amendment above).  Best Value Criteria: The following will be BVC considerations:	  1.  The pick & place machine will be installed in a small laboratory with similar equipment. Because of floor space and load limitations, special consideration will be given to a machine that has a minimal footprint (i.e. that occupies the smallest possible volume and uses the least amount of floor space).   2.  The pick & place machine will be used to assemble, among other things, phased array antennas. Three antennas are currently under development: an X-band receive array, A K-band 615 element transmit array, and a 26.5 GHz transmit array. Because the development schedule of each array imposes stringent milestones, special consideration will be given to early delivery and installation of the system.   3.  Training that is provided at NASA GRC may be considered a better value than that performed at another location.	  3.  An offeror that can demonstrate that the proposed equipment is successfully used by industry or Government for the purposes outlined in the work statement will be given best value consideration.  (I.e a system demonstrated to be commercially available equipment that can meet the specifications with minimal modifications and has been sold within the last year.) 4.  The offeror shall satisfactorily demonstrate the die bonding process according to instructions using the proposed machine. NASA will evaluate the coupons and those machines providing for functionally equivalency closest to the die and wafer process to be used by NASA for assembly of the phased array antennas will be given best value consideration. Questions regarding this acquisition must be submitted in writing no later than 2 days after the posting date of this notice.  Ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the following Internet site for the release of solicitation amendments (if any):  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=22  .  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of this combination synopsis/solicitation and amendments (if any).
