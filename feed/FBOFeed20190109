<DESC>Description:<br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. AN RFP WILL BE ISSUED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON OR ABOUT January 23, 2019.  This will be a 100% total small business set-aside IDIQ Task Order contract.
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is the lead Federal agency for the conduct of basic, clinical and epidemiologic research to develop new contraceptives and to evaluate existing methods of contraception and reproductive health. The Center for Population Research (CPR), within NICHD, was established in 1968 by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, (formally Department of Health, Education and Welfare), with the important goal of developing new contraceptives using contracts and grants. Under the CPR mission, the Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) supported preclinical contraceptive testing facilities as well as facilities for chemical and peptide synthesis.  To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996, CDB established the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) consisting of a Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center (SCCC) and 8 sites highly qualified to evaluate new contraceptive methods for women. The initial CCTN did not have any sites dedicated to male contraception. In 2004, the network was expanded through a competitive RFP, and sites for male contraceptive development were added. In 2013, the CCTN was again recompeted and expanded to 19 sites for female contraceptive evaluation and 2 sites for male contraception.  In 2017, the NICHD established the Contraceptive Development Program (CDP) as a component of the Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR), with the mission to develop and evaluate new methods of contraception for women and men through the CCTN.  As of 2018, the CCTN has completed 24 clinical trials including Phase I, II and III trials on novel female contraceptive methods and Phase I and II trials on male contraceptive methods. In addition, there are eight actively enrolling clinical trials, three of which began enrollment in 2018.</p>
<p>This procurement is for the recompetition of the SCCC to provide the support for the new CCTN as described below.  The CCTN conducts Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new female or male contraceptive methods. With the recompetition of the CCTN, contractors with the capability and experience of coordinating and monitoring both female and male contraceptive trials will be sought.  Experience in protocol development for new chemical entities to evaluate male contraception or female contraception is a critical element, including expertise related to the regulatory requirements associated with transition from preclinical to first in human studies as well as the requirements for evaluation of products in Phase I, II and III trials.  For large capacity trials, it may be necessary and desirable to expand to international sites, therefore experience in working with other regulatory agencies is valuable. The network will consist of up to 19 sites focused on female contraceptive clinical research and up to 9 sites focused on male clinical research, therefore the SCCC must have capability to coordinate and monitor both small and large clinical trials of investigational drugs or devices for male or female contraception.</p>
<p>The goal of the NICHD's CCTN is to systematically evaluate the safety and efficacy of new or existing female and male contraceptive drugs and devices as well as treatments of selected gynecologic conditions in Phase I, II, III and IV trials conducted under Good Clinical Practices guidelines. The results of these clinical trials on new entities would be the basis for advancing candidate drugs and devices through clinical development with the ultimate goal of submission to the FDA in support of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and initiation of New Drug Application (NDA) for a new drug for male or female contraception; and for a device, Premarket notification 510K, Premarket approval (PMA), and Investigation Device Exemption (IDE). The goal of this contract is to obtain the necessary technical support and services needed by the NICHD and the CCTN sites, such as the development of research protocols, on-site monitoring of clinical trials, the statistical analysis of data from these trials, the development of IND applications, NDAs, Premarket notifications 510K, PMAs, IDEs and other ancillary services, in order to successfully achieve the goals of the CCTN.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide support and services to the CCTN and NICHD for a variety of tasks related to the development and conduct of clinical trials of male and female contraceptive products under Good Clinical Practices guidelines, as well as to provide ancillary services for the trials, such as product formulation, packaging, distribution, insurance and stability testing.  Additional services supporting clinical evaluation and regulatory approval of candidate entities will be provided as needed for individual products.</p>
<p>The general requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>1.	Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government under the terms of this contract as needed to provide statistical and clinical coordination and conduct of contraceptive clinical trials. Trials may involve male or female contraceptive drugs or devices in Phase I, II, III or IV of clinical evaluation.</p>
<p>2.	Participate in study design of concept plans and protocols in collaboration with the NICHD COR, NICHD MO, and the Principal Investigators of the CCTN sites. Provide draft protocol and draft protocol amendments for each study. Develop draft informed consent documents that are consistent with government regulations. Coordinate site submissions to comply with submission to a single IRB for multi-site clinical trials.</p>
<p>3.	Design data collection instruments and coordinate all data management and data analysis aspects of the trials. Ensure FISMA compliance (21 CFR Part 11).</p>
<p>4.	Monitor, coordinate and conduct contraceptive clinical trials for novel male contraceptive or female contraceptive products. The Contractor shall monitor each clinical trial and shall maintain records in accordance with current FDA regulations and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines. Information on current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations applicable to clinical trials and ICH GCP guidelines can be found at the following Web site:</p>
<p>ICH: 	https://www.ich.org/home.html&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FDA: 	http://www.fda.gov/</p>
<p>5.	Monitor training of clinical site personnel and quality assurance of data collected in clinical studies.</p>
<p>6.	Coordinate tracking of laboratory specimens as required for specific studies, ensure that all protocol-specified laboratory tests are completed, and that the results are accurately reported as specified in the applicable Task Order.</p>
<p>7.	Prepare Clinical Study Reports of clinical trials in a manner acceptable to FDA and equivalent stringent regulatory agencies for drugs, including initiation and maintenance of IND applications and NDAs; and, for devices, 510K Premarket notifications, PMAs, and IDEs.</p>
<p>8.	Provide ancillary services to assist in the organization or acquisition of materials and services required to conduct contraceptive clinical trials or provide clinical data. Such services might include drug or device procurement, drug formulation (including encapsulation), drug packaging, distribution, facilities for central lab and stability testing, consultants for histology or pathology, etc., as required for a specific study. Where IND holders do not have product liability insurance, the SCCC may be required to assist in the acquisition of such insurance.</p>
<p>9.	Work in close collaboration with the clinical sites, laboratory contractors, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board and the Scientific Consulting Group to assist NICHD in coordinating activities of the network.</p>
<p>As a result of this announcement, the NICHD anticipates awarding a single cost reimbursement IDIQ type contract with an ordering period of seven (7) years. The NICHD anticipates the Request for Proposals (RFP) for this study will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/) on or about January 23, 2019.  Proposals will be due approximately March 20, 2019.

For the Government to identify and evaluate another system, perform the field testing of the equipment, produce the required SHIPALT records and drawings, produce all of the required support documentation, and schedule ships for equipment installation and other tasks is estimated at a cost of $125,000 in development and installation costs and would exceed two years. The development costs are derived from the development, prototyping, Engineering Development Models (EDMs), design of adjacent parts for fitting and operating the part, and testing - totaling 125,000. Most of these costs were borne by the development program in the 1980's. The two-year time estimate was derived from the amount of time which was required by Naval Coastal Systems Center to perform these identical tasks. Est. $56,000, FOB Origin.</p>

The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided. This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation. The applicable NAICS code for this notice is 541715. <br /><br />The Program Executive Office, Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives (PEO ACWA) is responsible for destroying the remainder of the United States' chemical weapons stockpiles at both the U.S. Army Pueblo Chemical Depot in Pueblo, Colorado and at the Blue Grass Army Depot (BGAD) in Richmond, Kentucky. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA) Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program supports the national security strategy to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to include, chemical warfare materiel. In addition, the PEO Armaments and Ammunition (PEO - A&amp;A) is responsible for destruction and disposal of conventional high explosive (HE) munitions and is seeking high throughput, transportable options to achieve its demilitarization mission. The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) has the mission and experience to develop and test Government and commercial technologies that destroy chemical warfare materiel. Together, these four (4) organizations share a common goal to seek new and innovative ways to demilitarize chemical and conventional weapons safely and effectively.
<p><br />The JPEO - CBRND, and associated stakeholders, have a requirement to conduct market research for state-of-the-art technologies capable of destroying Chemical Warfare Material (CWM) filled munitions at a greater throughput than currently existing transportable CWM demilitarization systems developed and/or tested by the U.S. Army to date. The JPEO-CBRND is seeking existing transportable systems that are capable of processing chemical weapons and conventional weapons at a throughput requirement of 1000 lbs./hr. for conventional weapons.</p>

The ALE family will support interchangeable payloads including capabilities to: 1) detect, identify, locate, report and share information on enemy threats, 2) act as a decoy, 3) disrupt through Electronic Warfare, Cyber effects or other methods and 4) preemptively destroy enemy systems via a kinetic engagement capability. Payloads may be both recoverable and non-recoverable with one or more payloads per ALE to maximize the combination of effects needed for mission success. The software and hardware will be common, open, modular and scalable. The interfaces to the launcher, air vehicles, sensors and command and control links allow for integration of a common mission computer to enable common behaviors across ALE variants. ALE use artificial intelligence, operate semi-autonomously and will implement the commanders intent through collaboration with other team members. They will not have continuous or near continuous data links to the host platform.</p>
<p>ALE are launched from Army unmanned aircraft systems, manned helicopter fleets and may also be alternatively deployed in support of long range precision fires and ground combat vehicles via a variety of surface based launch systems such as common launch tube, artillery, mortars or shoulder fired systems. Some ALE variants should be capable of launching and operating below 150ft AGL while others may be launched from higher altitudes.</p>
<p>Launching a minimum of four (4) ALE from the AH-64 Apache at hover below 150ft Above Ground Level (AGL) and four (4) ALE from the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS above 10,000ft AGL is a short term demonstration goal for PM UAS. ALE should be sized appropriately for carriage and launch from the host platform airframe and support planned mission ranges of greater than 50 kilometers. Ejecting the ALE to the rear is not possible on MQ-1C Gray Eagle due to a high likelihood of striking the rear tails of the aircraft during separation. Ejecting from the rear may be feasible on other aircraft. Description of safety during launch should be described in any responses. The ALE product's electrical, mechanical, and logical interfaces prior to launch and data communications before and after launch should be described in detail. This includes, but is not limited to, data transfer rate requirements. The ALE should be mechanically compatible with either the: <br />a) M299/M310 HELLFIRE (HF) Launcher using the M299 Launcher Electronics Assembly (LEA) When using the M299 HF rail, the ALE should mount as either a slide-on or rail-adapter mounted payload using the M299 shotgun connector and MIL-STD-1553 interface not to exceed 125 lbs. per HF rail.<br />b) 14-inch lug NATO bomb ejector racks and MIL-STD-1760 platform interface. When mounted via a 14-inch lug, such as the MA-4B lightweight electro-mechanical ejector rack, the ALE/launcher should conform to MIL-STD-8591 for the physical interface and not exceed 250 lbs. per outer wing hard-point and 500 lbs. per inner wing hard-point locations.</p>
<p>Security Requirements: Responders must be eligible for a COMSEC account and demonstrate the ability to maintain National Information Security Program standards. Security requirements for any resultant contract will be a facility cleared to the Secret level with authorization to store COMSEC items and individuals with clearance eligibility to the Secret level. A sufficient number of individuals will require access to COMSEC. Potential solutions sought shall have full National Security Agency (NSA) approved Type-1 and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) level encryption capability.</p>
<p>Responses: Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper, no more than 10 pages in length, describing the responder's capabilities and potential material/services solution that meets the criteria referenced in this document. The whitepaper should include what is available for a demonstration within a year, what will be available within five years, and what will be available long term (after 2028). The whitepaper should also include, at a minimum, the interfaces, size, weight, payload, rough order of magnitude cost and power requirements of the ALE. Responses are due no later than 25 January 2019, 5:00 PM CST.</p>
<p>Contracts Points of Contact (POC): Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Carolyn.j.gates2.civ@mail.mil. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The Government does not guarantee that questions received after 25 January 2019 will be answered.</p>

<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 813110 (Small Business Administration Size Standard: $7,500,000 annually). <br /><br /><strong>Draft Statement of Work</strong></p>
<p>Background<br />In September 2000, the Executive Staff of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) approved a concept which would initiate a multi-faith residential reentry program. This is a voluntary program which is located in five institutions in various regions of the country. The program is available to male and female inmates.</p>
<p>The program provides inmates with intensive opportunities for spiritual growth and deepening their religious roots by sharing common space and programs for the purpose of personal transformation and reducing recidivism. Inmates will participate in religion specific and inter-faith program components designed to bring restoration with God, family, community, and self. The program's design will increase religious tolerance and respect among inmates of various faiths; will connect each inmate with a spiritual mentor; and will link participants with a faith community at their release destination in order to enhance community reintegration. Another component of the program will initiate specific victim impact programs to assist inmates in claiming responsibility for their actions and making amends with victims, family, and community.</p>
<p>The program enlists partnerships with individuals and organizations in its efforts to lower recidivism and facilitate spiritual growth and personal change. Volunteers, contractors, mentors, sponsoring religious congregations and organizations are all essential partners in the program.</p>
<p>The goal of the BOP residential Life Connections Program (LCP) is to provide inmates living in a shared living space with intensive opportunities for holistic life restoration for the purpose of reducing recidivism and enhancing prison management.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the correctional setting, delays in performance of work may be experienced. Such delays may include but are not limited to inclement weather, electrical or mechanical problems, or other security matters. When contract employees report to the institution but are unable to perform services due to such delays, the contractor will be paid for one session. Normally, any remaining sessions for that day will be suspended and the contractor will be free to leave and the contractor will not be paid for the remaining unperformed sessions. However, if the institution requests that the contractor remain at the institution for eventual performance, the contractor shall be paid for such sessions. In the event of any absence, the contractor may make up his/her time if approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). If the contractor fails to provide coverage, the Government may seek contractual remedy.</p>

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /> <br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability and type of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting this potential government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.   Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method including small business socio-economic set-aside possibilities and to determine the availability of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting the Government's potential requirement.  All Small Business companies with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with size standard 1000 employees.<br /> <br />BACKGROUND<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>The Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program at NCATS supports pre-clinical development of therapeutic candidates intended to treat rare or neglected disorders, with the goal of enabling Investigational New Drug (IND) candidates. TRND projects are selected based on their potential to move forward into human trials and transform patient care for rare and neglected diseases. Each project has the potential for success and ability to teach important lessons about rare and neglected disease drug development.</p>
<p>The TRND biology program's mission is to encourage and speed the development of new treatments for diseases with high-unmet medical needs.

While SDVOSB/VOSB contractors are preferred, all capable contractors are welcome to respond to this source sought notice for market research purposes, and shall include as part of their response a brief capability statement that covers the information in the following tentative statement of work.
The results of this market research will assist in the development of (1) the requirement, and (2) the acquisition strategy (e.g., socioeconomic set-aside, full and open competition, etc.).  VA assumes no responsibility for any costs incurred associated with the preparation of responses. This sources sought will accept any recommendations for Product Service Code or NACIS codes.

Scope: 
The Wilmington Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Delaware provides medical services to both inpatient, acute care Veterans and to a Community Living Center(CLC).  The licensed bed capacity for acute care is 24 beds and the CLC is a 40-bed unit.  The Nutrition and Food Service department operates on a Room Service dining model where food is made to order.  The CLC has a grill area where meals are cooked to order for Veterans.  Given the census capacity and the need for smaller, fresh produce multiple times during the week, the Nutrition Service is seeking a produce vendor.  Preferably, the vendor would be local to the area to promote sustainable ingredients, no further than 30 miles from the Wilmington VA Medical Center.  This contract, or purchasing agreement, will be effective for ordering by March 1, 2019 and ending September 30, 2019.  The contract, or purchasing agreement, will be effective for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 with the ability to option or extend for the next four fiscal years.  Fiscal years begin on October 1 and end September 30 the following year.  The vendor will need the ability to deliver in all weather conditions three days per week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  The delivery must be received between the hours of 6am-10am.  Deliveries will arrive at the facility docking station and be transported into the main kitchen immediately off the dock.  Product will be inspected by the inventory specialist at the medical center.  Any product not meeting food quality and safety standards will be returned to the vendor on delivery for full credit.  


Requirements: 
The vendor would be required to stock organic and top-grade produce, supporting products for selection by the Wilmington VA.  The vendor would also be required to offer a base selection of items all year, in addition to seasonal produce and supporting products like readymade salads, lettuce blends at a minimum.  For example, cucumbers are needed all year, so the vendor would need to stock.  Watermelon would be an example of a seasonal food.  
The vendor would be required to deliver needed items in a timely manner on delivery days, before 9am in sanitary pallets or containers to the Nutrition Services department, back door storage area.  The vendor will need to be located within 30 miles of the Wilmington VA Medical Center to ensure quality of the produce and to maintain food safety.  The deliveries must be made in a refrigerated truck for the same rationale.  Any produce that is not meeting the standards specified in the item list will be rejected with accurate financial credit back to the hospital. All pricing will be remaining consistent unless there is a contract change order.   The Wilmington VA would also want a vendor who could deliver on weekends and holidays in an emergency.  The vendor will need the ability to deliver in all weather conditions three days per week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  The delivery must be received between the hours of 6am-10am.  Deliveries will arrive at the facility docking station and be transported into the main kitchen immediately off the dock.  Product will be inspected by the inventory specialist at the medical center.  Any product not meeting food quality and safety standards will be returned to the vendor on delivery for full credit.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. 
The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors, who are able to meet Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements for transition of Data Network services.  Any contract/order that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of the competitive process.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information on capable sources of supply, industry practices, and input specific to the information provided.  The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in furnishing this information.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested contractors expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal (RFP), if one is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this acquisition is 517311.  The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS code is 1500 employees $27.5M.  Please indicate your company size and socio-economic status under this NAICS. 
The goal of this RFI is to identify businesses with the capability to support the VA's data networking requirements, with services at all locations. 
VA maintains a complex Information Technology (IT) infrastructure that supports approximately 360,000 VA staff nationwide. These employees oversee and facilitate VA IT product and service delivery activities to over 21 million Veterans. IT is integrated across 152 Medical Centers, 300 Vet Centers, 820 Community-Based Outpatient Clinics, 135 VA Community Living Centers, 6 Independent Output Clinics, 104 Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation Centers, 231 National and State Cemeteries, and 56 Regional Offices. VA owns and manages most of the infrastructure that it supports. Its vast technology profile includes over 424,000 desktop computers, 69,000 laptops, 60,000 mobile devices, and 539,000 email accounts. VA s network is federated, with each region being a Wide Area Network (WAN) connected by a VA backbone network. The VA is transforming its network into a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network providing any-to-any connectivity. The project is in flight and has a completion timeframe of summer 2019.
The Contractor shall provide a like-for-like transition of all Networx Data services to a new contract vehicle award.  The like-for-like transition means that where a technology exists today, it will transition to a like technology provided by the Contractor. For example, if there is a T1 carrier service existing it will be transitioned with the same T1 carrier service. If there is an MPLS circuit, it will be transitioned for a like MPLS circuit.

The Flight School Next services contract will require: <br /> <br />a. State of the Art Visual Systems and Displays.<br /> b. Operational Flight Program (OFP) Concurrency.<br /> AH-64D v13.3, v14.0 <br /> AH-64E  v4.0<br /> UH-60M v4.0<br /> CH-47F v9.4, Block II<br /> c. State of the Art Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) for Reconfigurable Training Devices (RCTDs).<br /> d. Aviation Survivability Equipment (ASE).<br /> e. Improved Data Modem (IDM).<br /> f.  OneSAF Currency (RCTD).<br /> g. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Levels of Interoperability (LOI) 1 thru 4:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (1) LOI 1 is indirect receipt of UASV payload data. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (2) LOI 2 is when the pilot has direct receipt of UASV payload data and is in direct communication with the UASV. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (3) LOI 3 is where the Apache pilot can actually fire a UASV missile. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (4) LOI 4 turns flight control over to the Apache pilot.<br /> h.  Air Traffic Controller (ATC) Training Services.</p>
<p>These training services must be ready for training NLT 30 March 2023.  Services must be provided within a 10 mile radius of Ft. Rucker, AL, and they must be available M-F, 0600-2000 daily; including an ability to support training surge requirements of ten percent.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The mission of the USAACE at Ft. Rucker, AL is to train and prepare helicopter pilots for combat operations. All USAACE flight school pilot trainees undergo intensive training, consisting of both academic instruction and direct individual skills development on training simulators, at the basic and the advanced training levels.</p>
<p>Currently, simulation services for FSXXI are provided under a competitively awarded, best-value, long-term (19.5 year period of performance (POP)), single award, requirements contract.  This contract provides simulation services for TH-67 and UH-72A Training Helicopter Virtual Simulators; UH-60A/L, UH-60M, and CH-47F Advanced Aircraft Virtual Simulators; and UH-60M, AH-64D/E, and CH47F Reconfigurable Collective Training Devices (RCTD). Additionally, it provides a training support/management oversight capability. Each simulator training device is owned, operated and maintained by the contractor. The number, type, functionality, fidelity and availability of the flight simulators meet the needs of student loads, training schedules, and individual/crew and collective training requirements prescribed by the USAACE.</p>
<p>ACQUISITION APPROACH: The current FSXXI contract period of performance ends on 31 March 2023. The various acquisition strategy courses of action (COA) have been identified, and evaluated to determine the best course of action in providing for a seamless continuation of simulation capabilities that will support USAACE's future annual throughput of approximately 3,900 flight students.</p>
<p>As a result of industry feedback to two Requests for Information and One-On-One Sessions, the Government discerned that industry partners believed major modifications or new requirements in the scope of effort would be necessary in order to be competitive.  Additionally, industry desired a 20-year POP in order to recoup the large, up front capital investment required to build and house various simulators.</p>
<p>The Government has determined that 12-years for what will be called "FSXXI Next" is the minimum timeline necessary to create the conditions for a competitive follow-on contract that will be awarded in FY2035. At that time, major aircraft requirement changes resulting from the need to develop brand new simulator devices to enable training in the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) aircraft and potential large scale paradigm shifts in virtual training through the advancement and integration of Synthetic Training Environment (STE) will enable greater competition between interested industry partners. The anticipated initial operational capability (IOC) for these programs is anticipated to be around FY2030 which will provide ample time for FSXXI to develop updated requirements in preparation for a full and open competition.</p>
<p>Industry's desire to award a 20-year contract does not align with the FVL and STE IOC scheduled for FY2030, which is why a sole-source 12-year POP would allow time for the integration of FVL and STE, thereby creating the ideal environment for future contract competition.</p>
<p>Based on extensive market research and communications with industry, the Government intends to pursue a 12-year sole-source contract award to the incumbent contractor.  This course of action achieves the lowest evaluated Cost Benefit Index, reduces cost, schedule and performance risk to the Government and establishes the environment for a full and open competition, anticipated in FY2035.</p>
<p>NOTICE: This notice is being provided to alert industry of potential subcontracting opportunities. The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government, would not be cost or time prohibitive, and would not hinder the mission. The Government will consider all responses received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 24 January 2019.   Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to revise the acquisition approach.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.

<DESC>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />Department of Education - Federal Student Aid<br />Titanium and Pervasive Software Maintenance &amp; Support
<p>This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR subpart 13, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.</p>
<p>1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.</p>
<p>United States Department of Education, Federal Student Aid (FSA)</p>
<p>2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to renew FSA's software maintenance and support of the Debt Manager Software.  The Debt Manager (DM) software is a suite of COTS products that serves as the foundation of FSA's Debt Management and Collection System (DMCS).  This software has been customized to support the management of FSA's debt collection portfolio and corresponding work flows.  <br /> <br />3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).<br /> <br />FSA is renewing the software maintenance and support for the following Titanium software products:</p>
<p>&bull;	Debt Manager (Titanium) - Maintenance - Standard Support -OMA - Version 9.7</p>
<p>&bull;	Debt Manager (Titanium) - Third Party Maintenance - Pervasive Data - Integrator Engine - OMA - Version 11</p>
<p>&bull;	Debt Manager (Titanium) - Third Party Maintenance - Pervasive Data Integrator Engine - OMA - Version 11<br /> <br />The estimated cost is $557,905.96</p>
<p>4.	An Identification of the statutory authority and support rationale.</p>
<p>This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR 13.5 (Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.</p>
<p>5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>FSA has been using Debt Manager since 2014.  The Debt Manager software serves as the foundation of the Debt Management and Collection System (DMCS). It has been customized in order that FSA can effectively manage FSA's debt collection portfolio and corresponding work flows.  The software is the user interface for the FSA, various Customer Service Agents (CSRs), and Private Collection Agencies (PCA). The software is used to validate and/or change information, payment plans, and provides other features when interacting with the various borrowers.  The software is also used as an extract, transform, load (ETL) tool which is used for the transformation and load of the various flat files received by DMCS so they can be loaded into the DMCS database.</p>
<p>There are products that provide similar functionality that Titanium's software provides.  However, moving to a new software product that performs the same functionality would require FSA to acquire new license(s); configure business applications; retrain the staff in the operations of the new software; and software maintenance.  Any cost savings achieved in conducting a competition would be offset by these expenses.   Therefore, it is more cost effective for FSA to renew the Titanium software suite maintenance.</p>
<p>6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.</p>
<p>FSA has had Titanium software since 2014 and it continues to meet FSA's business and operational requirements.  Therefore, no other potential sources were solicited.</p>
<p>7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Price reasonableness will be determined by using historical pricing that FSA has paid in the past.</p>
<p>8.	A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted, but it was determined that it was not in FSA's interest to move to a new software suite that provides the same functionality as Titanium Debt Management Software.</p>
<p>9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>There are no additional facts needed to support this Brand Name Justification.</p>
<p>10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>No other sources have expressed interest as of the date of this justification.</p>
<p>11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>
<p>In the near term it is the intention of FSA to continue to use the Titanium Debt Management Software Suite outlined in Section 3 of this Brand Name Justification. The financial savings in moving to a different software suite that provides the functionality of Titanium Database Software is minimal taking into consideration of expenses required to deploy a new software platform.  If FSA business requirements change in the future, FSA will conduct new market research to determine if there are potential vendors that could support FSA's new business requirements.</p>
<p><br />12.	Technical Requirements Personnel Certification</p>
<p>I certify this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the support data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate. The requiring FSA program office has provided written supporting data, which is contained in the contract file, that verifies the technical requirements and support the government ongoing need to use the aforementioned brand name commercial items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Anthony Booker<br />Contracting Officer's Representative FSA Technology Office</p>
<p>13.	Certification</p>
<p>I certify that the data supporting this Brand Name Justification is accurate and complete. Therefore, the Contracting Officer hereby determines that it is in the best interest of Federal Student Aid to move forward with this Brand Name acquisition.</p>

<SUBJECT>Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Opportunity for Developing Protein Nanoparticles for the Display of Viral Epitopes for Vaccine Use
<SOLNBR>NIAID-TTIPO-2016-032
<RESPDATE>040919
<CONTACT>Jenish R. Patel, Ph.D., Senior Technology Transfer and Patent Specialist, Phone 2406692894, Email jenish.patel@nih.gov
<DESC>SUMMARY: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health is announcing an opportunity for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for developing protein nanoparticles for the display of viral epitopes for vaccine use. The NIAID seeks to enter into a CRADA with one or more biotechnology or biomedical companies to use protein nanoparticles developed by NIAID for the purpose of vaccine use with one of more of the following capabilities: (i) produce scaled- up purified recombinant protein nanoparticles; (ii) carry out immunogenicity studies in animal models to (a) measure antibody levels/titers elicited by nanoparticles, (b) measure neutralization capacity of antibodies to a panel of influenza viruses, and (c) measure hemagglutination inhibition by antibodies; (iii) produce hydridomas and/or cDNA clones of neutralizing antibody genes elicited by protein nanoparticles; (iv) produce quantities of antibodies sufficient for challenge and protection studies in animal models; (v) carry-out animal challenge and protection studies with influenza viruses and nanoparticles and generate immunological data such as antibody titers, survival curves, and HAI titers; (vi) if the animal data are promising, generate clinical grade materials; and (vii) support clinical studies.
<div><br />SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Influenza virus infects millions of people worldwide on an annual basis. Although drugs are available the virus continues to be a major health treat to its ability to produce drug-resistance strains and its antigenic variation resulting in the need for yearly vaccination. Thus, influenza is an important target for the development of more efficacious vaccines.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The current state of the art in influenza vaccines is dominated by the use of live-attenuated viruses and inactivated viruses. Thus, there is the need to grow and produce influenza viruses every influenza vaccine season. The majority of influenza vaccines on the market rely on egg-adapted influenza viruses as sources for vaccine immunogens. However, during the egg- adaption of influenza virus epitopes in immunogens can mutate and may not antigenically match circulating or future influenza strains leading to antigenic mismatch and lowered vaccine efficacy.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>NIAID has established expression and purification workflows for several promising nanoparticles. NIAID has characterized the interaction of nanoparticles displayed with influenza epitopes with neutralizing antibodies. NIAID has developed novel protein nanoparticles that display influenza epitopes and in vitro testing indicated that nanoparticles interact with influenza antibodies. Initial immunogenicity and protection studies in a small animal mouse model indicated vaccine proof-of-concept in that antibodies were elicited and animals were protected from lethal challenge with influenza virus.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A CRADA is the anticipated collaborative agreement to be entered into with NIAID pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, codified as 15 U.S.C. 3710a, and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended. A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government entities. A CRADA is not a grant, and it is not a contract for the procurement of goods and services. The NIAID is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIAID can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise. The CRADA collaborator can contribute facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funds. The CRADA collaborator will also have an option to negotiate the terms of an exclusive or non- exclusive commercialization license to subject inventions arising under the CRADA. The goals of the CRADA include the rapid publication of research results and timely commercialization of products, diagnostics, and treatments that result from the research.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>EVALUATION CRITERIA: CRADA partners will be expected to carry out additional immunogenicity studies in small animal mouse models with NIAID's protein nanoparticles and if the data are promising, clinical studies may be discussed. It is especially desired that a prospective CRADA partner has expertise in performing and analyzing vaccination of animals with influenza immunogens/viruses and has the ability to perform challenge and protection studies in animals with a candidate influenza vaccine to expand on the initial studies performed by NIAID. Regarding clinical studies, if appropriate, CRADA partners should be able to do one or more of the following: 1) have the capacity to recruit volunteers; 2) to provide clinical facilities; and 3) to provide the personnel required to conduct the research, all in coordination  with the NIAID principal investigator. Collaborator will be expected to provide funding to supplement the NIAID principal investigator's laboratory budget to support this project.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Prospective CRADA partners are expected to provide a written Capability Statement to the contact person indicated in this announcement prior to consideration by NIAID. The Capability Statement must address, with specificity, in addition to each of the above listed capabilities: (1) the technical expertise of the partner's principal investigator and laboratory group; (2) the availability and location of manufacturing and testing facilities to carry out the studies; and (3) the ability to provide adequate funding to support performance of the research plan throughout the life of a CRADA. NIAID will consider executing a Confidentiality Agreement with a prospective CRADA partner to facilitate receipt of the Capability Statement if requested by a prospective CRADA partner.</div>

<p>Issue Date:  09 JANUARY 2019 - Closing Date: 31 JANUARY 2019 - 2:00 PM EDT</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - The Government is issuing this RFI/sources sought announcement as part of market research for Teradyne procurement and sustainment of Teradyne Spectrum 9100 test stations. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to extend the current 5-year commercial service and support contract for another 5 years to a sole source contractor, Teradyne Inc., 700 Riverpark Drive, North Reading, MA 01864-2634, (CAGE 23350). This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Procurement of a system, which is not form, fit and functionally interchangeable, would result in not only development costs but more significantly, sustainment costs.  Duplication of cost estimates were developed by the NSWC Crane Platform and Launch Systems Division.  If the Government was to reverse engineer, it is estimated to take approximately 10 years and $35.6 million to develop a level III technical data package, conduct a competitive procurement, produce prototypes, conduct first article testing (including bench testing and operational testing), produce and deliver end items, and develop Test Program Sets (TPS).  Funds for this amount are not available and could not be recouped if there were a competitive effort.</p>
<p>In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above.  Companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide services and support for the Spectrum 9100 may respond.  Responses shall address how the Government can offset the estimated $35.6 million dollars in cost duplication and the schedule delay that are anticipated to result if a new source is utilized.</p>
<p>Responses shall include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution.</p>
<p>All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, production units, production quantity breaks, an explanation as to why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above given the significant Government investment in the existing services and support for the Spectrum 9100 test stations.</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number:  N00164-19-S-NB37</p>
<p>Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable source for future requirements; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Government requirements and can successfully offset the projected cost duplication and schedule delays. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM).  Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>

<p>AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM (AUG 2012) ACC-APG 5152.233-4900</p>
<p>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible Contracting Officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. Send protests (other than protests to the Contracting Officer) to:</p>
<p>Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command<br />Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road<br />Rm: A6SE040.001<br />Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000<br />Phone: (256) 450-8165<br />Fax: (256) 450-8840<br />E-mail: amcprotests@conus.army.mil</p>
<p>The AMC-Level Protest Procedures are accessible via the Internet at: www.amc.army.mil/amc/commandcounsel.html. If Internet access is not available, contact the Contracting Officer or HQ, AMC, to obtain the AMC Level Protest Procedures.<br />The AMC-Level Protest Procedures are accessible via the Internet at:<br />www.amc.army.mil/amc/commandcounsel.html.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Chest Seals. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Chest Seals products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Chest Seals in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Chest Seals will be established approximately April&nbsp;2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately May 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Chest Seals. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Chest Seals.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Chest Seals. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $3,816,822. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Two items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100 % of the total volume in sales ($3,816,822). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p><strong>1.0 BACKGROUND<br /></strong>The mission of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is to protect the safety and health of the nation's miners. The National Mine Health and Safety Academy was constructed on 76 acres in the early 1970s with the intent to provide a self-contained training facility for the Agency and the mining industry. Mining professionals from across the United States and many foreign countries come to the Academy for health and safety training. The Academy complex, which opened in 1976, consists of 9 buildings, seven of which are inter-connected, making up 347,410 square feet and includes classrooms and laboratories accommodating 600 students, a residence hall of 174 lodging rooms, a cafeteria, a library, auditorium, and wellness facilities.

Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable.

____________________________________________________________________________________
Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors, applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which
the contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1,
2017.  If this contract is covered by the EO, the contractor must provide employees
with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work, up to 56 hours of paid
sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their
own illness, injury or other health-related needs, including preventive care; to
assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill,
injured, or has other health-related needs, including preventive care; or for
reasons resulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is like family
to the employee) who is the victim of, domestic violence, sexual assault, or
stalking.  Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections
under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.48 per hour or $179.20 per week or $776.53 per month

HEALTH & WELFARE EO 13706: $4.18 per hour, or $167.20 per week, or $724.53 per
month*

*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCA-
covered contract also covered by EO 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal
Contractors.  A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any
paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor, 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (See 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day, Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,
Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4.174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **

An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as
screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,
and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.
 All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization,
modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive
ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving re-grading
and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;
minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.  All
operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),
dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.

** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard
Form 1444 (SF-1444) **

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR
4.6(b)(2)(i)).  Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor
prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees
(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).  The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final
determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which
shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day
of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification.  Failure
to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested
parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the
date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act
and this contract.  (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are
included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage
determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S.
Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the
contractor.

6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy
of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See
29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties
requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage
determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).

<p>Note: Page numbers in this document may not be accurate.</p>
<p>All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.SAM.gov) prior to award of a contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management, which indicates "All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT)." Those not currently registered can obtain registration by going to the website http://www.SAM.gov. The process can usually be completed from 24 to 48 hours after submission. Contractors will need to obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (formerly DUNS number) for processing their registration. If you do not already have a Unique Entity Identifier, one can be obtained from http://www.SAM.gov. Refer to www.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg.</p>
<p>Please begin the registration process immediately in order to avoid delay of the contract award should your firm be selected.ALERT: You must submit a notarized letter appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated. This requirement now applies to both new and existing entities. Effective 29 April 2018, the notarized letter process is now mandatory on all CURRENT registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update data on their SAM record. The notarized letter is mandatory and is required before the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) will activate the entity's registration.<br />Effective 29 June 2018, vendors creating or updating their registration can have their registration activated prior to the approval of the required notarized letter. However, the signed copy of the notarized letter must be sent to the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) within 30 days of activation or the vendor risks no longer being active in SAM.</p>
<p>Vendors can check whether an account is active by performing a query by their CAGE or Unique Entity Identifier (known as DUNS). The new registration process may now take several weeks, so vendors are highly encouraged to begin registering as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays in future contract awards. Remember, there is no cost to use SAM.</p>
<p>To find out additional information about the changes of the SAM registration process, contractors should visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) link located at the top of the SAM homepage (www.sam.gov).<br />PLEASE NOTE: SAM is completely free of charge for both registrants and users.</p>

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed End Product Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin: (2) Certification.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies&mdash; (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

<p>i. Subfactor 1: Permits/Certifications/Registrations: The Vendor will be evaluated to ensure that it presented its proof of its factory authorization with Bauer Compressor, Incorporation to be an authorized Bauer Compressor, Inc. sales and service distributor. Failure to meet this subfactor will preclude any further evaluation.</p>
<p>ii. Subfactor 2: Technical Understanding. The Vendor's Technical Understanding must <br />demonstrate a thorough understanding of all the requirements in the PWS. The Vendor will be evaluated as follows:<br />a. The Government will evaluate the Vendor's approach to determine whether they demonstrated an acceptable approach to meet the Government's need in maintenance and repair of the Air Compressor and Seccant Filtration systems accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS). <br />b.

Proposed price will be evaluated for reasonableness using the price analysis techniques provided under FAR Part 13.106-3. Price shall be quoted in accordance with the CLIN(s) structure (0001-4002) provided, in the event an award is made. Price quote evaluations will consider the entire period of performance (including FAR 52.217-8 for the maximum potential extension period of 6 months) for a total overall evaluated Price. The Government will roll-up CLIN prices into an overall total price for the overall evaluated price. The unit price shall include a firm fixed price for each priced CLIN. Quotes shall remain valid for a minimum of 90 days. The Government intends to award a contract based on contractor's responsibility and determination of a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) Extension. As part of the price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding six months of the offeror's final option period price to the offeror's total price. Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential six month extension of services period. The Government may choose to exercise the Option to Extend the Term of the Contract at the end of any performance period (base or option periods), utilizing the rates of that performance period. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s)</p>
<p>(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Vendor within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

*This schedule is only a guideline; maintenance shall be performed quarterly as necessary and as directed by the vernal pool restoration specialist.  Year  refers to Calendar Year.


QUALIFICATIONS:

The Contractor shall have on their staff a USFWS-approved vernal pool restoration specialist. The Contractor s maintenance personnel shall have vernal pool maintenance experience, and perform maintenance work within the vernal pool complexes under direction of the vernal pool restoration specialist.  The vernal pool specialist must have (1) a bachelor's degree with an emphasis in ecology, natural resource management, or related science; (2) minimum of five years of demonstrated local experience with and understanding of the ecology of vernal pools; and (3) previous experience with applying the terms and conditions described in a USFWS Biological Opinion.

Note:  Natural Resource Management monitoring and reporting will be carried out under separate contract by a qualified Natural Resource Manager.  The Natural Resource Manager will coordinate with the Cemetery to ensure habitat management/maintenance goals in the Natural Resource Management Plan are being met.  Any maintenance issues observed during the Natural Resource Manager s quarterly visits will be reported in writing to the Cemetery.  The COR will coordinate with the Contractor to ensure that any maintenance issues reported are addressed in a timely manner.

VERNAL POOL MAINTENANCE DESCRIPTION:

Provide habitat management/maintenance tasks for vernal pools including: natural vernal pools, the restored/enhanced vernal pools, and upland habitat adjacent to these pools. 

Management elements/tasks include:
Weed control;
Trash removal; and
Fence maintenance and repair.

WEED CONTROL: (To be performed Quarterly in accordance with the Natural Resource Management Plan.) Maintenance efforts will be more intensive in the wet months and less intensive in the dry months.

Maintenance emphasis shall be placed on pro-active weed control. Remove all weed species within the restored/enhanced vernal pools and watershed restoration areas.  The area of weed control within these areas encompasses approximately 5 Acres.  (See Natural Resource Management Plan for location of these areas.)

Also remove all weed species within the approximate 50-feet buffer between the limit of cemetery development/operations and the adjacent natural areas/biological resources.  The focus shall be placed on vernal pool islands within 50-feet of the cemetery footprint.  This area encompassed approximately 10.5 Acres.  The purpose is to ensure that cemetery development and operations do not result in the spread of invasive plant species into areas protected from cemetery development. 

NOTE:  Weed control for the natural areas within the approved development cemetery footprint is not to be included in this work.

Weeds within the existing vernal pool complexes and vernal pool islands shall be closely monitored, and removed to protect these sensitive areas from weed invasions.

Weed species of major maintenance concern include, but are not limited to: bent grass (Agrostis avenacea); grass poly (Lythrum hyssopifolium); curly dock (Rumex crispus); rabbits foot grass (Polypogon monspeliensis); filaree (Erodium spp.); Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum); tocalote (Centaurea melitensis); and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare).

Remove all perennial weed species listed on Lists A & B of the California Invasive Plant Council's (Cal-IPC) "California Invasive Plant Inventory" (March 2006 plus updates) from vernal pool complexes enclosed by the 3-wire fence.  (A copy of the complete list can be obtained from Cal-IPC's web site at http://www.cal-ipc.org.)  Of particular concern are pampasgrass (Cortaderia selloana), iceplant (Carpobrotus spp.)/ (Mesembryanthemum spp.), and tamarisk (Tamarix spp.).  

All workers conducting weed removal activities shall be proficient at distinguishing between native and non-native species, with special attention paid to rare and endangered plant species.   

Perform weeding within and immediately adjacent to the restored and existing pools by hand and with hand tools. Take care when working within pools to avoid removing vernal pool plant species and to reduce soil disturbance. 

Dispose of weeds offsite in a legal manner at the Contractor s expense.  Transport weeds in transparent plastic bags to avoid spreading seeds.  Contractor may store commercial trash dumpster(s) in the contractor maintenance yard for the purpose of weed dispos ose of weed, trash and debris remoavl n the Contractor maintenance yard as directed by the COR.mely manner.will 999999999999al as directed by the COR.

Remove weeds in the upland watershed areas by hand tools whenever possible.  However, focused herbicide application may be used if needed by requesting and coordinating their use with the Natural Resource Manager.

Any herbicide treatments shall be pre-approved by the Pacific District Agronomist and comply with MCAS Miramar's Pest Management Plan, shall have chemicals approved by the Navy's regional pesticide approval process, and the usage shall be reported through MCAS Miramar's Pest Management Record System, and the COR for recording in the Miramar National Cemetery Environmental Management System (EMS).

Contractor shall contact MCAS Miramar's Pest Management Coordinator, for current information if herbicide usage was determined to be necessary.  The coordinator s contact information is will be made available at contract award from the cemetery director.

Additionally, no herbicide shall be used within 5 feet of any vernal pools. Herbicides shall not be used during wet or windy conditions.

Do not to saturate the soils with herbicide, nor allow any herbicide to be blown into pools. 

Mechanical removal of weed species with a string trimmer or other such device in the upland areas may be necessary. However, no mechanical weed removal devices shall be used in any pool.  

Do not remove weeds in the pools while the pools are wet, or within the remainder of the vernal pool restoration area. 

Hydrologic conditions shall be modified if necessary to assure prolonged periods of inundation to help control weeds, since pools that hold water longer generally have fewer invasive species. 

SDS (Safety Data Sheets) are required for all chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, etc.  A master file of SDS sheets shall be provided to the COR.  The Contractor shall also maintain a file of all SDS sheets wherever these materials are stored.   

 
TRASH REMOVAL: (To be performed Quarterly in accordance with the Natural Resource Management Plan.)
The Contractor shall remove any trash and debris encountered within the six (6) separately fenced areas enclosing the vernal pool complexes, restoration/enhancement pools, upland pool buffer watersheds, and vernal pool islands representing approximately 65 Acres. The vernal pool complexes and vernal pool islands which share edges with Miramar Rd. and Nobel Dr. will require additional attention since these areas are the most likely recipients of windborne trash and littering from off-site.  It is extremely important to remove any metal debris since it has the ability to alter vernal pool chemistry.  (See Natural Resource Management Plan for location of the fenced areas.)

Trash removal also includes an additional area 50-feet beyond the limit of cemetery development/operations representing approximately 10.5 Acres.  The focus of trash removal shall be in this interface between the edge the cemetery development footprint and areas protected from cemetery development, since these areas are the most likely locations where trash, construction materials, vegetation debris, etc. from cemetery construction and operations would be most likely to occur.

Dispose of trash and debris offsite in a legal manner at the Contractor s expense.  The Cemetery will not provide refuse containers for the execution of this contract.  The Contractor must pay for and arrange for collection and removal of waste generated by the execution of this contract from the cemetery. The Contractor may store commercial trash dumpster(s) in the contractor maintenance yard for trash and debris removal as directed by the COR.


FENCE MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR: (To be performed Quarterly in accordance with the Natural Resource Management Plan.) 

Vernal pool complexes are enclosed by a 3-wire fence located around the perimeter of the protected areas.  There is approximately 14,000 lineal feet of fence and gates to be maintained.  

Fences and gates are subject to vandalism, and to animal damage. (See Natural Resource Management Plan for location of fenced areas.)

Permanent fencing shall be maintained in place around those vernal pools to be protected on site to restrict human access. The fencing will be maintained such that it does not alter the natural hydrological regimes of the area.

Fencing shall be maintained by reinstalling or replacing steel  T-stake  posts and smooth wire to match existing.  In locations were fencing has been cut by trespassers, smooth wire has been replaced with barbed wire to deter further vandalism.  Repair or replace barbed wire to match existing.

Gates will be maintained and repaired by replacing/reinstalling matching hardware and fence materials.

Re-secure signs to fences.  Replace damaged or illegible signs to warn trespassers of  Restricted Area   Keep Out   Authorized Personnel Only  in both English and Spanish.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION MEETING
As will be discussed during the Post Award Orientation meeting, the issuance of a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR) may be cause for the scheduling of a meeting among the Contractor, Contracting Officer, and the Contracting Officer Representative.  A mutual effort will be made to resolve all problems identified.  The Government will prepare written minutes of the meeting.  Minutes of the meeting (s) will be signed by the Contractor, Contracting Officer, and the Contracting Officer Representative.

Should the Contractor not concur with the minutes, he/she shall state in writing to the Contracting Officer within ten calendar days any areas he does not concur and explain the reasons for non-concurrence.  The Contracting Officer will review and consider the reasons submitted for the Contractor's non-concurrence and make a decision.  The Contractor shall be notified of the decision in writing within ten calendar days by the Contracting Officer.

Normally, the COR will verbally advise or give a written inspection report to the Contractor of discrepancies the first time they occur and ask the Contractor to correct the problem.  A notation will be made on the COR checklist of the date and the time the deficiency was discovered and the date and time the Contractor was notified.

If the Government created any of the discrepancies, these will not be counted against the Contractor's performance.  When the Government has caused the Contractor to perform in an unsatisfactory manner, a letter must be written to the responsible organizational element requesting corrective action is taken. 

When the Contractor is not meeting the limits of satisfactory performance, a CDR will be issued to the Contractor.  The seriousness of the failures should govern whether to issue CDR at the end of the period, or as soon as the limits of satisfactory performance are exceeded. 

When a CDR is issued for a service, the Contracting Officer must deduct from the periodic payment, a percentage of that payment as indicated in the Performance of Work Requirements Summary as attached hereto. 

If the Contractor does not achieve satisfactory performance by the end of the next period or agreed suspense date, another CDR will be issued and the appropriate amount deducted from the periodic payment. 

A third CDR will be the cause for a Cure Notice.  However, the Contracting Officer may issue a Cure Notice at any time he/she deems appropriate.

Depending on the overall performance of the Contractor, an unsatisfactory reply to the Cure Notice should require a Show Cause letter to be issued, followed by consideration of termination of the contract.

SURVEILLANCE OF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE
As will be discussed during the Post Award Orientation meeting, the Contracting Officer will periodically check the Contracting Officer s Representative's records and/or accompany the Contracting Officer s Representative during scheduled surveillance to ascertain that the Contracting Officer's surveillance plan is properly executed.

The Contracting Officer will verify that the Contracting Officer Representative is accomplishing the inspection in accordance with the surveillance plan.  Observation of one or two checks will be sufficient to verify the Contracting Officer Representative's procedures.

 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION MEETING:
As will be discussed during the Post Award Orientation meeting, the issuance of a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR) may be cause for the scheduling of a meeting among the Contractor, Contracting Officer, and the Contracting Officer Representative.

Minutes of the meeting(s) will be signed by the Contractor, Contracting Officer, and the Contracting Officer Representative.

Should the Contractor not concur with the minutes, he/she shall state in writing to the Contracting Officer within ten calendar days any areas he does not concur and explain the reasons for non-concurrence.  The Contracting Officer will review and consider the reasons submitted for the Contractor's non-concurrence and make a decision.  The Contractor shall be notified of the decision in writing within ten calendar days by the Contracting Officer.

Normally, the COR will verbally advise or give a written inspection report to the Contractor of discrepancies the first time they occur and ask the Contractor to correct the problem.  A notation will be made on the COR checklist of the date and the time the deficiency was discovered and the date and time the Contractor was notified.

If the Government created any of the discrepancies, these will not be counted against the Contractor's performance.  When the Government has caused the Contractor to perform in an unsatisfactory manner, a letter must be written to the responsible organizational element requesting corrective action is taken. 

When the Contractor is not meeting the limits of satisfactory performance, a CDR will be issued to the Contractor.  The seriousness of the failures should govern whether to issue CDR at the end of the period, or as soon as the limits of satisfactory performance are exceeded. 

When a CDR is issued for a service, the Contracting Officer must deduct from the periodic payment, a percentage of that payment as indicated in the Performance of Work Requirements Summary as attached hereto. 

If the Contractor does not achieve satisfactory performance by the end of the next period or agreed suspense date, another CDR will be issued and the appropriate amount deducted from the periodic payment. 

A third CDR will be the cause for a Cure Notice.  However, the Contracting Officer may issue a Cure Notice at any time he/she deems appropriate.

Depending on the overall performance of the Contractor, an unsatisfactory reply to the Cure Notice should require a Show Cause letter to be issued, followed by consideration of termination of the contract.

52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items 
ADDENDUM to FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS:


This is FAR Part 13 acquisition utilizing Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government considering price and other factors. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Technical Capability   The Government will evaluate quotes on the basis of whether or not the offeror provided a signed statement certifying that the quote submitted meets the technical capability specified in the Statement of Work.  Technical Capability shall consist of meeting the technical requirements of the Statement of Work.

Price   The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to make a price reasonableness determination. Offers that do not meet the technical capability requirements of the Statement of Work shall not be selected regardless of price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(d)  All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the review in the most effective manner.  Specifically, the Government may first sort the quotes of all Offerors by price from lowest price to the highest.  Thereafter, the Government will review the Technical Capability of the lowest priced quote only.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to be acceptable and meets the requirements, the Government may make award to that Offeror without further reviews of the remaining Offerors  Technical Capability.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to not meet the requirement, then the Government may review the Technical Capability next lowest priced quote, and so on, until the Government reaches a quote that is determined to meet the Technical Capability requirements.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Disinfecting Surface Wipes with Hydrogen Peroxide. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MN-1807-72_Disinfecting_Surface_Wipes_with_Hydrogen_Peroxide are eligible for participation. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Disinfecting Surface Wipes with Hydrogen Peroxide products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MN-1807-72_Disinfecting_Surface_Wipes_with_Hydrogen_Peroxide. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 24 Feb 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MN-1807-72_Disinfecting_Surface_Wipes_with_Hydrogen_Peroxide, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Disinfecting Surface Wipes with Hydrogen Peroxide.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Disinfecting Surface Wipes with Hydrogen Peroxide. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $202,101 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MN-1807-72_Disinfecting_Surface_Wipes_with_Hydrogen_Peroxide who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO North via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />1. DISINFECTING SURFACE WIPES WITH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, 90 - 190 WIPES PER CANISTER / 2,466,380<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor instructions for Submission of DAPA Log and Commercial Pricing information</span><br />3. Vendor must submit a DAPA Log via the DAPA Management System (DMS) Manufacturer's Application including all offered items and relevant base uncommitted pricing for each. Submitted log base uncommitted pricing must correlate directly to that on the IA FBO Package Worksheet for all offered items. Vendors must send a screenshot of their submitted DAPA Log or of the required items already on their existing DAPA. Screenshots must be received by the MMESO POC's by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /><br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Commercial pricing will help DAPA administrators make a fair and reasonable determination. To assist DAPA administrators in identifying Standardization submissions via e-mail, vendors should cite the product line name and IA number as shown in this IA FBO announcement.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price evaluation is based on the sum of each required item's offered IA unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. If all other requirements have been met, the lowest overall price will be selected for the IA for Standardization. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes, but reserves the right to seek further discounts or request revised quotes if determined necessary. <br /><strong>&bull; In order to be eligible for selection, vendors are required to have established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line by time of selection.<br />&bull; Failure to establish a DAPA with approved base uncommitted pricing will preclude a vendor from being selected to establish an IA with the government.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />MMESO North Data Analyst, Juan Gonzales, 571-231-5511, <a href="mailto:juan.a.gonzales8.ctr@mail.mil">juan.a.gonzales8.ctr@mail.mil</a>, and MMESO North Team Leader, Ms. Vivian Alexander, 571-231-5451, vivian.r.alexander.ctr@mail.mil.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>QUESTION AND ANSWER FROM 36C24519Q0088 
SOLICITATION FOR WATER FILTER FOR SPS 20 MICRON 
ORIGINAL SOLICITATION ATTACHED FOR REFERENCE. 
PLEASE SEE THE BELOW Q&A AND RESPOND WITH UPDATED/REVISED QUOTE NO LATER THAN JANUARY 10 AT 3:00 PM.

The description of the water filter uses the term  duplex filter assembly  with each assembly consisting of two filter housings, 4 pressure gauges, 4 butterfly values, connecting piping fasteners and miscellaneous material. Is it correct to assume that duplexing means to connect the filter housings in parallel? With one pair of housings for the hot water line and the other pair of housing for the cold water. We have attached a sketch depicting our understanding of your requirements. One filter assembly consists of two filters with necessary pipes valves, fittings and gauges. The filters will be in a parallel configuration. One of the filters of the assembly would be in service at any given time. The other filter of the assembly would be either being serviced or ready to be placed in service. 

Assuming our sketch is accurate, are there any isolation valves required? Or will the butterfly valves be used for flow control and isolation? The sketch is correct with the disclaimer that it is representative sketch and not the actual piping configuration. There are other valves that will be used for isolation of the filter assembly as well as the various devices downstream of the filters. 

The filter housings are required to be 304L stainless steel. Are the butterfly valves, pressure gauges and other components required to be 304L stainless also? The drawing, 7F023-2F-GPA-V-DPX indicates the butterfly valves   wetted bodies parts are 316L stainless steel   cast steel valve seat. the pressure gauges and other components should be of an appropriate material. 

Lastly, the Shelco part number 7FOS3-GPA-V-DPX provides for standard mounting legs. Can you confirm the standard mounting legs, as opposed to the heavy duty legs, are acceptable? Standard legs are acceptable.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a member of the OTI Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) Team, the Learning. Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition, stabilization, and conflict mitigation programs, to provide support and guidance for country program staff to help ensure the successful implementation of OTI program activities in the field. <br /> <br />OTI's success now and in the future depends in large part on its ability to achieve an overarching organizational goal: the effective transfer and ongoing analysis of knowledge and experience - comprised of values, management processes, lessons learned, best practices, standards, and innovations - in real time, with a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders include: OTI staff in the field and headquarters; OTI's implementing partners around the world; USAID Missions overseas; other USAID offices and bureaus in Washington; other U.S. Government agencies and branches; other donors; other transition, stabilization and reconstruction practitioners; host government and/or other local counterparts; and the U.S. public. All of the above increases OTI's level of transparency and accountability.<br /> <br />To this end, the OTI ABC Team supports a model of organizational learning across the office that ensures:</p>
<p>1.	Increased communication and exchange of ideas between headquarters and field teams;<br />2.	Increased opportunities for peer-to-peer dialogue;<br />3.	Easier access to content and learning resources for a variety of stakeholders;<br />4.	More guidance available in online format;<br />5.	Provision of tools to surface and apply OTI's programming lessons to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of OTI programs.</p>
<p>The Learning Specialist supports OTI's mission to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political transition and stabilization needs by building the knowledge, skills and abilities of OTI staff to continually improve country program performance. The Learning Specialist does this by: supporting the design and coordination of innovative solutions that are adapted to OTI's fast-paced global needs; supporting and facilitating learning and training events; and providing support services ranging from procurement to linkages with private sector partners. ABC supports learning and innovation through the application of technology - including OTI's knowledge management platform, mapping, data visualization, and other analytic tools - to continually improve OTI country program analysis, management and performance. ABC will ensure the effective integration of lessons and knowledge into OTI's learning and training resources. ABC coordinates closely with other units, teams, and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>OTI's Learning Specialist position provides support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of lessons learned.  The Learning Specialist will be supervised by the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) Team Leader of the ABC Team, or his/her designee.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Learning Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the position requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change, while maintaining professional and constructive relations with colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he builds and maintains relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on his/her own actions without prompting, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The incumbent is service-oriented, highly organized and pays close attention to detail. S/he is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The incumbent serves as OTI's principal strategist and facilitator of program learning and staff training. The Learning Specialist assists OTI partners and staff - principally those working for the Program Learning and Innovation (PLI) and Field Programs Divisions (FPD) - to gain the knowledge, skills, and abilities to maximize country program performance and individual professional performance. This includes the conceptualization and oversight of knowledge management strategies, program performance management processes, and activities in support of learning and training.

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>
<p>Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 7. <br />USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR)</p>
<p>APPENDIX D - DIRECT USAID CONTRACTS WITH A U.S. CITIZEN OR A U.S. RESIDENT ALIEN FOR PERSONAL SERVICES ABROAD</p>
<p>GP 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES (MAY 2018) (Pursuant to class deviation #M/OAA-DEV-AIDAR-18-3c)</p>
<p>USAID will provide Medevac services to the contractor and authorized dependents, through the Department of State's Bureau for Medical Services (MED), similar to those provided to U.S. Government employees in accordance with 16 FAM 300 Medical Travel. Medevac costs include travel and per diem, but do not include medical care costs. To be covered by the Medevac program, the contractor and authorized dependents must obtain and maintain international health insurance coverage that includes overseas hospitalization, and must provide proof of such insurance to the contracting officer prior to relocation abroad.</p>

<p><strong>This is a Request for Information (RFI)<br /><br />OVERVIEW:</strong> The Air Force Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA) 338th Specialized Contracting Squadron (SCONS) is seeking information from industry service providers capable of providing Aircraft Maintenance and Support Services as a prime contractor for an enterprise-wide Air Force (AF) aircraft maintenance services contract. Current customers include, but are not limited to the following: Air Education and Training Command (AETC) at Columbus Air Force Base (AFB) in Columbus, Mississippi; Vance AFB in Enid, OK; Sheppard AFB in Wichita Falls, TX; and the Air Mobility Command (AMC) Executive Airlift Mission at Joint Base Andrews, in Prince George's County, MD. This Enterprise contract will accept additional aircraft maintenance customers from any Major Command (MAJCOM) at any AF location within the Contiguous United States (CONUS), Alaska, and Hawaii throughout the period of performance (PoP); therefore, additional aircraft maintenance scope may be available in the future. This RFI is issued for informational and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>The Government is considering a strategic sourcing/enterprise contract vehicle to support aircraft maintenance and flight line-related services for the AF. Specifically, the Government is pursuing an award of a Multiple Award Contract (MAC) with Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity task orders. The PoP will have a 10 year ordering period and up to an additional 5 years for performance after the last order is placed for a total possible period performance of 15 years. The anticipated periods of performance on individual task orders would range from three to five years, with task order performance occurring at one or more bases/units. The Government currently anticipates that its first task order on the MAC would be issued for performance at Vance AFB. Additional task orders would be placed for other bases/units as required.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is not a Request for Proposal. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result of this RFI. Any information provided by businesses to the Government is strictly voluntary.

<DESC><p align="left"><br /><strong>**********UPDATE*****************************************<br />The purpose of this amendment to respond to&nbsp;industry questions and&nbsp;as a result, update the solicitation, Attachment 2, and Attachment 10. The answers to industry questions are as follows:&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">QUESTION:</span></strong> <strong>There seems to be a mismatch between the Price Model spreadsheet and the CDRL associated with CLIN X004AA (IATP Analysis).&nbsp; In the Price Model spreadsheet,&nbsp;offerors can only enter unit prices for the base year and Option Year 1 for CLIN X004AA, but the final report associated with that CLIN (CDRL A011) is not due until Option Year 5. If the government intends for the IATP Analysis task to be completed after Option Year 1, <br />it would seem that CDRL A011 should be due well before Option Year 5.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANSWER:</span> CDRL A011 delivery requirment has been updated. CLIN's 1009AL and 5009AL are updated to reflect the delivery change.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">QUESTION: </span>In the Scope Reference spreadsheet:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;a)&nbsp; In cell B4, 4.3.5 is listed twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;b) in cell&nbsp; B6, 4.4.5.1 is not in the PWS.<br />&nbsp;c) In cell B9, please clarify whether the government intends&nbsp;4.4.3.2&nbsp;to be&nbsp;listed in this cell.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANSWER</span>: In cell B4, the duplicate PWS reference has been deleted. In cell B6, PWS reference 4.4.5.1 is removed. In cell B9, PWS reference 4.4.3.2 was removed.<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">QUESTION</span>: In the Excel file row 6, there is a reference to "4.4.5.1" for CLIN X005 which does not exist in the PWS. Explicit reference to paragraph 4.3.6.1 does not exist in the table (as does 4.3.6.2), could this be intended for row 6 in lieu of 4.4.5.1?&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANSWER</span>: The PWS reference 4.4.5.1 is hereby removed. PWS reference 4.3.6.1 is hereby added to cell B4 for CLIN X001.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">QUESTION:</span> PWS paragraphs 4.4.3.1, 4.4.3.2 and 4.4.3.3 are all listed against two [or more] CLINs. Please provide guidance on how the associated costs are to be split.&nbsp; 50%/50% in the case of two referenced CLINs and&nbsp; 33%/33%/33% in the case of three referenced CLINs?<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANSWER:</span> Please be advised that PWS reference 4.4.3.2 is hereby removed from cell B9. PWS reference 4.4.3.3 is hereby removed from cell B7. Cost for any case where the same PWS paragraph references two (2) separate CLINS, the offeror should split the pricing 50%/50%.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />**********UPDATE******************************************<br /><br /><br />The Purpose of this Amendment is to update solicitation FA8505-18-R-0004 <br />(formally FA8505-17-R-0015), as well as all supporting attachments. <br /><br />The attached solicitation and attachments are hereby updated, attached, <br />and supercede all other attachments.<br />&nbsp;<br />As a result, the&nbsp;proposal due date is extended to 15 January 2019. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />**********UPDATE******************************************<br /><br />Please excuse the continued delays.

FedBizOps notes 26 July and the Solicitation notes 16 July.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:</span></strong> The proposal due date is 26 July18 at 3:30 pm and all questions regarding the proposal are due 9 July 18 at 11:59 pm. A revised Solicitation including the revised due date for proposals is hereby attached to this amendment. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:</span></strong> Section L - Are additional instructions missing from paragraph "2. Format and Specific Content: The following information shall be provided in the written technical proposal and will be evaluated to assess technical acceptability in accordance with Section M-900, Evaluation Basis for Award. The written technical proposal shall address each of the following sub-factors to describe the offeror's proposed approach to performing the requirements as set forth in the Performance-based Work Statement (PWS)." It seems like there should have been more here.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:</span></strong>&nbsp;Section L, subsection C(2) &nbsp;has been revised as follows:</p>
<p>FROM: 2. Format and Specific Content: The following information shall be provided in the written technical proposal and will be evaluated to assess technical acceptability in accordance with Section M-900, Evaluation Basis for Award. The written technical proposal shall address each of the following sub-factors to describe the offeror's proposed approach to performing the requirements as set forth in the Performance-based Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>TO: 2. Format and Specific Content: Three (3) Subfactors will be evaluated to assess the technical acceptability in accordance with Section M-900, Evaluation Basis for Award. The written technical proposal shall address each of the Sub-factors listed in Section M, sub-section III to describe the offeror's proposed approach to performing the requirements as set forth in the Performance-based Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:</span></strong> Section L - There are no instructions for the cost volume. It would appear logically that they would follow the instructions for Volumes 1 and 2. Are additional instructions missing?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:</span></strong> Please refer to Section L, sub-section II, A(8) where it states that Volume III shall be presented in excel format with the ability to view any formulas or calculations (see Attach_10_Pricing_Spreadsheet and Attach_8_VPP_DART_TCIR_Chart). Volume III, TEP Attachment should not be adjusted, except for adding unit prices. There are no additional instructions for this volume.</p>

<p>NOTICE TYPE:</p>
<p>Sources Sought</p>
<p>TITLE:</p>
<p>Technical Support for Highway Safety</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH:<br />The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting market research to determine if there are interested, capable, and qualified offerors, especially small businesses, in the marketplace with the knowledge, skills, qualifications, and capability to perform the work described below. FHWA is contemplating making multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) awards for program support activities to support the FHWA Office of Safety (HSA) programs. HSA is seeking to identify entities with the breadth and depth of expertise and resources capable of performing in all subject areas of the Statement of Work. <br /><br />PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>One of the key responsibilities of the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Office of Safety (HSA) is to develop and implement highway safety programs. The effective execution of this responsibility requires an integrated program development process which includes, but is not limited to, the following: feasibility studies, focus group meetings, development of technical reports, guidance, standards, and training; development of regulatory requirements; and outreach to industry. Seamless continuity and integration of these efforts is critical to achieve the highest possible reliability and effectiveness.</p>
<p>HSA contains five safety-focused teams related to the following activities: Strategic Integration, Implementation and Evaluation, Safety Design, Safety Operations, and Data and Analysis Tools. This project will support the mission and related activities of HSA, its partners and customers.</p>
<p>The mission of the Office of Safety is to exercise leadership throughout the highway community to make the Nation's roadways safer for all road users: developing, evaluating, and deploying lifesaving countermeasures; advance the use of scientific methods and data-driven decisions; foster a safety culture; and promoting an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to safety. This is accomplished through programs and initiatives of HSA, and/or of its partners, customers, and others (including other FHWA offices and Federal agencies, State and local government agencies, various public and private organizations and industries, the public, and when appropriate, other countries).</p>
<p>The work described within provides a flexible approach that supports HSA and equips it to meet its current and future mission and priorities. This project consists of a continuous contractor-aided program under the overall management of the Government. The contractor will provide services involving engineering, programmatic, outreach, marketing, education, training, and administrative support.</p>
<p>The objectives of road safety involve reducing the number of fatalities and serious injuries by reducing the number of crashes and mitigating the impacts during and/or after the crashes. The Office of Safety focuses on providing leadership, research, development, deployment and coordination for improving safety in the following areas: roadway departures, pedestrian and bicyclist safety, speed management, work zones, highway-rail crossings. The Office of Safety also undertakes initiatives and programs, including those of partners and customers, associated with road, vehicle, and road user improvements. Improving road safety involves the 4 Es (Engineering, Education, Enforcement and Emergency medical service) devices, and systems that can be developed based on data collection, analysis, and evaluations.</p>

<DESC>This Modification No. 02 to the Synopsis dated 06 December 2018 is being issued as follows:

1.	 Criterion 1 - Firms Specialized Experience, is revised to the following: 

Firms recent specialized experience in the design of new base development facility projects, $20 million or more in construction value per project/contract, completed in the past ten (10) years, including execution of all specified design and engineering services; i.e., execution of DD 1391s or similar project programming document, FACD/design charrettes, Design-Build (DB) Request for Proposal (RFP) contract documents, and Design-Bid-Build (DBB) contract documents.  Repair and alteration projects shall not be considered.
 Base development facility projects include, but are not limited to, bachelor enlisted quarters, bachelor officer quarters, headquarters, fire station, police station, dining facility, fitness center, school/training, public works/maintenance shop, military training range, and utilities and supporting infrastructure.  Specified design and engineering services (execution of DD 1391s or similar project programming document, FACD/design charrettes, DB RFP contract documents, and DBB contract documents) for new base development facility projects do not have to from a single project; however, base development facility projects that contain several and more of these services will be given more favorable consideration than projects that contain only one of these services.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:

SF330, Part I, Section F.
 Submit a maximum of seven (7) relevant projects completed in the past ten (10) years from the date of issuance of this Notice, which best describe recent specialized experience in the design of new base development facility projects AND the specified design and engineering services indicated above.  Completed in the past ten (10) years refers to final construction completion.  Relevant projects with final design completion in the past ten (10) years and under construction (construction ongoing; not final construction completion) can be submitted; however, may be considered less favorably.  If more than seven (7) projects are submitted for evaluation, the Government will evaluate the first seven (7) projects and disregard any other project information after the first seven (7) projects.
 Of the maximum of seven (7) projects, at least one (1) each shall be for a utilities and supporting infrastructure project, and at least four (4) each shall be for some of the other types of base development facility projects listed.  Of the maximum of seven (7) projects to be submitted, more variety in the types of base development facility projects indicated above will be given more favorable consideration.  A project with multiple functions shall be considered as one base development facility project based upon its primary function.  For example, a headquarters building, which also includes dining, fitness center, and training areas, shall be identified by its primary function; i.e., headquarters; and shall be considered one project.
 Indicate the primary function (base development facility project type) for each project submitted as part of the project description.  Base development facility projects designed and constructed in severe, tropical environments similar to Guam (subject to high winds and high humidity) will be considered more favorably.
  
All projects provided in the SF330 must be completed by the actual office/branch/regional office/individual team member proposed to manage and perform work under this contract.  Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from consideration in the evaluation.  To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF330 part 1, Section F, Block 25, Firm Name.
 Include a contract number or project identification number in Block 21.  Include an e-mail address and phone number for the point of contact in Block 239c0.  In Block 24, include the project description, the contract period of performance, original construction contract award amount, final construction contract amount, and a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above.

The submission shall include a discussion of who executed the project as pertinent to demonstrating specialized experience.  For projects performed as a subcontractor or a joint venture involving different partners, specifically indicate the value of the work performed as a subcontractor or by those firms proposed for this contract, and identify the specific roles and responsibilities performed as a subcontractor or by those firms on the project rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.
 If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE:  If the firm is a joint venture, projects performed by the joint venture should be submitted; however, if there are no projects performed by the joint venture, projects may be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of seven (7) relevant projects.  Each project shall include project title and location; year completed; project owner; point-of-contact name, e-mail address, and phone number; contract number or project identification number, contract period of performance; construction contract award amount; and description of project and relevance to this synopsis.
 For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  A project is further defined as a design-bid-build project, a complete final design performed under a design contract; or a complete final design performed under a design-build construction contract.  A design-build RFP solicitation document shall not be considered a project qualifying for specialized experience.  Do not submit an IDIQ contract as an example project.  The Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract.  Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.

All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in the SF330, Part I, Section F.
 The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in additional to Part 1, Section F in evaluation of Criterion 1.

If a project was performed by a joint venture, and all joint venture partners are not on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror should specifically address the work performed on the project submitted by the proposed joint venture partner(s).  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the proposed joint venture partner(s), the project will be evaluated less favorably.  Likewise, if the proposed joint venture partner(s) worked as a subcontractor on a project, the offeror should specifically address the work performed by the proposed joint venture partner(s) on the project submitted.
 If a project does not provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers, that project may be evaluated less favorably. Note: If the A-E firm is a joint venture, info should be submitted for projects performed by the joint venture; however, if there are no recent relevant projects performed by the joint venture, submit projects performed by the individual partner entities of the joint venture.  

A subcontractors or sub-consultants specialized experience on a design-bid-build project will not be given the same level of consideration as either the prime contractor or the joint venture partner(s).   Prime contractor-subcontractor/sub-consultant teams/Joint Ventures/LLCs/LTDs with a demonstrated history of working successfully together on prior projects may be considered more favorably than those without such history.

2.	Criterion 2 - Firms Specialized Experience, is revised to the following:

Key Personnels Professional Qualifications, and Specialized Experience and Technical Competence:  

Key personnel will be evaluated on professional qualifications, competence, and experience of the proposed key personnel in providing services to accomplish the tasks required under this contract, including participation in example projects as outlined in the SF330, Part I, Section G.


(a)	Professional Qualifications:

SS330, Part I, Section H.  Identify key personnel of the proposed design team(s) of the A-E firm, including the Principal-in-Charge of the prime A-E firm; the Project Manager, Project Architect, or Project Engineer for the Architectural, Structural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, and Fire Protection design disciplines; and the Cost Estimator.  

SF330, Part I, Section E.  Submit professional qualifications of key personnel shall include active U.S. professional registration or equivalent qualifications (i.e., APEC and other similar professional certifications will be considered in the evaluation).  For Cost Estimator, indicate years of experience; professional registration is not required.
 Limit the submission of key personnel to staff three design teams: maximum of three (3) Principal-in-Charge of the prime A-E firm and maximum of three (3) Project Manager, Project Architect, or Project Engineer for each of the major design disciplines described above (including Cost Estimating).  Submission of professional qualifications of personnel of the design team other than the key personnel is not required, and if submitted, will not be considered in the evaluation.  Note:  During contract execution, U.S. professional registration will be required for all architects and engineers who approve designs in their registered discipline(s).

(b)	Specialized Experience and Technical Competence: 

SF330, Part I, Section E.
 Key personnel specialized experience and technical competence in the design of new base development facility projects, approximately $20 million or more in construction value per project/contract, completed in the past ten (10) years from the date of issuance of this Notice, including all specified design and engineering services; i.e., execution of DD 1391s or similar project programming document, FACD/design charrettes, Design-Build (DB) Request for Proposal (RFP) contract documents, and Design-Bid-Build (DBB) contract documents.  See Selection Criteria 1 for description of new base development facility projects.  Repair and alteration projects shall not be considered.  Completed in the past ten (10) years refers to final construction completion.
 Relevant projects with final design completion in the past ten (10) years and under construction (construction ongoing; not final construction completion) can be submitted; however, may be considered less favorably.  Submission of specialized experience information shall be limited to the key personnel noted as follows.  Specialized experience for other key personnel is not required and if submitted, shall not be evaluated.  Submit a maximum of two (2) utilities and supporting infrastructure projects each for Civil Project Engineer and Electrical Project Engineer, demonstrating experience in the execution of DD 1391s or similar project programming document, and DBB contract document.  Submit a maximum of three (3) projects for some of the other types of base development facility projects listed for each of two (2) Project Architects (maximum total of six (6) projects, demonstrating experience in the specified design and engineering services (execution of DD 1391s or similar project programming document, FACD/design charrettes, DB RFP contract documents, and DBB contract documents).
 More variety in the types of base development facility projects will be more favorably considered.  Base development facility projects designed and constructed in severe, tropical environments similar to Guam (subject to high winds, seismicity, and corrosion) will be considered more favorably.  Specified design and engineering services do not have to be from a single project scope.  A project or contract is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order in an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract having the features described above.  A project is further defined as a design-bid-build project, a complete final design performed under a design contract; or a complete final design performed under a design-build construction contract.
 A design-build RFP solicitation document shall not be considered a project qualifying for key personnel specialized experience.  If more than the maximum number of projects for the key personnel specified is submitted, the Government will not evaluate and disregard this extraneous project information.  Each project shall include:  Project description; point of contact name, e-mail address, and phone number; contract number or project identification number; contract period of performance; construction cost; and the role and experience the individual had in performing the project.  If a project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the individual (including the specialized design and engineering service) or if a project does not provide the requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers, that project will be evaluated less favorably.

<DESC><p>The Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA),&nbsp;as the&nbsp;Contract Review Board (CRB) Chair, gave approval on December 20, 2018 to increase the Kalypso contract (HM0476-16-C-0042) ceiling authority from $136.7M by $149.6M to $286.3M in order to re-baseline the scope for Option Years Three (3), Four (4) and Five (5).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The rationale for this authority is cited under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements without unacceptable delays in fullfilling the agency's requirements.&nbsp; As a explained in the Justification &amp; Approval (J&amp;A), NGA is faced with a tight schedule&nbsp;to integrate new&nbsp;mission capabilities&nbsp;by critical milestone dates.&nbsp; Additionally, the Government believes that shifting to&nbsp;another contractor at this time will result in a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition (see FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii(A)).&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel and as a condition of&nbsp;approving an increase to the Kalypso contract's ceiling authority, the responsible program office must begin pre-acquisition planning now for a future competition with an anticipated timeframe of award anticipated for&nbsp;late fiscal year 2020.&nbsp; Further details&nbsp;about this contract change will be available in the upcoming signed J&amp;A is&nbsp;expected to be posted on the Classified Acquisition Resource Center (IC-ARC).&nbsp; Further,&nbsp;the program office has been directed to look at&nbsp;opportunities to leverage other NGA contracts in order to minimize the amount of work being sole-sourced under Kalypso.&nbsp; Please note that COMPASS is not part of the approved ceiling authority.</p>
