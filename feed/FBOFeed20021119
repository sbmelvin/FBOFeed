<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (BAA-03-01-FH) constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this notice will be issued, requests for the same will be disregarded. INTRODUCTION:  The Department of Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Division, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca, AZ, acting as the contracting agent for the Personnel Security Research Center (PERSEREC), is issuing a BAA to solicit research proposals addressing issues pertinent to personnel security policy.  Multiple acquisition awards are anticipated with typical periods of performance of 12 months including final reports and/or demonstrations.  Information in this BAA is supplemented by a Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) that provides further information on the eligibility, support, research areas, multidisciplinary approaches, preparation and submission of proposals, and selection criteria available from the World Wide Web at http://www.nbc.gov/persecbaa.cfm.  This pamphlet may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, or official mail.  Send requests for PIP to the Department of Interior, Fort Huachuca by email to Lawrence_H_Carter@nbc.gov or call 520-533-1213. TECHNICAL AND RESEARCH AREAS:  The technical areas covered by this funding program include financial and credit, candidate screening and crime detection procedures, prescreening, background investigation, adjudication, continuing evaluation, employee assistance programs, security awareness, and security education.  By providing financial support for masters thesis, doctoral dissertations and institutional research, PERSEREC intends to respond to needs identified by the industrial and personnel security research communities and to reiterate the Department of Defense's commitment to fostering innovation within the field of personnel security.  There are four (4) research areas involved in this solicitation: (1) Vetting Systems; (2) Continuing Evaluation; (3) Automated Systems for Personnel Security; and (4) Trust Betrayal.  A brief description of each research area is as follows: Vetting Systems:  DoD personnel security vetting systems have three principle components: prescreening, a background investigation, and an adjudication that determines an individual's eligibility for a particular position.  A variety of policies and procedures exist in DoD to vet individuals for employment suitability, access to classified information, suitability for other positions of trust, and reliability for handling nuclear material for weapons.  Our research in this area aims to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and fairness of these personnel security vetting systems.  Continuing Evaluation:  This area involves research aimed at helping to ensure the continued reliability, trustworthiness and loyalty of cleared personnel.  We hope to systematically examine and improve three key post-vetting functions of personnel security systems: monitoring or continuing evaluation, security education, and intervention and employee assistance.  Mentoring or continuing evaluation includes the reporting of information that may bear on an individual's continued eligibility to hold a clearance or have access to privileged information.  Security education focuses on enhancing in the minds of trusted employees an awareness of the threat and of human and technical vulnerabilities to adversaries.  Finally, intervention and employee assistance looks at how security programs can help cleared individuals with personal problems seek assistance and thereby maintain their security clearance eligibility.   Automated Systems for Personnel Security:  The primary aim of research in this area is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the investigative process by developing systems that electronically acquire and analyze relevant investigative data from commercial and government databases.  Research that would help design or develop systems to detect and deter financial irresponsible or illegal activity is of interest.  Research pertinent to automated systems that incorporate other types of individual data useful for continuing evaluation and counterintelligence purposes would also be helpful. Trust Betrayal:  The research in this area is focused on understanding the phenomenon of trust betrayal, particularly espionage.  There has been no shortage of journalistic and biographic writing about individual American spies and their stories.  However, there is a continuing need to put this data together into an organized framework so that we can generate comparative analyses and arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of espionage and other forms of trust betrayal.  This should yield information useful to security and counterintelligence policymakers as well as those responsible for security and threat awareness training and education.  A recent emphasis in trust betrayal research is a focus on ensuring the continued reliability of IT personnel entrusted with the administration and control of Defense information systems.  These personnel may or may not have access to classified information, but have the potential for rendering our operational systems, and the sensitive information they contain, vulnerable to adversarial interests. PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to pay for proposal preparation costs.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or to any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort.  Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government.  Any responsible offeror considering itself capable of satisfying the needs identified in this BAA may submit a proposal.  Further, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or servable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA will remain open through 15 July 2003 for the purposes of receiving proposals.  In order to be considered for an award, proposals must be received by the Department of Interior at the Administrative Address identified below on or before 15 July 2003.  Proposals received after the closing date of this BAA will not be considered.  PERSEREC will, on a continuing basis, evaluate and fund, through the Department of Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Division, Southwest Branch, selected proposals received at any time during the open period.  As soon as the proposal evaluation is completed, the proposer will be notified of selectability or non-selectability.  Selectable proposals will be considered for funding; non-selectable proposals will be retained for filing purposes. FORMAT:  The proposal solicited under this BAA must be self-contained (no videos) and no longer than 25 pages excluding curriculum vitae.  The page format shall be 12 point or larger type, single spaced, one inch margins, single sided, 8.5 by 11 inch pages.

<DESC>17.	The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) plans to establish a Coast Guard Information Technology Services Solutions (CGITSS) Multiple Award Contract (MAC).  CGITSS will provide for the full range of IT service solutions for the U.S. Coast Guard, with the potential for use by organizations performing Homeland Security functions within the same department as the Coast Guard, through four primary support services functional areas:  Information Management Analysis and Planning (MAP), Information Systems Engineering (ISE) and Design, Information Systems Operations and Management (SOM), and Information Systems Security (ISS).  The attached draft requirements document contains additional information on these functional areas and the anticipated labor categories.  CGITSS will provide contracting opportunities for full and open competition, as well as set-asides for small business, 8(a), and HUBzone in all functional areas. The anticipated NAICS codes are 541511, 541512, 541513, and 541519.  The Small Business size standard is $21.0M.  CGITSS contracts will be awarded to vendors in all functional areas for which they are determined to provide the best value to the government taking technical capability, management approach, past performance and pricing into consideration.  Therefore, a vendor may receive a CGITSS contract that includes all four functional areas, three functional areas, two functional areas, or just one functional area.  CGITSS contracts will promote the use of performance based contracting, however, contracts will also accommodate the issuance of task orders for all types of pricing arrangements (firm-fixed price, time & material, cost-plus fixed fee, labor hours).  CGITSS contracts will allow for various incentive contracting features, including award fee and award term.  This means that the opportunity will exist for CGITSS contracts/task orders to go beyond the normal 5-year performance period, with possible maximum performance periods of up to 15 years.  In addition, CGITSS will require pre-approval of prime contractors teaming partners/subcontractors.  Interested vendors are invited to attend one of two planned Industry Days to be held from 9:00 A.M. till 11:00 A.M. on December 16, 2002 and from 1:30 P.M till 3:30 P.M. on December 17, 2002 at the Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590.  The purpose of the Industry Day sessions is to kick-off the CGITSS MAC project, review the functional areas and labor categories with industry, provide additional information regarding CGITSS, provide a forum for industry to pose questions regarding the project, and obtain from industry lessons learned from their involvement with other MAC and Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs).  If you cannot attend an Industry Day session, you will NOT be precluded from competing for CGITSS contracts, and, you WILL be able to pose questions regarding CGITSS to the contacts identified herein even after Industry Day.   Vendors interested in attending one of the Industry Day sessions must make an advance reservation in response to this announcement.  Due to limited seating, vendors are limited to sending one representative to one Industry Day session.  Reservations must be made by e-mail to Brenda Peterson, bpeterson@comdt.uscg.mil and Dani Wildason, dwildason@comdt.uscg.mil no later than 3:00 P.M. EST on December 6, 2002.  Telephone reservations and inquiries will not be accepted.  The subject line of the e-mail should read CGITSS and the e-mail should contain only the following information:  the name of the person requesting attendance at Industry Day, full corporate name and mailing address, attendees telephone number, attendees fax number, attendees e-mail address, and preference of Industry Day dates.  These e-mail responses shall NOT contain any attachments, corporate capabilities or other corporate marketing information.  Seating at Industry Day is on a first come, first serve basis.  All vendors who respond to this announcement will receive an e-mail either confirming their attendance of an Industry Day session or indicating that their reservation could not be confirmed due to unavailability of seating.  Note that we will NOT be entertaining any questions regarding CGITSS as a result of this announcement at this time. Vendors are encouraged to submit their questions in writing at Industry Day.  Future information regarding CGITSS, including a complete list of Industry Day attendees, a complete list of all questions posed at both Industry Days and CG responses thereto, and all other vendor questions/CG responses throughout the CGITSS acquisition process, will be released to the public through this website.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Teresa Lee-Fierstein, Contract Specialist, (617) 494-3830
<DESC>NA In support of the Federal Railroad Administrations (FRA) Office of Research and Development, the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has been conducting research into rail equipment crashworthiness.  The information from this research has been used by the FRA and Amtrak to develop the crashworthiness requirements for the high-speed trainset, and by the FRA to develop initial regulations for passenger equipment.  Information from this research is currently being used by the American Public Transit Association (APTA) to develop industry standards and recommended practices for passenger equipment crashworthiness.  The FRA is currently planning to expand and update further its passenger equipment regulations.  Revisions and additions to current locomotive crashworthine ss requirements are currently being considered by the Railway Safety Advisory Committee (RSAC).  The Volpe Center intends to issue a competitive solicitation to provide engineering services to support the ongoing rail equipment crashworthiness Volpe Center research project.  Specialized engineering skills and test expertise are sought to assure that the Volpe Center will have on call the depth of capabilities to quickly respond to requests from the FRA for assessments of the crashworthiness of rail equipment.  The overall objective of this contract is to conduct studies to develop and evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of concepts for improved rail equipment crashworthiness.  Examples of concepts for improved crashworthiness include the incorporation of crush-zones at the end of ca rs to better preserve the occupied areas of the train, and lap and shoulder belts for occupant restraint.  Information to be developed under this contract is expected to help form the technical basis for the rail equipment crashworthiness specifications and regulations.  The scope includes collision risk analyses, and analysis, design, and test of rail equipment structural crashworthiness and occupant protection.  Risk analyses include the determination of the collision scenarios of concern and their probability of occurrence.  Such analyses may include determination of the costs and benefits associated with crashworthiness concepts.  Structural crashworthiness includes evaluations of structures with large deformations and evaluations of train collision dynamics (i.e., the trajectories of  the cars of train during the collision).  Interior crashworthiness includes evaluation of the forces and accelerations acting on occupants during collision, as well as evaluation of occupant trajectories.  The scope of structural and interior crashworthiness efforts includes design development of concepts for improved crashworthiness.  Task orders within the scope of this contract may be issued in any one or combination of the following three areas:  (1) Risk Analysis; (2) Structural Crashworthiness; and (3) Occupant Protection.  An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee provisions is anticipated.  The estimated Level of Effort is 37,000 labor hours.  The term of the contract will be five years from date of award.  Multiple awards may be considered.   The solicitation will be released using full and open competition.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690.  Estimated release date is January 6, 2003.  Anticipated award date is April 1, 2003.  The Volpe Center uses electronic commerce to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs.  Paper copies of the RFP or amendments will not be issued. The solicitation and any document related to this procurement will be available on the Internet; these documents will be available in text format and reside on a WWW server, which may be accessed using Web browsers.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, N.J. (NAWCADLKE) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to procure a series of temperature calibration baths from Hart Scientific, Inc. 799 E. Utah Valley Drive, American Fork, UT 84003-9775 to update/replace the current inventory of older model temperature baths.  This procurement will be for commercial off the shelf items (COTS).  A sources sought request was previously advertised in September, 2002 along with technical specifications.  Only one company responded (Hart Scientific, Inc).  A total of 57 baths with accessories (19 baths each of three model numbers) will be purchased.  An initial basic quantity of 6 baths is planned with follow-on options available up to the full quantity. Hart model numbers include: 7040 low temperature unit, 6020 medium temperature unit and the 6050H high temperature unit.  Accessories include fluid level adapters (all units), economy clamp kits (all units), fast start heater (high temp unit) and bath fluid (all units).  

Specifications: The temperature bath or baths must be commercially available, "off the shelf" items with existing product specifications, manuals, technical information and test results that can be made available for comprehensive review and/or evaluation as required.  As previously stated, this is NOT a developmental item and, as such, the Navy's goal is to avoid the prolonged waits, developmental costs and re-engineering associated with developmental type procurements. A minimum initial quantity (approx 6) is planned followed by government-discretion options for additional quantities.
Due to the NAVAIR Metrology and Calibration Program accuracy requirements for these temperature baths, limited sources of supply were expected.  Temperature bath standards are used primarily in NAVAIR depot-level calibration facilities, including the regional labs, Mobil Calibration Complexes (MCCs) and several FCAs (field calibration activities) having special capability.  These standards are used to support a wide range of workload items that cannot physically fit into the Portable Temperature Calibrators (PTCs) and/or require a higher degree of calibration accuracy than the PTCs can provide.  Furthermore, their larger access opening size enables calibration of the multiple Test Instruments (TIs) simultaneously.  The following provides a listing of several types of TIs that are calibrated with the temperature baths:
Liquid In Glass Thermometers, Bi-Metallic Thermometers, Remote Indicating Thermometers, Temperature Switches, Thermistors, Digital Multimeters, Pyrometers. Digital Indicators, Thermocouple Thermometers, and Digital Thermometers
Unless otherwise indicated, the specifications below are written around a single bath; although, it may be necessary to employ a system of baths in order to satisfy all of the requirements (see MULTIPLE BATH UNITS). The requirements for the temperature baths are as follows: The temperature bath shall operate on 115 VAC and less than 20 amps. The temperature bath shall have a drainage system to permit drainage of the bath fluid. The bath, or system of baths, shall cover a temperature range of -40 ?F to 1000 ?F.
The bath and corresponding bath fluid shall be chosen such that they can be safely operated over the required temperature range (provided in TEMPERATURE RANGE) and the permissible exposure limits set forth in the 29 Code Of Federal Regulations 1910 (Occupational Safety and Health Standards) for any substances generated or intrinsic to the specific bath fluids without requiring the use of a fume hood. 

Navy testing has indicated that certain bath fluids used over specific temperature ranges will not exceed the Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL) and Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) set forth in the 29 Code Of Federal Regulations 1910: 
Dow Corning Corporation- Dow Corning 200? Fluid, 5 CST:  -40 to 80 ?C
Dow Corning Corporation- Dow Corning 200? Fluid, 50 CST:  60 to 180 ?C
Heatbath Corporation- Tempering A-HTS PINK/PETRO AG: 180 to 550?C
Although the temperature bath mediums are not limited to those indicated above, any and all conditions outside those previously stated must demonstrate the capability of satisfying the exposure limits set forth in the 29 Code Of Federal Regulations 1910 without the use of a fume hood or other similar ventilation device.  Documented proof by an accredited Occupational Safety and Health Standards Agency must be provided.
The stability for the bath and fluid shall be 0.011 ?F (0.006 ?C) or better at any temperature set point within the temperature range requirements for approximately a 30-minute duration (sufficient time for TI to stabilize and to make a measurement).  This stability shall be achievable while using the same fluid (see TEMPERATURE BATH MEDIUM, section 1).  If multiple bath units are necessary to cover the temperature range, then each bath shall provide the aforementioned stability over the range the bath and fluid will be used.  A stirring mechanism within the bath is preferred in order to expedite and maintain stability and uniformity throughout the bath fluid or medium.
The temperature bath shall be able to provide a minimum immersion depth of 12 inches.  The access opening shall be at least 4" in diameter (circular), 4" x 4" (rectangular or square) or equivalent.  Larger access opening is preferred to facilitate the calibration of multiple workload items simultaneously. The working volume shall be comprised of, at a minimum, a depth of 12 inches and a diameter of 4 inches.  This volume shall be unobstructed.
The temperature bath medium shall be chosen such that the following hold:
1)	One bath fluid or medium for the temperature range over which the bath will be used.  If more than one bath is used to cover the temperature range requirement (-40 to 1000 ?F), then a bath fluid shall be selected such that it is not necessary to change / exchange the fluid in order to cover the range over which the bath will be used.
2)	The use of the bath fluid or medium over the operating temperature range of the bath shall not require the use of a fume hood as a result of hazardous substances (i.e., fumes/vapors) generated by the fluids and/or to remove displaced particles (i.e., aluminum oxide, sand, etc.) in the air due to use.
3)	To reiterate from the TEMPERATURE STABILITY requirement, the bath fluid or medium shall satisfy the stability requirement over the temperature range requirement.  If more than one bath is used to satisfy the temperature range requirement, then the fluid in each bath shall be stable over the entire temperature range that the bath is used.
A label with the maximum safe operating temperature in accordance with the temperature bath medium requirements (section TEMPERATURE BATH MEDIUM) is preferred.  If the temperature bath is capable of operating at temperatures that exceed the safe operating temperature range of the bath fluid, there shall be some mechanism to prevent the operator from operating the bath beyond the safe operating temperature of the bath fluid.  Additionally, there shall be some mechanism to disable the unit or shut the unit down in the event of thermal runaway. The temperature display shall provide a visual indication of the current bath temperature. The temperature bath display shall provide a set-point resolution of 0.001 ?C / ?F or better. The temperature controller shall accept a desired temperature set point and the bath able to achieve that set point within an acceptable time period. See heating and cooling below. The temperature display shall provide temperature indications in the following measurement units: Celsius (?C) and Fahrenheit (?F).  The bath shall permit the calibration of a test instrument at a minimum of 4 equally spaced test points (including -40 ?F and 1000 ?F as the minimum and maximum test point values, respectively) within a 6-hour period.  This time period includes the time necessary for the bath and the corresponding fluid to heat and/or cool while in transit to the test points and also to stabilize with the test instrument and/or standard monitoring device for measurements made at all four test points.
There shall be a mechanism/fixture that permits the bath fluid or medium to be brought to a suitable working depth for particular workload such as the liquid in glass thermometers and short-stem dial thermometers.  This fluid-leveling capability may result from the actual construction of the bath or an appropriate adjustable leveling fixture that permits the TI to be brought to the level of the bath fluid. Although a single bath capable of satisfying all of the requirements is desired, there are limitations imposed by the bath fluids themselves.  Hence, it may be necessary to employ a system of baths in order to satisfy the requirements. If more than one bath is necessary to satisfy the requirements (i.e., cover the temperature range), the following shall be considered during the evaluation (i.e., all else being equal, a three-bath system occupying only x amount of space will be selected over another system occupying 2x amount of space):
1.	Combined total volume of the system, including additional equipment necessary for operation (i.e., compressor).

<DESC>Request for Information General Information Document Type:	 Request for Information  Contracting Office:  	Department of the Air Force, HQ SSG Standard System Group, Directorate of 		Contracting, 490 East Moore Dr.  Suite 270 MAFB-Gunter Annex AL  36114-3000 Solicitation Number:  N/A   Classification Code:	  D- Information Technology Services, Including Telecommunication Services   Description:  Seeking qualified vendors capable of providing the Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) with a software solution designed to optimize transactions processing between clients and database servers connected through Wide Area Networks (WANs) using modern, industry wide languages and tools.  The expected improvements are faster response times from client perspective, increase in clients serviced on the server side and better bandwidth utilization.  The communications software solution shall be transparent to CMOS application, that is, no changes have to be implemented to CMOS source code.  In addition, communication not intended for clients shall move freely in and out of database server without the need to be processed by the communication software solution.  CMOS is a combat support system that provides automated base level processing for cargo movement during peacetime and both deployment cargo and passenger movement during contingencies for the Air Expeditionary Forces.  The architecture used by the CMOS application consists of a three tier server-client model.  The CMOS client application is based on Oracle forms and it can be installed over Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT (SP4 and above), Windows 2000 Pro (SP2 and above).  There also plans for adding the Windows XP Pro operating system.  The CMOS server application is based on Oracle 8.0 and it is installed over an HP-UX 11.0 operating system.  The database servers operate in a backup mode, that is, when the primary server fails a standby or backup server takes over.  The communication protocol used for data exchange between client and server is TCP/IP connection oriented protocol combined with SQL*Net protocol and Net8.  The bit mode for this application is 32 bits, although the bit mode can go as high as 64 bits in modern servers.  The CMOS program is migrating its application to the concept of regionalized servers in which database servers are placed at strategic DISA locations throughout continental United States and outside United States.  The application clients located at Air Force bases connect to regionalized database servers that are closest to their locations using WAN connectivity through the NIPRENET.  Interested vendors should submit their capabilities information via email: sherrita.muse@gunter.af.mil or mail to: HQ SSG/PKZ-2, 490 East.  Moore Drive, Suite 270 (Bldg. 892), Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex AL 36114-3004.   Please specify whether the firm is a large business, small business, very small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  Also, specify if the firm is U.S. or foreign-owned.  All responses should be received on or before COB 27 Nov 2002.  This is a request for information only.  No solicitation will be generated or contract awarded as a result of this request.   Additionally, the Air Force will not pay for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted in response to this request for information.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541519   Contracting Office Address and Point of Contact: Environmental Protection Agency, Information Resources Management Procurement Service Center, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Rm. 3803R, Washington, D.C. 20460.  Contact: Anthony W. Pellegrino, Contract Specialist, (202)  564-6095; Facsimile: (202) 565-2559; pellegrino.anthony@epa.gov.  Description: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 13,  with Salesforce.com ("Salesforce") for a web-based, Customer Relationship  Management database system, commonly referred to as CRM.  The CRM database system will be used to automate the recruiting and customer service components of the EPA's Transportation and Regional Program Division's (TRPD) Commuter Choice Leadership Initiative (CCLI).  Briefly, the CCLI is a  voluntary partnership-based program aimed at reducing the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) each year through the promotion of commuter alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles. A complete description of the CCLI is available at http://www.commuterchoice.gov.  Goals of the CRM database  management system are to automate the process of identifying companies that are good candidates for the CCLI program, provide information needed to persuade companies to join the program, provide technical assistance to CCLI members and to facilitate the exchange of information among CCLI members.  Currently, there is not an EPA Agency Standard for web-based CRM database systems.  TRPD is approved by the Office of Environmental Information (OEI) to procure its CRM on a pilot basis.  TRPD and OEI will jointly review the results and efficacy of this CRM system.  EPA source research indicates  that Salesforce is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement because:  (1) the system it designed, sells and maintains uses a "net-native" architecture; (2) the charges associated with use of its system are scaled to the number of users; (3) the scaled charges are available on a  lease-by-number-of-users basis; and (4) the system provides a method to track and automate the customer service component of the CRM dynamic. Finally, Salesforce is the only company capable of providing and hosting Salesforce.com software.  A draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) setting forth  the specifics of the requirement is available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/.  Any firm deeming itself capable of performing in accordance with the SOW is encouraged to submit technical documentation in support thereof.  Documents should clearly detail all capabilities to perform in accordance with  the criteria set forth in the SOW. All documents must be submitted within 10 days of electronic posting of this notice.  No solicitation or request for quotations (RFQ) is available.  Therefore, routine letters or other inquiries requesting a copy of the solicitation or RFQ are irrelevant,  non-responsive and will be ignored.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to undertake competitive  procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541519.  Documents and inquiries shall be directed to Anthony W. Pellegrino using one (1) of the following methods: Facsimile  (202) 565-2559 or e-mail: pellegrino.anthony@epa.gov referencing Solicitation Number RFQ-DC-00061.

The Grantee for the project is Puertos de Anzo?tegui S.A. (PASA), a corporation created by the State Government of Anzo?tegui to administer the public and commercial ports within Anzo?tegui.

Within Anzo?tegui, PASA manages both public and private port facilities, the most important being the Port of Guanta, which has an approximate length of 1,100 meters and has a capacity for between six and eight large cargo ships.  

In order to ensure optimal service and increase and improve cargo-handling capacity for both imports and exports, a rehabilitation and expansion plan for the port was presented by PASA for US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) feasibility study funding.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $225,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1621 N.

In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>2840
<RESPDATE>112902
<CONTACT>Dixie Harper, (202)
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a competitive contract to utilize a National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) accredited Common Criteria Testing Laboratory  (CCTL) for Information Technology Security Evaluations of two FAA programs, the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) program and the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS).  Protection Profiles have been developed for both programs.  The purpose of this announcement is to solicit interested sources with the ability to participate in this procurement. <P> The FTI program will provide integrated voice, data, and video telecommunications services CONUS-wide, with connectivity to Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. territories, for administrative and the U.S. National Airspace (NAS) mission-critical traffic.   FTI telecommunications requirements are expressed in terms of service classes and service interfaces.   <P> FTI is responsible for providing security services for ISO/OSI levels 1-3 from Service Delivery Point (SDP) to SDP for telecommunications services, and ISO/OSI levels 1-7 for the Network Management and Operations (NMO), and Integrated Business System (IBS).  FTI does not provide application or facility level security.  <P> FTI is a composite Target of Evaluation (TOE) that consists of three component TOEs: Telecommunications Services (TS), NMO, and IBS.   The NMO and IBS TOEs are self-contained.  The TS TOE is composed of 10 packages: 	BV1 - basic voice 	BD1 - basic data 	EV1 - voice closed user groups 	ED2 - encryption for IP or non-IP traffic 	ED3 - virtual private networks 	ED4 - secure Extranets 	ED5 - X.25 closed user groups 	ED6 - packet filtering firewalls 	ED7 - bastion host firewalls 	DS - dedicated transmission service <P> The FTI contractor is required to demonstrate Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) three (EAL-3) augmented for all three component TOEs. <P> The FTI invoice review, validation, and reconciliation services are under the Invoice and Financial Management Services (IFMS) contract.  IFMS consists of three component Targets of Evaluation (TOEs):  (1) Information retrieval from external sources, (2) Information analysis, manipulation, and storage, and (3) Information transmission to external sources.  The IFMS contractor is required to demonstrate EAL-2 for the three component TOEs.  <P> The ultimate goal of FTI security engineering activities is to ensure that: (1) FTI passes the initial FAA security certification and authorization, so that it may be deployed into the U.S. National Airspace (NAS), and (2) FTI maintains a stable security posture so that the mandatory tri-annual security certification and authorization activities are successful.  The FTI Program Office views the formal evaluation activities that will be conducted by the Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL) as an input to the FAA security certification and authorization process.   <P> The FAA requires any vendor interested in the FTI Common Criteria Security Evaluation (FCCSE) procurement to meet the following requirements: <P> 1.	Must be a United States owned and operated company. <P> 2.	Have a current as well as a past history of Common Criteria Testing Laboratory accreditation issued by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP).  As part of the NIAP accreditation process labs must meet the requirements of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) and  comply with the Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS).  The  NIAP accreditation is the primary requirement for becoming a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory.  <P> 3.	Have experience in Wide Area (backbone telecommunications) Network (WAN) security testing and accreditation.  <P> 4.	May not participate with the FTI prime contractor on the Information System Security Verification (ISSV), in the preparation of the FTI security documentation, or the development of the security architecture. <P> The closing date for this announcement is November 29, 2002.  Contractors who meet the above requirements are encouraged to submit a not to exceed 3-page paper specifically addressing the four points stated above.  The paper should be submitted (e-mail is acceptable) no later than 4:00 P.M. December 5, 2002.  The FAA will review all qualification statements and make a down-select decision based on those that meet the above qualifications and are most likely to receive the award.  The solicitation will be issued to the down-selected vendors, only. <P> If there are questions or comments, please contact Dixie Harper at dixie.harper@faa.gov. <P>

<DESC>NA **THIS IS A REVISION OF A PREVIOUS NOTICE:** The Corps of Engineers is compiling a list of SBA certified 8(a) OR HubZone Firms that have the capabilities to provide the following contruction efforts for a future requirement: the project would include the f ollowing features: (1) Extension of the existing 4' by 8' concrete twin box culvert from Berry Street to Elm Street in Dover for a length of about 1,640 feet and the associated relocation of existing utilities; (2) Replacement of the two existing Rockaway Town Square Mall detention basin outlet structu res to reduce peak outflow rates and (3) Channel improvements (gabions) along approximately 150 feet of McKeel Brook to provide streambank stabilization. Seasonal restrictions will be a factor in scheduling t he conduct of the work. Environmental windows wi ll limit any tree clearing activities to the period between March and November. Also, culvert work in Dover Township may occur only during the summer months when school is not in session. The estimated Const ruction Cost Range of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The duration of the project is approximately 540 calendar days. This compilation is necessary to enable the COE to determine if an available pool of qualified 8(a) OR HubZonw firms a re available to compete for this effort. Interest ed firms are instructed to contact Ed Lew via e-mail at edward.t.lew@nan02.usace.army.mil, or on company letterhead, to Ed Lew, 26 Federal Plaza, CENAN-CT, Room 1843, New York, NY 10278-0090. and provide do cumentation that illustrates the firms capabilities and prior efforts that are similar to the subject construction effort. This announcement does not imply that the Government is obligated to award this effort in the future. All interested and qualified 8( a) OR HubZone Firms are encouraged to reply. Upon conclusion of the compilation, if the Government has determined that the qualified pool is not significant enough for a restricted competition, this requirement, if advertised, may be solicited as an unrest ricted requirement.

2002?
Due date has changed to December 19, 2002.
2. Can you clarify a statement that was made at the pre-submittal meeting on
November 5, 2002, and answer a question for me. On the Socio-Economic
Goals Chart the following information was given:
49% Small Business
5% Small Disadvantaged Business
5% Woman Owned Small Business
Does this mean that 50% of this project will be to a combined group of Small
Business, Small Disadvantaged Business and Women Owned Small Business?
No, the 40% represent the total Small business amount. The 40%
includes the Hubzone small business (2%), small disadvantaged (5%),
women - owned small business (5%), veteran-owned small business (3%),
and service-disabled veteran-owned small business (3%). Note that of the
40% to all small business firms, 18% is going to the minority category
and the remaining 22% is going to other non-minority small business
firms.
Secondly, can you explain what is meant by the ?Small Business
Competitiveness Demonstration Program.??
Yes. The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program was
established to (a) test the ability of small businesses to compete
successfully in certain industry categories without competition being
restricted by the use of small business set-asides, (b) measure the extent to
which awards are made to a new category of small businesses known as
emerging small businesses (ESB's), and to provide for certain acquisitions
to be reserved for ESB participation only, and (c) expand small business
participation in 10 targeted industry categories through continued use of
set-aside procedures, increased management attention, and specifically
tailored acquisition procedures.

services under this contract shall be performed under the direction/supervision
of professional architects and/or engineers with substantial construction

Yes, this is required for the members of the CM team who provide
direction/supervision and professional services oversight.

want the CM to include in its team design architects and engineers to check

through the design/build phase and will review construction drawings for
design intent compliance only. The CM will provide design review
services for conformance with the Bridging documents.
9. During construction phase, will the CM team be responsible for providing a
full time on site inspector of record to check code conformance.

experience, GSA will consider this along with your design experience.
11/18/02

construction phase teams in Stage I.

selected prior to the 03 December 02 submittal date or after any job fair for

<RESPDATE>112902
<CONTACT>Dixie Harper, (202)
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a competitive contract to utilize a National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) accredited Common Criteria Testing Laboratory  (CCTL) for Information Technology Security Evaluations of two FAA programs, the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) program and the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS).  Protection Profiles have been developed for both programs.  The purpose of this announcement is to solicit interested sources with the ability to participate in this procurement. <P> The FTI program will provide integrated voice, data, and video telecommunications services CONUS-wide, with connectivity to Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. territories, for administrative and the U.S. National Airspace (NAS) mission-critical traffic.   FTI telecommunications requirements are expressed in terms of service classes and service interfaces.   <P> FTI is responsible for providing security services for ISO/OSI levels 1-3 from Service Delivery Point (SDP) to SDP for telecommunications services, and ISO/OSI levels 1-7 for the Network Management and Operations (NMO), and Integrated Business System (IBS).  FTI does not provide application or facility level security.  <P> FTI is a composite Target of Evaluation (TOE) that consists of three component TOEs: Telecommunications Services (TS), NMO, and IBS.   The NMO and IBS TOEs are self-contained.  The TS TOE is composed of 10 packages: 	BV1 - basic voice 	BD1 - basic data 	EV1 - voice closed user groups 	ED2 - encryption for IP or non-IP traffic 	ED3 - virtual private networks 	ED4 - secure Extranets 	ED5 - X.25 closed user groups 	ED6 - packet filtering firewalls 	ED7 - bastion host firewalls 	DS - dedicated transmission service <P> The FTI contractor is required to demonstrate Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) three (EAL-3) augmented for all three component TOEs. <P> The FTI invoice review, validation, and reconciliation services are under the Invoice and Financial Management Services (IFMS) contract.  IFMS consists of three component Targets of Evaluation (TOEs):  (1) Information retrieval from external sources, (2) Information analysis, manipulation, and storage, and (3) Information transmission to external sources.  The IFMS contractor is required to demonstrate EAL-2 for the three component TOEs.  <P> The ultimate goal of FTI security engineering activities is to ensure that: (1) FTI passes the initial FAA security certification and authorization, so that it may be deployed into the U.S. National Airspace (NAS), and (2) FTI maintains a stable security posture so that the mandatory tri-annual security certification and authorization activities are successful.  The FTI Program Office views the formal evaluation activities that will be conducted by the Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL) as an input to the FAA security certification and authorization process.   <P> The FAA requires any vendor interested in the FTI Common Criteria Security Evaluation (FCCSE) procurement to meet the following requirements: <P> 1.	Must be a United States owned and operated company. <P> 2.	Have a current as well as a past history of Common Criteria Testing Laboratory accreditation issued by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP).  As part of the NIAP accreditation process labs must meet the requirements of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) and  comply with the Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS).  The  NIAP accreditation is the primary requirement for becoming a Common Criteria Testing Laboratory.  <P> 3.	Have experience in Wide Area (backbone telecommunications) Network (WAN) security testing and accreditation.  <P> 4.	May not participate with the FTI prime contractor on the Information System Security Verification (ISSV), in the preparation of the FTI security documentation, or the development of the security architecture. <P> The closing date for this announcement is November 29, 2002.  Contractors who meet the above requirements are encouraged to submit a not to exceed 3-page paper specifically addressing the four points stated above.  The paper should be submitted (e-mail is acceptable) no later than 4:00 P.M. December 5, 2002.  The FAA will review all qualification statements and make a down-select decision based on those that meet the above qualifications and are most likely to receive the award.  The solicitation will be issued to the down-selected vendors, only. <P> If there are questions or comments, please contact Dixie Harper at dixie.harper@faa.gov. <P>

Activities include: (1) weapon effectiveness analysis, systems design and evaluations, and operational studies for counterforce strikes against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) and other asymmetric threats; (2) CBRNE target and intelligence assessments; (3) nuclear weapon modifications assessments, life extension assessments, system and component analysis, and management from operational deployment through retirement; (4) technical and programmatic oversight, technical interchange participation and documentation including summary reports of Nuclear Weapons Project Officers Groups (POGs).  Nuclear weapon and counterproliferation solution concepts are developed and fielded through the USAF, DoD, and DOE acquisition processes to meet user requirements and ensure continued mission readiness, operation, and reliability certification throughout their lifetime.  Interaction between the USAF, DoD, and DOE agencies occurs through integrated product teams led by AF NWCA.  To support this objective, NWCA is interested in augmenting their technical and engineering expertise in the following major areas, to be performed at the contractor?s facility and on-site at NWCA, Kirtland AFB, NM: (A) program management, (B) engineering, (C) scientific, (D) computational, (E) analysis, (F) testing, (G) technical reporting/documentation, (H) targeting/intelligence, (I) office administration and (J) network administration.  A primary objective of the overall effort is the integration of all these areas to support NWCA programs such as nuclear stockpile sustainment and life extension; agent defeat weapons concept development; and targeting and collateral effects tools development and application. Contractual effort is contemplated to be a 60-month effort with an anticipated ceiling of $20M.   A cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) completion type contract is contemplated.  Small businesses having the capability to perform this work are invited to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to determine whether the acquisition should be set aside for small businesses.

This is not a Request For Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Any costs incurred as a result of this announcement shall be borne by the offeror and will not be charged to the Government for reimbursement. Small businesses are encouraged to team in order to demonstrate the capability to do more than 50% of the effort.  All respondents desiring a copy of future solicitations must provide a point of contact, complete mailing address, telephone and fax number, and email address.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to negotiate for a seven-year contract with the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.   The nature of the contract is to maintain the Arbovirus Reference Collection, and support research and service activities of the World Reference Center for Arboviruses,  which are both located at the University.  The activities conducted by the WRCA include: (1) virus identification and characterization; (2) investigation and diagnosis of disease outbreaks; (3) preparation and distribution of certified virus stocks and reagents; (4) development of new animal models of arboviral diseases, (5) training professional and technical personnel from any region of the world in arbovirus techniques and (6) dissemination of information on arbovirus taxonomy, diagnostic techniques and disease outbreaks.  Because of the WRCAs extensive virus reference collection, unique diagnostic capabilities and contacts with virologists and public health laboratories throughout the world, it is uniquely qualified to perform this work. The University of Texas has spent 29 years establishing and maintaining the Arbovirus Reference Collection and the WRCA.  This expertise and experience are essential to the effort.  The public health importance of the proposed work makes delays in initiating and completing a new Arbovirus collection and WRCA unacceptable.  Also, competition is unfeasible, because it is more cost effective to maintain the current Arbovirus collection and the WRCA at the University of Texas than to duplicate it elsewhere.  Therefore, the government intends to proceed with a sole source award under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.   See Government-wide Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Point of Contact: Erin Goldstein, Contract Specialist, 6700B Rockledge Drive, MSC 7612, Room 2230, Bethesda, MD  20892-7612.

<SUBJECT>79 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company?s overall financial status.  The following items are being considered: Rough and Ready Mop (Medium) (7920-00-NIB-0409); and Rough and Ready Mop (Large) (7920-00-NIB-0410.
In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm?s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

INSTALLATION AND UTILITY SYSTEMS DESCRIPTIONS: Note:  (1) All technical data and information listed below is to be considered either an estimated quantity or an approximate order of magnitude. (2)  Some personnel likely will be required to be qualified radiation workers to access facilities within controlled areas.  SR will provide the required Radcon training. Description of Facilities:  The drinking water systems at the Savannah River Site are complete, independent systems comprised of Government owned treatment facilities, elevated storage tanks, wells, and distribution piping.  Some of the water produced by these systems is used for equipment cooling, fire protection water, and make-up water for cooling water systems.  Also included in this scope of work is the operation and maintenance of an on-site drinking water bottling facility. Components:  Distribution Systems--The main drinking water system is comprised of a primary looped pipeline totaling approximately 27 miles of 10? PVC piping.  There are 8 secondary loops being supplied from this primary loop totaling approximately 41 miles of piping of various materials and sizes. Major Treatment Systems--There are 4 separate major treatment facilities, with one serving as a back-up facility when the primary facility is out of service for maintenance or repair.  The treatment capacity is approximately 8 Million Gallons per Day (MGD), although the average demand is approximately 1 MGD. Treatment is accomplished by chemical injection.  Wells--The major systems are supplied by a total of 8 wells.  The other small systems are supplied by their own dedicated wells.  Storage Tanks--The major water systems are comprised of 5 elevated storage tanks, ranging in capacity from 100,000 gallons to 650,000 gallons.  Bottled Water Facility--This is an on-site facility which produces approximately 3000 bottles per month (5 gallon bottles). Miscellaneous--There are 7 separate water systems classified as small systems which serve less than 25 people each.  There are also 8 ultra small systems that are non-potable and are used for hand washing and toilets.  These systems are serviced by individual wells and treatment systems.  The small systems are disbursed over the Savannah River Site.  The most remote systems are approximately 25 miles from the main treatment facility. The operation of the above systems falls under the regulations of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC).  SCDHEC Regulation R.61-58 specifically governs drinking water, and is the standard applied at SRS and with which a contractor would have to comply.  A copy of this regulation may be accessed on the Internet at www.scdhec.net.

The Dual Use cooperative agreement opportunity described in this notice is one method of accomplishing this objective.  The purpose of the Dual Use program is to integrate the commercialization process into development projects as early as possible so the project has a goal of developing a commercial application as well as developing the technology for NASA use. This integration will be accomplished by selecting partners who will cooperatively share in the development of the technology for an identified commercialization purpose while simultaneously developing the technology for the specified NASA need. 1.2  Scope This solicitation is seeking responses from commercial partners interested in entering into a cooperative agreement with NASA for the joint development of a Dual Use technology project.  It is published as NASA Cooperative Agreement Notice, CAN-SSC-03-01 entitled "Dual Use Technology Development Cooperative Agreement Notice."  The Dual Use projects are sponsored and managed by the Office of Technology Transfer at the John C. Stennis Space Center, Stennis Space Center (SSC), MS 39529-6000.  Proposals should be submitted in accordance with the instructions in this CAN and should meet the project requirements identified. The projects will be selected based on the criteria described in the following sections. NASA plans to fund up to six projects at approximately $20,000 to $75,000 per project with a period of performance of approximately 12 months. Projects are contingent upon availability of funds. The participating partner will contribute resources to match the NASA funding. The projects will be joint development efforts in the areas of rocket propulsion testing and earth system science that will include collaboration with NASA or NASA support contractor personnel.  NASA facilities may be available for use in the technology development and demonstration if needed and stipulated in the agreement. NASA will award cooperative agreements under the CAN in accordance with Section D of the NASA Grant and Cooperative Agreement Handbook.	The Handbook is available on the internet at http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/nais/nasa_ref.cgi.  Under a CAN, the funding agency will have substantial involvement in, and contribution to, the technical aspects of the effort.  Cooperative Agreements differ from grant programs where there is no substantial involvement of the funding agency in monitoring the work or research program. This type of agreement allows contact with any potential technical resources at Stennis Space Center during the development of the proposal. 1.3 Partnership Principles In a cooperative agreement between NASA and a commercial firm, substantial resource contribution on the part of the Recipient is required.	The Recipient is expected to contribute at least 50 percent of the total resources required to accomplish the cooperative agreement.  Recipient contributions may be cash, non-cash or both.   Milestone billing is the method of payment to the Recipient under cooperative agreements.  Performance based milestones are used as the basis of establishing a set of verifiable milestones for payment purposes.  Each milestone payment shall be established so that the Government payment is at the same share ratio as the cooperative agreement share ratio.	The partner will establish the milestones necessary to accomplish the technology development.  These milestones will be identified in the proposal. NASA requires that the first Milestone be a project "kick-off" meeting between the partner and NASA. At a minimum, a brief status report will be required at completion of each milestone.  NASA also requires that the last Milestone be a project closeout briefing between NASA and all parties involved. The final milestone payment will not be made until all reporting requirements for the project have been submitted. 2.0  Project Requirements 2.1	   Technical Requirements The objective of Dual Use projects is to develop technologies for a commercial purpose while simultaneously meeting a NASA need.  All proposals must clearly identify the technical requirements for the NASA need at the John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC).  The main focus areas at SSC are Propulsion Testing and Earth System Science. Technical needs in the area of propulsion testing include, but are not limited to, development of wireless data acquisition systems to provide sensor measurements such as temperatures, vibrations, or vacuum pressure from remote facility locations. These measurement systems would be utilized in facility systems to monitor vacuum pressure in vacuum jacketed cryogenic piping, mechanical vibrations introduced into the facility piping systems, and other remote measurements from controlled hazard sites.  Other technical needs in the area of propulsion testing include tools that will enhance the analysis, modeling and design capabilities at Stennis in areas such as complex fluid flow systems. In addition, there is interest in a Data Acquisition and Control System (DACS) digital redline buss that can provide information to the Control System in 1 to 5 ms. Another area of interest is technologies that would improve the liner/plug arrangement in balanced trim valves. Technical needs in the area of earth sciences include, but are not limited to, development of multi-spectral image manipulators for ArcIMS to process remotely sensed for identification and enhancement of selected features such as specific soil and crop information. There is also interest in innovative techniques for portable, highly accurate instruments for the spectral absorption and real time detection and measurement of particulate materials in water samples. Another area of interest is processing methods of remotely sensed data that will extract smog/fog features from the data to provide images of the terrain below the smog/fog area. It is expected that parties interested in partnering with SSC on technology development contained in this solicitation will contact SSC to gain a better understanding of the technical requirements.  In addition to addressing the NASA need, a project in these areas must also identify the commercial market potential of the technology. 2.2 Commercialization Requirements The second objective of Dual Use projects is the commercialization of the technology.  All proposals must contain a business plan, which includes a market feasibility study of the proposed technology, an estimate of financial resources required to commercialize the technology, and the strategy to produce and market the technology. 2.3 Reporting Requirements All proposals must contain provisions for reporting the progress and results of the Dual Use project to the Office of Technology Transfer and the Technical Monitor.  The content and frequency of the reports must be identified in the proposal. At a minimum, progress must be reported at each milestone and a final report detailing the results of the project. In addition, the reporting clauses in a cooperative agreement requires that any reportable technology or innovation developed during the partnership must be reported even though the Intellectual Property of any innovation is retained by the partner. 3.0      Proposal Instructions for CAN 3.1	     Proposal Submission Three (3) copies of the proposal should be submitted to NASA. An official authorized to certify company contribution, as well as, the management and financial aspects of the proposed project must sign the proposals.  All proposals should be sent to: NASA Acquisition Management Office/Code BA31 John C. Stennis Space Center Stennis Space Center, MS 39529-6000 This office must receive proposals no later than 4:00 PM on January 31, 2003. 3.2   Proposal Content and Format All proposals shall contain the following sections: 1) Technical Proposal section detailing the technical objectives and methods to be used in the project, 2) Business/Commercialization Plan section outlining the commercialization goals and processes, 3) Personnel and Facilities section describing the relevant experience of the key personnel and the facilities to be used in the execution of the project, and 4) Cost section containing both the expected NASA cost and the contributions of the company. All proposals should contain the sections listed above and be assembled in the following order with the page limitations shown. Title Page  1 Introduction  2 Technical Proposal    4 Business/Commercialization Plan	   3 Personnel and Facilities	   2 Cost Plan	   2 Schedule	   2 Milestones	1 3.3	Technical Proposal A project proposal must present a scientific or technical innovative approach that addresses a specific NASA technology need in the areas described in Section 2.1.  The proposal should contain a clear and succinct statement of the specific technology development proposed and a brief explanation of how this innovative approach is relevant and important to meeting the identified technology need. A work plan should be included that indicates what development effort will be performed, where it will be performed, and how it will be performed. The methods planned to achieve each objective or task should be discussed in detail. These task descriptions should be linked to the milestones defined for the payment schedule. 3.4	Personnel and Facilities Plan Key personnel involved in the development activities will be identified in this section. Key personnel are the principal investigator and other individuals whose expertise and functions are essential to the success of the project. Provide biographic information including directly related education and experience.  Describe in detail any subcontracting, consultant, or other business arrangements. The offeror should identify and describe the relevant facilities and equipment currently available, and those to be purchased, to support the proposed activities. NASA strongly discourages funding the acquisition of equipment, instrumentation, or facilities. 3.5     Business/Commercialization Plan This section will describe plans for commercialization by identifying the contemplated commercial product and/or service and describe the corresponding commercial venture and the unique competitive advantage of both.  Provide a market feasibility study by identifying the target market and showing the distinction between U.S. Government and other markets with an estimated potential market size in terms of revenues to be realized by the offeror.  Show the strategic relevance of the project to the offeror with the proposed technology in terms of the offeror's current business segments, overall business plan, and relative position with respect to its competitors. Describe the amounts and sources of private financial resources expended and committed to date with respect to the technology development project and business development of the targeted commercial venture with evidence of the offeror's current financial strength. 3.6	      Cost Plan The Cost Plan should contain a budget and co-funding plan that contains clear identification of cash requirements and contributions as well as the value of in-kind resources dedicated to accomplishing the project.  Under the terms of a cooperative agreement, the offeror is required to contribute at least 50% of the total resources required to accomplish the cooperative agreement.  This contribution can be in cash, non-cash, or a combination. The budget must be sufficient and reasonable to accomplish the project.  It must identify the costs for the milestones and final deliverables. It must also contain a clear co-funding plan for the use of NASA resources.	The Cost Plan should be prepared in accordance with the following guidelines and completed for each of the agreement years. The Plan shall include the resources requested from NASA. The costs for the project and the shared funding requirements of the Cost Plan should be reflected in a Table similar to that shown in Exhibit 3.6.1. The cost categories in the table should be based on the descriptions in the following sections.

The technical capabilities and experiences of the principal investigator or project manager, key personnel, staff, consultants and subcontractors, if any, will be evaluated for consistency with the research effort and their degree of commitment and availability. The necessary facilities required must be shown to be adequate and any reliance on external sources, such as Government Furnished Equipment or Facilities, addressed. The information used to evaluate this factor is to be included in the proposal as described in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 above. 4.2   Factor: Commercialization Plan The commercialization plan will be evaluated on the strength of the commercial potential of the technology. This includes the offeror's ability to identify a specific, well-defined commercial product or service based on the technology to be developed and a realistic target market niche of sufficient size with the potential for meeting a well-defined need within the target market niche. The evaluation will also consider the capability of the offeror to bring the remaining necessary private financial, physical, personnel and other resources to bear in a timely manner to achieve commercial application of the technology. In applying these commercial criteria, NASA will assess proposal information in terms of credibility, objectivity, reasonableness of key assumptions, independent corroborating evidence, internal consistency, demonstrated awareness of key risk areas and critical business vulnerabilities, and other indicators of sound business analysis and judgment.  4.3	    Factor: Cost Realism The cost plan will be evaluated to ensure that the proposed budget is sufficient and reasonable to accomplish the project.	The evaluation will assess whether there is clear identification of cash requirements and contributions as well as the value of in-kind resources dedicated to accomplishing the project. The evaluation will ensure the plan meets the terms of the cooperative agreement that there is a contribution of at least 50% of the total resources required to accomplish the cooperative agreement whether in cash or in kind contributions.

<SUBJECT>A -- Space Control Day
<DESC>The Air Force intends to hold an Industry Day for informational purposes as it relates to the Space Control Mission Area and current work to develop a Family of Systems Architecture.  The Space Control Mission Area ensures the freedom of operations within and through the space medium, while denying its use to adversaries. As space has become an area of vital national interest, the United States must be prepared to protect and defend its space systems, including spacecraft, communications links, and ground segments.  Space Control includes three sub-missions: Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Defensive Counterspace (DCS) and Offensive Counterspace (OCS).  SSA near-term modernization and materiel solutions include developing a constellation of space-based tracking/surveillance sensors.  DCS near-term material solutions include developing a system to detect attacks on US space systems and improved processing for attack characterization. OCS near-term materiel solutions include developing ground systems for the temporary denial of space asset information to adversaries.

The first goal of this session is to inform industry about Air Force Space Command's Space Control mission area vision and requirements, the Space and Missile Systems Center's acquisition plans, and the Mission Area Prime Integration Contractor's (MAPIC) architecture work.  The meeting will focus on two of the sub-mission areas:  SSA and DCS.  In addition, special emphasis will be given to emerging programs: Rapid Attack, Identification, Detection and Reporting Systems (RAIDRS) and more limited presentations on the Counter-Communication System (CCS) and Counter-Surveillance/ Reconnaissance System (CSRS).

The second goal of this session is to serve as the Industry Day for the Space-Based Surveillance System (SBSS) system.  This part will focus on the overall acquisition strategy, near-term activities, and elements of the Statement of Objectives.  In addition, SBSS will discuss updates and status of the initial requirements.

An agenda can be found at www.aero.org/conferences.  A map can be found at http://www.aero.org/locations/elSegundo.html.

The Industry Day is planned for 19 December 2002 from 0800-1700 at the Aerospace Corporation, Building A-8, Conference Center in El Segundo, CA.  Please RSVP by 12 December 2002.  A $5 fee to cover the cost of coffee and snacks will be collected at check-in.  The briefing will take place at the Secret level. Interested companies are limited to four (4) attendees each.  Please fax clearances to SMC/AD Security, Attn: Joy DeLeo at (310) 416-1565.  In addition to sending clearances, please send names and Social Security numbers to Lt.

<SUBJECT>U -- National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Science Enrichment Program (SEP)
<DESC>This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with San Diego State University, pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This contract action will represent two (02) additional years of contract performance for the National Cancer Institute?s (NCI) Science Enrichment Program (SEP).    

NCI implemented the SEP in 1990.  The program encourages rising tenth-graders from under-represented minority and medically under-served population to pursue careers in biomedical research.  The overall goals of the program are to:  1) encourage under-represented minority and underserved students to select careers in science, mathematics and/or research, 2) broaden and enrich students? science, research, and socio-cultural backgrounds.  The major objectives through which these goals are met are executed by 1) providing opportunities for student to experience the fields of science, mathematics and laboratory research through hand-on techniques and resources that extend beyond those of the typical high school classroom 2) provide students with an ?I can-do-it? feeling regarding their abilities in the sciences and 3) Contribute to the advancement of a strong core future researchers.  

The project expanded in 1992 with the award of four competitive contracts.  The project was re-competed in 1998 with a successful award to San Diego State University.
 
As of July 2002 approximately 1,750 student had participated in the SEP experience.  Although there are no longitudinal data yet about these students? continuing interests in the sciences as a career, data are beginning to show positive increases in their levels of academic confidence and attitudes about science.  In addition to assessing the aptitudes and attitudes of current students and tracking their progress, the program?s evaluation component also includes a survey of the 1,250  students who participated in SEP prior to 1997.  

The alumni study and collection of data was temporarily halted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  June 2002 pending their approval of NCI?s revised collection plan submitted in March of this year.  The revised plan also included a request for a six-month extension to complete a final round of parent?s surveys.  OMB will provide authorization to continue only after resolution of any issues that may be raised during the lengthy approval process.  

The intent of this sole source action is to prevent a programming hiatus with the SEP while NCI receives OMB approval and subsequently completes the evaluation work necessary to make an informed, evidenced-based decision regarding the continuation of the SEP program.  The data necessary for this decision will not be completed by the time the current contracts expire.  This extension will provide contract performance through January, 2005.

This action is under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.
