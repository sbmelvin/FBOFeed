<DESC>The work involves excavation, analysis of the condition of sections of the drain, and replacement of damaged sections of toe drain pipe and filter envelope. The scope of the necessary repairs will not be identified until damaged sections can be excavated and the remainder of the drain section can be inspected. Excavation will be to depths of approximately 20 feet. Dewatering and unwatering of the excavation areas will be required. Excavation will require removal of portions of the dam embankment and stability of the excavated area will be a major concern. Failure to adequately control seepage and maintain slope stability in the excavated sections could result in failure of the dam. Failure of the dam would endanger numerous lives in populated areas downstream of the dam.

This is an invitation for all highly capable offerors to participate in this conference on 5 Nov 2002. Industry day will be held at 1038 South Patrick Drive, Hanger 985, PAFB, FL 32925.

Potential offerors should monitor the official Government Point of Entry (GPE) website (www.fedbizopps.gov).  It is the intent of the Government to also establish a technical library at https://state.monmouth.army.mil/ under contract number S-OPRAQ-98-C-0051, it is the responsibility of all potential offerors to subscribe to these websites for all future notifications and information. These sites will provide information regarding the Industry Day agenda and attendee instructions. Register by e-mailing Steve Harris, harriss@inlfl.state.gov with the individuals name (s), email address (es), company and phone number of attendees no later than 14 October 2002. This information is critical in our planning of Industry day. Questions or specific items of interest you would like to see addressed can be mailed to harriss@inlfl.state.gov. Industry day participation is strictly voluntary and the Government will not provide any reimbursement to those contractors who attend this day.
The acquisition will be based on best value procurement; the resulting contract will be issued as a performance-based, incentive type, hybrid contract having an approximate value of $150M per annum and the total length of performance that may exceed 5 years. It is anticipated that the government will release a draft statement of objectives and RFP for industry input.
This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. Firms should not construe this synopsis as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. An acquisition Ombudsman, Colleen Kosar , has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development. You should contact the Ombudsman with only those issues or problems that you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the Program Managers and/or Contracting Officer. The Ombudsman?s role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and to communicate these to the appropriate government personnel. The ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired. The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection. You may contact the Acquisition Ombudsman at email: KosarCM@state.gov.
 Please direct any program questions to Steven Harris any contracting issues should be directed to Vincent Chaverini, Jr at ChaveriniVJ@state.gov.
