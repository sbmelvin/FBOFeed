<DESC>The Olympic National Forest, Washington, intends to acquire by contract the conversion from a gravity fed water system to a pressurized tank water system at the Seal Rock Campground.  Project includes: removal of  the existing redwood water tank; replacement of the well pump; replacement of the roof and insulation of the well house; installation of 310 feet of secondary power and telephone cable underground from electrical service to pump house; electrical work; and installation of a storage shed.     

The government will proceed to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) Solicitation  with a cascading set-aside.  Award will be made to a HubZone small business concern, provided there is adequate competition among such firms.  If there is inadequate competition from HUBZone small business concerns, award will be made to a small business concern.  The Seal Rock Campground is open to the public from May 26th to Sept. 2nd.  The RFP has two alternative performance periods.  Offers may be submitted for either, or both, options.  Option 1, the contract performance period is from April 01, 2008, to Oct. 31, 2008.  Between April 01st and April 31st, Offeror shall: install the pressurized water tanks; cap the water lines from old water tank; and install a pressure switch in the control panel, so the water system is fully functional.  The remaining tasks shall be completed by Oct. 31, 2008.  From May 01, 2008, to Sept. 02, 2008, the water system can only be shutdown from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m daily.  Option 2, the contract performance period is from SEPT. 02, 2008, to OCT. 31, 2008.    The government estimated value is between $100,000.00 and  $250,000.00.  Offerors will be evaluated on: price; experience; past performance; key personnel and subcontractors; proposed equipment; price realism; and Level of Confidence Assessment Rating (LOCAR).  Contract award will be to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the best value to the government.  

Davis Bacon Act wage rates apply.  The proposed contract-type is firm-fixed price.  This solicitation will be available on, or about, FEB. 15, 2008.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is  237110 and the annual size standard is $31,000,000.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government.  In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//.  For additional information contact Mr. Miley Sutherland, Contract Specialist, at 360-956-2471.  The technical contact for this project is Ms. Jessica Baca, Engineer, 360-956-2317.

An Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) Option, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Option, Re-Procurement Package Option, and various Full Rate Production (FRP) Options will also be included in each contract.  In the event of a multiple award, the above Options will be exercised with a single SDD contractor after a downselect process.  Best Estimated Quantities (BEQs) are provided for the following:  IOT&E Articles (180 ea), LRIP Units (260 ea), FRP MACH Units (24,000 ea), FRP AH-64 Module Interfaces (500 ea), FRP JHMCS Module Interfaces (600 ea) and FRP Maxillofacial Shields (4,000 ea).  Requirements will be provided in a Government Performance Specification, Statement of Objectives (SOO), Contractor Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs), and final solicitation.  The application of Full Tradeoff source selection procedures will be utilized pursuant to AFFARS 5315.3 in the best value determination.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Tharp, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2092
<DESC>NAICS Code: 611310   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Colorado State University (CSU) for Analysis of the Soil Carbon Stock Change and Soil N20 Emission Estimates associated with Biofuel Production.  CSU will be tasked with simulating land use conversions from grassland and forestland, as well as changes in existing cropping rotations that are needed to meet the biofuel market demand.  Specifically, CSU will be tasked with providing several key analyses of land use and cropping trends and Greenhouse Gas (GHG)  emissions associated with independent agricultural sector analysis provided by EPA.  CSU researchers are uniquely qualified for this effort due to their extensive expertise in utilizing the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology for estimating soil carbon stocks in the U.S.  and remains the only entity which has successfully applied the IPCC methodology to the existing U.S. activity data for generation of national soil carbon estimates.  EPA has utilized the soil carbon estimates generated by CSU over the last eight years in the annual publication of the U.S. Inventory  of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.  The Century/Daycent models, which will be used for the foreseeable future to estimate soil carbon and nitrous oxide flux from soils, were developed by CSU researchers.  CSU researchers have recently run these models, and the soil carbon and soil nitrous oxide  estimates generated from the models were utilized in the 1990 - 2005 U.S. Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.  CSU researchers have been working for over seven years to develop the methodology and associated documentation for the soil carbon estimates and for two years on the soil  nitrous oxide estimates used in the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory.  The soil carbon chapter of the recently completed 2006 IPCC Guidelines, amongst many other IPCC publications which are used as the methodological basis for developing the greenhouse gas estimates in national inventories including  the U.S. were authored or co-authored by CSU Researchers.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing analysis of the soil carbon stock change and soil N20 emission estimates associated with biofuel production may  submit appropriate documentation within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be  considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Optical Technology Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Newport Corporation, of Irvine, CA for a stepper driven linear stage UTS100ppV6 and EPS300 2-axis motion control system.

Sole source determination is based on the following: This equipment must be 100% plug-in compatible and interchangeable with NIST?s existing Newport Corporation UTM50CC1DD translation stages and must provide instrument control instructions compatible with the existing Newport MM3000 motion controller. The Newport Corporation stepper driven linear stage UTS100ppV6 and EPS300 2-axis motion controller is the only translation stage system that is software and hardware compatible with the existing NIST custom made high speed transient thermal imaging (HSTTI) system. The NIST HSTTI system uses computer controlled translation stages to position a high speed transient thermal detector during a sample measurement sequence using instrument instructions imbedded in the HSTTI instrument control and user interface software. The new 2-axis motion control system will be used to transition the NIST HSTTI system to a recently upgraded detector system. Newport Corporation is sole manufacturer and distributor of this equipment.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by February 1, 2008, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the water distribution (NAICS 221310) and wastewater collection systems (NAICS 221320) at Fort Meade, Maryland.  Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. ?2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the water distribution and wastewater collection systems at Fort Meade, MD, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the systems and provide utility services to the Government.  Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter .Notice.) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm on Thursday, February 14, 2008.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Governments use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March-April 2008 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

<DESC>This is a notice of the Government's intent to award/ negotiate on a sole source basis with Energy Systems Group for maintenance and repair services of the government-owned commercial laundry operations located in Bldg. 205, at the James H. Quillen VA Medical Center, in Mountain Home, TN (VAMC).   An extensive list of specialized contractor furnished tools is required for contract performance in accordance with the solicitation terms and conditions.  The VAMC Mountain Home laundry operations are used to perform laundry services for Asheville and Salisbury, North Carolina VAMCs, as well as Mountain Home.  The safe and efficient twenty-four (24) hour operation of facility equipment is critical for the VA's patients and medical community.  All services will be performed on the commercial laundry equipment located on-site at the James H. Quillen VA Medical Center, Building 205, Mountain Home, TN.   Energy Systems Group provides steam and chilled water for VAMC Mountain Home through a lease arrangement with the VA corporate office and has provided laundry facility maintenance and repair services in the past. A determination by the Government to procure these services sole source is based in part upon industry's response to the sources sought advertisement for this requirement which posted FedBizOpps on 14 December 2007.  Further, determination by the Government is also based on the fact that award to any other source would likely result in substantial duplication of costs to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement.   Written responses to this synopsis must contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement.  This notice is neither a Request for Proposal nor a request for competition; however request for copies of the solicitation can be emailed to sherita.crosby@va.gov .   See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Christina Nigro, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3125
<DESC>The US Army, Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Command (JM&L LCMC),  Picatinny, NJ, anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the production of the Shock Attenuating Lifting Plugs for the 155mm, High Explosive  (HE), M795 Projectiles.  The RFP will be for one production year with options for an additional four production years, totaling production possibilities of  up to five years.  The 155mm, HE, M795 Projectiles is comprised of three  components: the Metal Parts, the Wooden Pallets, and the Lifting Plugs. The  Shock Attenuating Lifting Plug is installed for transportation and handling  purposes in the 155mm, HE, M795.  Before firing, the plug is removed and a  detonating fuse is installed in the nose of the projectile.  The lifting plug  acts as a shock absorber in the critical nose area of the projectile where high  stress may occur.  The plug has the design capability of bending under low  stresses and breaking if the stresses become too high.  Under high stress, the  lifting plug will shear in a way that will prevent the fuse from being  installed.  The Shock Attenuating Lifting Plug renders the projectile safe and  unusable if it is inadvertently subjected to a drop on its nose that exceeds  design limits.  The Lifting Plugs are to be made from malleable iron casting  (i.e. ASTM A47 or ASTM A602), with a 2.000-12 UNS thread, a flange diameter of  approximately 3.80 inches and an outer loop diameter of approximately 1.80  inches.  It is anticipated that there will be delivery requirements of up to  150,000 Plugs during the base year (12,500 Plugs per month), with potential  option quantities of up to an additional 400,000 Lifting Plugs over the four  option years.  This includes machining equipment, metal finishing facilities,  and packaging equipment.  This production volume will also necessitate the use  of dedicated gaging equipment.  The Request for Proposal which will address a  requirement to produce these Shock Attenuating Lifting Plugs, will be posted on  or about 14 December 2007.  The point of contact for this requirement is  Christina Nigro, AMSML-AQ-AC, Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. Email:  Christina.Nigro@us.army.mil. Numbered Notes 1 and 8 apply to this acquisition.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners to support Consular posts overseas.  The choice to use the D230 as opposed to other barcode readers available is that this unit is a drop-in replacement to the barcode scanners previously used (Gryphon D200 and D220 barcode scanners that have recently reached end-of-life).   The continued use of Datalogic scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  In addition, the barcode scanners require customized software.  Because the D230 model is similar to the models previously used, no changes will be required for the customized software due to driver incompatibilities.  The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanner meets the following requirements: 	The scanner works with both NIV (Non-Immigrant Visa) and IVO (Immigrant Visa Overseas) applications.  	The scanner reads both one-dimensional (linear) and two-dimensional (stacked) barcodes. 	The scanner must use and draw its power from the USB 2.0 interface. This will remove the need to purchase 110-volt and 220-volt power supplies. 	The scanner provides full compatibility with every application that exploits the USB interface: USB KBD (keyboard) Wedge, USB COM (communication) emulation and USB IBM POS (point of sale). In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners without delay.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. CA/CST has selected the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners because results obtain by the Bureaus System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoSs processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>AnneMarie Ternay, (609) 485-6990
<DESC>In accordance with Acquisition Management System Toolbox (AMS) T3.2.1.2, the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) is conducting a market survey to assist in its development of an appropriate procurement strategy in fulfilling the Service Operations Support (SOS) requirements.  The SOS procurements will provide second-level engineering and field restoration services to the Terminal, EnRoute, and Technical Operations organizations. The following documents are attached to this announcement:   1. "Draft" statement of work (SOW) dated 12/20/07 2. "Draft" high-level listing of personnel required dated 12/20/07 3. "Draft" listing of systems that will be supported dated 12/20/07 4.  Business Declaration This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  A down-selection will not be conducted as a result of the market survey.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing the services described in the attached SOW. Currently, the WJHTC has two professional support service contracts that provide second-level engineering and field restoration services support.  The first was awarded as a competitive Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB) - 8(a), time and materials (T&M) procurement to Client Network Services, Incorporated (CNSI) under DTFA03-02-D-00011 (SOS-5) for legacy system support with a maximum ordering limitation of 2,883,013 hours (estimated value at $178.4M) for a base of one year with six 1-year option periods.  The other contract was a competitive Small Business Set-Aside, T&M procurement awarded to Apptis, Incorporated (previously known as Technology and Management Associates, Incorporated (TMA)) as DTFA03-02-D-00015 (SOS-6) for new system support with a maximum ordering limitation of 3,845,983 hours (estimated value at $248.4M) for a base of one year with six 1-year option periods. The WJHTC desires to provide an opportunity to compete at least a SEDB - 8(a) and a small business competition for the follow-on requirements under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519 (Other Computer Related Services) with a size standard of $23M. Currently, the Government has not yet determined which systems (attachment no. 3) will be included in the SEDB - 8(a) or small business competition.  The Government contemplates an award of at least two T&M type or cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) type contracts to fulfill the requirements of the attached "draft" SOW.  The period of performance is anticipated for seven (7) years.  The commencement date is expected around March 2009.     At this time, interested sources are requested to provide the extent and depth of their PRIME experience (as either a prime or a subcontractor) in performing the same or similar maintenance support as described in the attached draft SOW.   No more than five (5) pages shall be submitted.  An elaborate proposal is not required.  The submission should be simple and provide straightforward, concise delineation of the respondent's prime experience in performing the same or similar work as described in the attached SOW. In addition to the 5-page technical capabilities submission, interested firms are also asked to submit the attached Business Declaration form (attachment no. 4) and a copy of their 8(a) certification (if applicable).  Also, submissions must also identify whether or not the contractor has been recently audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and whether or not the contractor has a DCAA approved Cost Accounting System.  IF THE VENDOR HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED AND/OR DOES NOT HAVE AN APPROVED DCAA COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM, PLEASE IDENTIFY IF YOU PLAN TO ATTAIN EITHER, AND WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR RECEIVING THEM.  LACK OF AN APPROVED DCAA COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED WHEN DETERMINING ADEQUATELY QUALIFIED FIRMS. Failure of a sufficient number of adequately qualified firms that respond to this survey may result in a competitive procurement open to all businesses, so all qualified SEDB 8(a) and small businesses are highly encouraged to respond to this survey. Responses to this announcement are due by 2 p.m. (local time) on JANUARY 30, 2008, and shall be directed to the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Attn:  Anne Marie Ternay, AJP-7951, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ  08405.  An original and 4 COPIES, and one electronic copy on CD is required.  The electronic submission and the hard copies must be identical.  E-mail responses WILL NOT be accepted.  Any comments, concerns, or questions regarding this procurement are highly encouraged and may be directly submitted to Anne Marie Ternay.  These comments, concerns, or questions do not have a page limitation and are in addition to the 5-page technical capabilities statement submission.  The Government reserves its right to consider any, all, or none of the comments, concerns or questions received. All interested parties are advised the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission.

<DESC>The 77th Aeronautical Systems Group (77 AESG), Aircrew Performance Division (TA), seeks input from industry on the Modular Aircrew Common Helmet (MACH) Draft Request for Proposals (RFP). The objective of the MACH program is to provide a single helmet system capable of meeting all rotary and fixed wing mission requirements.  The joint forces require the ability to easily and rapidly transition between required capabilities (e.g. symbology displays, cueing, and night vision) or use these devices simultaneously for optimum capability. The MACH will provide a common, modular solution to permit units to tailor helmet capabilities to suit mission requirements. The Draft RFP and associated documents are attached separately from this notice. Interested vendors must have an account with FedTeDS to access the Draft Performance Specification. This account can be set up at https://www.fedteds.gov. Comments to the Draft RFP are due no later than 4:00pm CDT on 09 July 2007.

<DESC>THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL HSFEHQ-08R-0022 HAS BEEN AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:  
1.  EXTENDS THE DATE PROPOSALS ARE DUE FROM 1/25/08 TO 1/28/08, 2 PM, EST.
2.  MODIFIES THE RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS FROM ALL QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS OPERATING WITHIN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA TO ALL QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS OPERATING WITHIN OTTAWA COUNTY.
3.  PROVIDING ANSWERS THAT WERE FURNISHED DURING THE SITE VISIT OF JANUARY 11, 2008 AND QUESTIONS QUERIED BY INTERESTED CONTRACTORS UP TO JANUARY 15, 2008.  THE ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED AS FOLLOWS:

QUESTIONS FROM CONTRACTORS

1.  I would like to use the format/forms that the contract office places on the solicitation so I can send them back electronically.  This one is in an adobe format and it?s protected.  Is there a way you can send it to me in a word or tell me how to unprotect this document?  Indeed the Form 1449 is protected.  Please print it out and sign Block 30b and date Block 30c.  You can then scan and send this to me via email at Linda.S.Jackson1@dhs.gov or via fax at (202) 646-1765.  

2.  You said that the solicitation was limited only to firms residing or doing business within Ottawa County.  Is this correct or will that requirement change?  The rationale for limiting the area is FAR 26.202(a)(2), which states:  The designated area need not include all the counties in the declared disaster/emergency area(s), but cannot go outside it.  Since the disaster declaration was limited to specific counties, the solicitation must also be limited to specific counties.

3.  Preventive monthly, is it done monthly on every unit?  Yes.  It is part of the monthly maintenance.

4.  For the monthly maintenance, what happens if the person is not there?   FEMA?s policy is to do an outside inspection.  Please notify FEMA and DHOPS if the applicant does not respond after the third time visit.  Appropriate action will then be taken at that time.  

5.  If the questions are going to be in writing, are you going to post them in writing as well?   Correct, they will be posted on the 18th.  

6.  Can we have a list of the sign-in sheet?   The contractor attendance sheet is attached.  

7.  When are proposals due?  This requirement has been extended to January 28, 2008.  

8.  The solicitation states it is exclusively for companies residing or operating within the state of Oklahoma (OK).  I represent a SDVOB, non-based company with significant experience with MH/TT maintenance and deactivation and we have identified several OK companies willing to enter a Joint Venture (JV) under 13 CFR 125.15 with us.  My questions are as follows:

a.  Can we enter into a JV pursuant with an OK concern and submit a viable proposal on the solicitation although we, a SDVOB, are not an OK based company?
The answer is yes however the OK company must primarily operate within the County of Ottowa (see explanation # 2).  
b.  Is there a document we have to submit to you as evidence of a JV under 13 CFR 125.15?  Please see FAR 19.1403  Status as a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern is as follows:
(a) Status as a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern is determined in accordance with 13 CFR Parts 125.8 through 125.13; also see 19.307. 
(b) At the time that a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern submits its offer, it must represent to the contracting officer that it is a? 
(1) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern; and 
(2) Small business concern under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the procurement. 
(c) A joint venture may be considered a service-disabled veteran owned small business concern if? 
(1) At least one member of the joint venture is a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern, and makes the representations in paragraph (b) of this section; 
(2) Each other concern is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the procurement; 
(3) The joint venture meets the requirements of paragraph 7 of the explanation of Affiliates in 19.101; and 
(4) The joint venture meets the requirements of 13 CFR 125.15(b). 
       (d) Any service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern (nonmanufacturer) must meet the requirements in 19.102(f) to receive a benefit under this program.

9.  Can this solicitation be sole sourced?  This is a competitive total set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses only.  This requirement will not be sole sourced.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH - This notice is being published to determine the availability of small businesses that are interested, fully qualified and available during the Mandatory Availability Period (MAP) to perform the work outlined above.

The Forest Service intends to solicit proposals for exclusive use flight services, fully contractor operated and maintained, under the direction and control of the Forest Service (see pre-solicitation notice AG-0109-S-08-0005).  The need consists of one Type III, single engine, 4-7 passenger, pop-out float equipped helicopter.  The Forest Service anticipates locating the base in Juneau, Alaska.  Temporary alternate bases throughout Southeast and South-central Alaska may be assigned.  The mandatory availability period of performance for the base period is June 15 through September 15, 2008.

The helicopter will be used to support maintenance of mountain-top radio repeater sites on the Tongass and Chugach National Forests in Southeast and South-central Alaska.  The typical repeater site would require a pinnacle approach to a peak as high as 5,500 feet MSL.  It may also be used occasionally for the administration and protection of Public Lands.  During the Mandatory Availability Period and any extensions thereof, the aircraft will be made available for the exclusive use of the Government.  The Contractor will be required to be certificated under 14 CFR, Parts 133, 137 and 135, Air Taxi Operators & Commercial Operators for the category and class of helicopter required under the contract.  The term of the contract will be one year with options to renew for two additional years.  Due to the mobile nature of this mission, the contractor shall be prepared to purchase fuel from commercial aviation fuel vendors through-out Southeast and South-Central Alaska.

Qualified small businesses that intend to participate in this acquisition are asked provide relative information that they meet or exceed the above requirements - including availability during the MAP - to the following e-mail address, no later than January 18, 2008 at 4:00 p.m. AST:

Mari Meiners
Contract Specialist
mmeiners@fs.fed.us

In addition, interested parties are requested to provide daily availability and hourly rate cost estimates for the base period of June - September, 2008.     

The submission of information and/or cost estimates does not obligate the Government to purchase, or the interested parties to furnish any helicopters, as the market research and the cost estimates are for planning purposes only.

<DESC>The Navstar GPS Block III Space Vehicle Program (GPS III) intends to award a sole source Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract modification to Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems & Solutions contract FA8807-04-C-0001 for a period of 01 November 2007 to award of GPS III Satellite Production contract.  Lockheed Martin can provide the following supplies without the Government incurring substantial duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (10 USC 2304(c)(1)).  GPS Constellation sustainment is driving the need for GPS IIIA Key Decision Point-B (KDP-B).  The delay of KDP-B from August to December 2007 provided an opportunity for further system design risk reduction activities to be performed.  Lockheed Martin is currently on contract and has completed a delta Systems Requirements Review (SRR) in November of 2006 and System Design Review (SDR) in March of 2007.  This action will add approximately five months to the existing GPS III Phase A contract and will build upon Lockheed Martins current GPS III Space Vehicle Risk Reduction and System Definition effort scheduled to conclude November 2007.  

Under the contemplated contract action, Lockheed will provide demonstration of lower-level design maturity and analysis of critical technologies and engineering integration processes to ensure time-certain development.  Lockheed Martin will also provide key updates to the SDR baseline to ensure functional and performance allocations are complete and traceable from space system level to sub-system level.  This includes functional and performance requirements flowdown to incorporate evolving requirements as identified in the July 2007 Joint Requirements Oversight Council GPS III Capability Development Document.  Other key products include a mature space system design and navigation payload sub-system design consistent with the contractor's prime item specification and SMC military specifications and standards.  Furthermore, Lockheed Martin will provide necessary Life Cycle Cost Estimates (LCCE) updates consistent with a high confidence, low risk capability insertion program plan for a FY2014 launch availability and additional LCCE for an accelerated launch availability before FY2014; and mature contractor GPS definition and design products to support on-going Independent Program Assessment and Independent Cost Assessment for the December 2007 KDP-B.

Interested contractors are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) addressing the ability to satisfy the above requirements to GPSW/PK, Attn: Kelly Britton, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.

<DESC>ADVERTISEMENT FOR PREQUALIFICATION
Subject to conditions prescribed by the University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, responses to the University's prequalification documents for a Lump Sum construction Subcontract are sought for the following project:
DEMOLITION OF BUILDING 51 AND BEVATRON
PREQUALIFICATION CRITERIA
SOLICITATION NUMBER 932

To be performed at 
Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 
One Cyclotron Road
Berkeley, CA 94720
Prequalification of Prospective Bidders:	The University has determined that bidders who submit bids on this project must be prequalified. 
Prequalified bidders will be required to have a valid California contractor's licenses appropriate for the type of work involved.
General Description of Work:  Provide all labor, material, tools and equipment to complete all work as described in the plans and specifications.  The scope of work includes:
	
Base Work 
This project includes the demolition, deactivation and disposal of Building 51 and Building 51A including all tunnels, shallow foundations including shield blocks and the Bevatron accelerator housed within the building. The spatial extent of the project covers surface and subsurface materials out to the building footprint.

Building 51 is a 126,527 GSF steel-frame structure, built in the early 1950s, with a wood roof and Transite (an asbestos-containing material) exterior siding. All occupants will be vacated from this building prior to a notice to proceed for this work. Building 51 houses the Bevatron accelerator that is approximately 180 feet in diameter and consists of approximately 12,000 tons of steel and other metals. Approximately 13,500 tons of concrete shielding blocks currently encircle the accelerator. The Bevatron, a large weak-focusing synchrotron accelerator, began operation in 1954, and was last operated in 1993. 
Residual induced radioactivity is present from activation products in materials exposed to subatomic particle beams and radiation scatter. As a result of this activation, the Bevatron and surrounding structural materials contain low levels of radioactive materials. Other known hazardous materials include lead (e.g., paint, dust, brick, caulk), asbestos, silica, beryllium, PCB, volative organic compounds, and mercury.
The physical scope of the project would include: removal of the Bevatron; demolition of Buildings 51 and 51A, including their foundations; removal and disposition, including transportation of shield blocks, equipment, demolition debris, etc.; relocation of existing utilities; and site stabilization. It is envisioned that the final state of the site would be cleared and made land suitable for new construction.

Estimated Price Range and Construction Period:  The estimated value of the project is between $28M and $35M.  The project will be incrementally funded and require the selected subcontractor to manage budgets within the funded amount. The planned project completion time is approximately 42 months.

<SUBJECT>J--Maintenance Repair Services for Government Owned Hirsch Alarm System.
<SOLNBR>08CR11-NoSolicitation
<RESPDATE>013108
<ARCHDATE>01162009
<CONTACT>LISA D. HAYES PURCHASING AGENT 3032369327     Lisa D Hayes/ORS/USGS/DOI@USGS;
<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Beacon Communications LLC, 4242 Delaware St., Denver, CO  80231-3230 to provide maintenance repair services for Government owned Hirsch Alarm System. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition: 1. Contracting Agency and Activity.  The Department of the Interior, United States Geological Survey (USGS) plans to contract by means other than full and open competition as allowed under the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. 2.  Nature of Action Being Approved.  This request is for approval to contract for   services and hardware relating to upgrading the current Hirsch Electronics alarm system.   3. Description of Supplies and Services.  The Hirsch Alarm system is the first defense supporting the security requirements for the Special Applications Facility (SAF) located in Building 810 on the Denver Federal Center (DFC).  Due to restructuring, aging sensors, and support to other agencies, the alarm system requires modification to meet the national security requirements of the SAF. 4. Rationale Supporting Use of Citation in No. 5 Above.  The USGS provides the capabilities for exploitation of unclassified and classified data in support of various federal agency programs.  This support of USGS and other agency activities is coordinated through the Geography Program.  The SAF is a facility designed to meet all applications within the National Civil Applications Program (NCAP).  Because of the regimented data protection requirements, this security system has been identified to be able to meet all policy and DCID requirements.  Hirsch Electronics works through specific contractors located in specific geographic areas.  In the Denver area, Beacon is the local company.  Beacon did the initial/original installation of the Hirsch system and has since been the primary Hirsch representative to upgrade and repair the Hirsch system to its present state.  Beacon understands the configuration of the system and will be able to efficiently modify and install changes meeting our security requirements during the effort.   There are no other available entities to perform this requirement. 5. Other Sources Considered.  Other sources are not considered due to the specific operation of the system and its connectivity to the campus DHS FPS interface.   6. Future Plans to Permit Competition.  The USGS utilizes competition whenever applicable.  However, the security requirements to protect data in an unclassified or classified environment, presents obstacles to competition that are unavoidable in this instance.  Firms that believe they can provide the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Purchasing Agent.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS). Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 334290 which is 750 Employees.

<DESC>Notice:
This requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.
Background:
The Department of the Air Force has developed an Energy Strategic Plan that extends well beyond meeting the goals of both Executive Order 13423 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  The Air Force?s Vision is for energy to be a consideration in all aspects of its mission.  An important extension of the Energy Strategic Plan is expanding and diversifying the energy production and supplies portfolio.  Members of Congress have requested that the Air Force consider the merits of nuclear power production at some of its installations in order to mitigate the impact of decreased availability and rising costs of any one energy source, and because production of nuclear power produces no emissions of greenhouse gasses. 
 
Expression of Interest Desired:
The Department of the Air Force requests an expression of interest from prospective entities (developers, contractors, teams, consortiums, joint ventures, etc.) that are capable of developing, designing, providing, owning and operating a nuclear power plant that produces electricity at any possible Air Force installation across the United States.  Numerous scenarios are possible, but the Air Force anticipates under a public-private partnership that in exchange for a long-term lease of federally owned land for the nuclear power plant, it could receive reliable power for Air Force and possibly other DoD missions under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).  Other considerations would include selling excess power to the electric grid, selling/providing steam to local communities, or being a source of high temperature steam for industrial processes such as synthetic fuels and petrochemical plants. The Department of the Air Force expects all expressions of interest to be commercially funded and financially viable ventures with normal commercial risk.  In all cases, the Department of the Air Force would not develop, design, own, operate, or be the licensee for the nuclear power plant.
In addition to understanding industry interest, the Department of the Air Force is keenly interested in gaining an appreciation of the risks and challenges both the private entity as well as the Air Force may face in bringing a nuclear power plant to fruition on leased Air Force land.  No particular Air Force installation is envisioned in this Request for Information.

Submission Requirements:
Please include in your response to this Request for Information, the scenario or scenarios that would most interest your entity under a public/private partnership, and how the scenario(s) might be envisioned to operate in terms of finance, security, power guarantees, cost per KWH under a PPA, and acreages (including setback) needed.  It would be helpful to have a description of the nuclear power plant envisioned (designer, provider, source, plant life-cycle, its output, and its waste stream) and where this plant (or package plant) may have been put into operation, domestically or internationally.  Also describe as clearly and concisely as possible the issues, concerns, and challenges facing your entity as you see it, in bringing a nuclear power plant to fruition; and identify that which you believe you need in the way of commitments, guarantees, etc., or require from the Department of the Air Force to provide, own and operate a nuclear power plant on any Air Force installation in the United States.  Also of interest would be an estimate of the cost and an assessment of the time to put such a plant in place.  Although not required, if you have one or more Air Force installations in mind as you respond to this Request for Information, please identify them.  It would be helpful to also note in your response why you used this installation in developing your response.
 
Handling and Processing:
All responses received will be considered.  Under this Request for Information or under future issuances, the Department of the Air Force may continue to pursue this topic leading to the signing of a Letter of Intent with a single entity.  At our discretion, the Department of the Air Force may use competition to pursue any leases, agreements, etc., that may be issued in pursuit of the Air Force energy goals.  The Department of the Air Force expects to use consultants to assist it with its review of all responses received.  All responses received maybe held for an extended period of time or destroyed.  In no case will any responses received be returned to the originator.
Other ? Nuclear Power Session at USAF Energy Forum II
The Department of the Air Force will hold an extended session on nuclear power in conjunction with the USAF Energy Forum II on March 3, 2008 to discuss this initiative.  More information on the USAF Energy Forum II will be posted and link a will be provide on the USAF website.

Hathaway), 9324 Virginia Avenue,  Norfolk, VA 23511-3689.  Responses must be received no later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on 28 January 2008.  Electronic submission will not be accepted.  Questions regarding this sources sought notice may be addressed to Michele Hathaway at the above address, via email at Michele.Hathaway@navy.mil, or via phone at 757-322-4453. 2.0	Proposed ADS Upgrade The proposed upgrade at the Lamberts Point Deperming Station includes three primary phases: existing sensor array removal, new sensor array installation, and the installation of a series of underwater solenoids, or coils. 2.1	Sensor Array Removal As part of the proposed action, both the deep and medium depth sensor arrays were to be removed, initially.  Upon review of the recent bathymetric survey conducted around the facility, it became apparent that all the sensor tube tops were overlaid by layers of sediment ranging in thickness between 7 feet and 18 feet.  This would require divers to water-jet holes as much as 18 feet deep to gain access to any particular magnetometer tube for removing the sensor.  The NFESC ECDET submitted a recommendation to NSWCCD, NAVSEA, and MSF Norfolk to abandon in-place all medium depth sensors and cables, and remove only the deep array sensors and cables.  This recommendation had three justifications; 1) the medium depth sensor tubes are not scheduled for reuse in the future, 2) future maintenance dredging of Slip A is not planned to excavate deeper than -50 feet MLLW, and 3) attempts to remove the medium depth array would create unacceptable delays and increased costs to subsequent pro!  ject actions.   Once the sensor removal is complete, the divers will disconnect the sensor cables and will work with a crane barge to pull the remaining sensor cables out of the water for later disposal.  2.2	New Sensor Array Installation 2.2.1	Sensor Tubes A total of 291 new medium and deep sensors will be installed within Slip ?A?.  The new magnetometers will be housed inside FRP support tubes at depths of -64 feet MLLW and -85 feet MLLW, respectively.  Currently there are 106 existing sensor tubes that will be reused for the new array; 41 medium depth tubes, and 65 deep tubes.  To fill out the remainder of the array, 98 new sensor tubes will need to be installed.  In addition, 87 sensor tubes, both new and existing, will house both a medium-depth and a deep magnetometer.   The medium and deep FRP tubes will be 20 feet and 40 feet in length, respectively.  The new tubes will be pushed or water-jetted into the riverbed.  During water jetting, high-pressure water is forced through a jetting pipe as the tube casing is lowered, liquefying the bottom material. Jetting stops once the project depth is reached.  Divers are used to disconnect the jetting pipe from the FRP tube and to install temporary caps on each tube to prevent sediment intrusion. All sensor tubes are required to be installed within ?12 inches of their planned horizontal location, with tube top elevations installed within ?6 inches of the planned elevation, and a sensor tube verticality of ?3 degrees.  2.2.2	Sensor and Sensor Cable Installation A magnetometer, or sensor, assembly will consist of a single, triaxial magnetometer and cable, a carriage device called a magnetic orientation insert (MOI) which is installed inside the sensor tube and provides a means to stabilize and align the sensor to magnetic north, a sensor tube cap (part of the MOI) capable of rotating, and a sensor tube identification tag.    An exception to the assembly make-up will be the 87 sensor tubes that house both a medium and deep array sensor.  For these tubes, the MOI will be configured to house two magnetometers, one at -64 feet MLLW and one at -85 feet MLLW. After each sensor is installed in its appropriate tube, the corresponding cable will be routed along specific cable paths to, and up through, designated cable risers that will be attached to piles on Pier ?B?.  Each sensor location will be identified with a brass ID tag attached to a lifting eye on the sensor tube cap. Magnetometers and their associated cables will be GFE.   2.2.3	Sensor Junction Boxes >From the risers, each sensor cable will be routed to dedicated junction boxes mounted along the west edge of Pier ?B?.  Sensor junction boxes will be supported on aluminum frames to be fabricated and installed as part of this phase.  Each junction box will be designed to accommodate ten sensor cables that will transition to a single interconnection cable. Interconnection cables will be routed from their respective junction boxes, along a series of fiberglass and aluminum cables trays that will be mounted to the west side of Pier ?B? as part of this project, through cable trays that will be mounted beneath Pier ?E? as part of Special Project RM272-02, and ultimately into a first-floor room of the new deperming control building.  The current plan is to terminate all sensor and interconnection cables using civilian and active duty Navy personnel. Sensor junction boxes and interconnection cables will be GFE. 2.3	Y and Z Coils, or Loops This project requires the installation of two main cable loops, designated as the Y-Coil and Z-Coil.  Figure.  As shown, the Y-Coil will be configured into four rectangular coils, identified as Y1 through Y4.  Each coil will be approximately 2,000 feet in horizontal length aligned in the north-south direction.  The Z-Coil will be configured in a single rectangular coil approximately 5,360 feet in length.  The purpose of the cable coils is to generate magnetic fields using direct current.  These generated magnetic fields allow for an accurate measurement of a ship?s total magnetism and allow calibration of the new on-board advanced degaussing systems for worldwide operation. The installation tolerance for all loop cables is within ?12 inches of their planned horizontal locations.   2.3.1	Z-Coil, or Z-Loop The Z-Loop will consist of six turns of 500MCM cable, laid in a shallow dredged trench and backfilled with non-magnetic gravel for a measure of protection against fishing hooks and anchor drags.  After the cable trench is dredged, alignment piles will be driven at set intervals and at the corners where the Z-Coil makes turns.  .  Each Z-Loop turn will be installed in two segments, terminating in junction boxes mounted atop concrete-pile supported platforms.  As three of the four junction box platforms will be constructed outside the ?magnetic free zone? around the facility, standard construction materials will be employed in the fabrication and installation of these platforms.  The exception is the junction box and corresponding platform at the north end of Pier A.  Since this is within the ?magnetic free zone?, non-magnetic materials for the junction box enclosure and platform are required. Approximately 200 feet of Z-Loop cable path, around the northeast corner of the loop, will protrude into the Norfolk Harbor Federal Navigation Channel.  The channel?s current operating depth is -45 feet MLLW.  Maintenance dredging allows for an over-dredge depth of -48 feet MLLW.  In order to protect the Z-Loop cable and eliminate obstructions to future maintenance dredging of the channel, the Army Corp of Engineers, Norfolk District, has recommended the trench in this area to be dredged to a depth of -55 feet MLLW. Power to the Z-Loop will be provided by a single twisted-pair of 500MCM cables routed from the west side of the new deperming control building to one of the junction box platforms, utilizing the shallow dredged trench. 2.3.2	Y-Coil, or Y-Loop As written is paragraph 2.3, above, the Y-Coil will be configured into four rectangular coils, identified as Y1 through Y4.  To achieve this, the coils will be installed as discreet north/south segments, 2,000 feet in length, and labeled as Y1/Y3, Y1, Y3, Y2, Y4, and Y2/Y4.   The Y1/Y3 and Y2/Y4 segments will consist of nine turns of 500MCM cable, each, and either installed on the river bottom at grade inside protective HDPE conduit or in a shallow dredged trench backfilled with non-magnetic gravel.  Both ends of the cable segments will terminate inside a north and a south junction box after routing along the cable path. The Y1 and Y4 segments will consist of seven turns of 500MCM cable, each, and installed and terminated in similar fashion as the Y1/Y3 cable segments. The Y3 and Y2 segments will consist of three turns of 500MCM cable, each.  Unlike the previous four segments, these require installation at a depth of -110 feet MLLW.  To achieve this depth, these two cable segments will be installed using horizontal directional drilling technology.  This depth is required in order to satisfy system operational requirements and to ensure that the cables are installed in stable material suitable for drilling operations.  Each of the two segments will be encased in a protective conduit that will be installed as part of the drilling process.  Both ends of the cable segments will terminate inside a north and a south junction box after routing along the cable path.  The drilling equipment would rest on an anchored spud barge above the location where the cable coil is to enter the riverbed.  A guide pipe would be used to set the location where the cable loop would enter the riverbed.  The guide pipe will be fixed to the river bottom using a structural beam, referred to as an H-pile, so that it remains in constant position.  The drilling would proceed down the guide pipe to an elevation of -110 feet MLLW.  Upon achieving the selected depth, the drill would turn in a 60-inch radius and travel horizontally at the required depth to the exit point.   From here, the drill would travel through a second 60-inch radius turn toward the surface and proceed through the water column to a second barge carrying the conduit.  Once the drill has reached the second barge, the installation of the conduit would begin by pulling it back through the enlarged hole created by a back-reaming tool.  The drilling equipment would be used to pull the conduit through!   the hole, and the cable would then be pulled through the conduit.  The east-west segments of the Y-Coils would be routed along the bottom in a shallow dredged trench, to a designated junction box platform for termination. Power to the Y-Loop segments will be provided by a single twisted-pair of 500MCM cables routed from the west side of the new deperming control building to one of the junction box platforms, utilizing the shallow dredged trench. The installation tolerance for the directionally drilled loop cables is within ?3 feet of their planned locations, in the X, Y, and Z planes.   2.4	ADS Software and Hardware All software and associated hardware to be used to control and monitor the magnetic treatment process will be provided and installed by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD).

<DESC>Introduction:

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to enter into an agreement with one or more Information Technology (IT) companies in order to facilitate the collection and reporting of currently unattainable DSCP Subsistence Food Service sales and National Allowance Pricing Agreement (NAPA) related data. This data is necessary to track, analyze, and audit the effectiveness of the current NAPA program and provide a means for capturing all allowances due to the government. 

This program will also help to quantify DSCP Subsistence buying power for increased leverage with partnered manufacturers. DSCP Prime Vendors who hold contracts with DSCP and NAPA manufacturers will partner with one or more DSCP selected IT provider(s). The selected IT provider(s) will provide access to a secure web site that will enable DSCP, the Prime Vendor and the NAPA manufacturers to access their specific data. NAPA manufacturers will ultimately be responsible for paying for this service. 

Each partner - DSCP, DSCP Prime Vendors, NAPA Manufacturers and the IT firm providing the service - will benefit from this agreement by having access to their specific information including sales, allowances, usage, etc. in a secure Web based format. 

This data collection and reporting process will be demonstrated during a test and will need to include at a minimum: 

?	The ability to track, ensure the proper allocation of allowances from all NAPA sources. 
?	The ability to access all relevant reports via a secure World Wide Web site.
?	The ability to supply Local Stock Number (LSN) based and National Stock Number (NSN) based NAPA item usage reports and installation/customer usage reports.

DSCP is open to alternative ideas. Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternatives that can help DSCP better define its requirements and obtain a collection and reporting solution that meets its needs.

Purpose of Request For Information:

The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to help DSCP understand the capabilities of the software solutions and to identify qualified vendors who might be able to meet our future requirements.

Description of Information requested:

All vendors are invited to submit a Capability Statement and contact information. The Capability Statement should discuss the capabilities of the potential solution to satisfy DSCP?s requirements and any other pertinent information that would enhance DSCP?s understanding of the information submitted.
Disclaimer:

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>The Marine Corps is considering procuring an overhead (OH) concealment system for their  Family of Light Armored Vehicles (FOLAV) which consists of five variants: LAV 25 (Turreted), LAV L (Logistics), LAV M (Mortar), LAV R (Recovery), and the LAV C2 (Command and Control). It is estimated that a total of 944 overhead kits will be required to equip these variants and the majority of kits will be configured for the LAV 25   A common configuration of the overhead concealment kit is desired.  However, it m ay vary slightly between variants.<BR>If the Marine Corps decides to proceed with this program, it is anticipated that production kits would be developed, built and tested in Fiscal Year 2008, and that contract(s) for production of the estimated 944 kits w ould be awarded in the same time frame.  <BR>Each kit shall provide at least the following common characteristics for performance, equipment and capabilities:<BR>OH system shall provide concealment to the Vehicle Commander (VC) and Gunner from sniper fire/ targeting <BR>OH system shall provide protection to VC and Gunner from adverse weather exposure (sun, rain, wind, etc.) (KPP)<BR>OH system shall protect VC and Gunner from thrown objects, mainly sides and rear (KPP)Gunner shall have 360? situational awaren ess and ability to fire weapon in all angles/directions (KPP)<BR>VC shall be able to maintain 360? situational awareness when the OH system is in full use<BR>OH system shall allow for unrestricted airflow<BR>OH system shall have no adverse affect on platfo rm systems/subsystems operation and performance (KPP)<BR>OH system shall not affect thermal signature of platform (KPP)<BR>OH system shall provide the ability for crew member to ingress/egress without restriction (KPP)<BR>OH system shall be kit-able for fi eld installation (user will be able to install, repair, and replace in the field)<BR>OH system design shall have minimal impact on platform configuration<BR>Note: An LAV user group desired the OH system to be used when stationary only however, use of the O H system while on-the-move will be considered.<BR>Note: While the kit must provide these capabilities to both the gunner and VC, it can be developed as one for each.<BR>Interested contractors should submit a technical description of their overhead concealm ent system which best satisfies the potential draft requirements.  Rough pricing and production lead-time information is also desired.<BR>

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.     It is requested that the Marine Forces Reserve Band commission the composition of a Symphonic Wind Ensemble (Concert Band) work for the Marine Forces Reserve Band.  This request is in keeping with the intent of the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve of musically capturing the spirit of the City of New Orleans in an anthem of rebirth following the Hurricanes of 2005. 

2.     The overview of this project includes musically portraying the city of New Orleans and her people; their shared catastrophe of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, their separation and isolation as they were driven away and displaced throughout the United States, and their return, reunion and rebirth with a resolve to rebuild their city and their future.

3.	Composer should have the following capabilities:
           a.         Experience writing for Military Symphonic Bands.  The difference between military and civilian symphonic bands, is we have fewer Woodwinds (see Instrumenation list below), which the composer will need to take into consideration.

Military Symphonic Band Instrumentation:
       - 3 Flute/Piccolo
       - 5 Bb Clarinet
       - 1 Bass Clarinet
       - 1 Oboe
       - 1 Bassoon
       - 2 Alto Saxophone
       - 1 Tenor Saxophone
       - 1 Baritone Saxophone
       - 7 Trumpets
       - 3 French Horns
       - 3 Tenor Trombones
       - 1 Bass Trombone
       - 1 Euphonium
       - 3 Tubas
       - 5 Percussion (Full Battery)

**Civilian Symphonic Bands are used to having 9-12 Clarinets (where we have only 5), civlians have 5 Flutes, 2 Oboes, 2 Bassoons, etc...   The big difference is the instrumentation make up (listed above) which the Composer needs to know to avoid limitation and maximize our assets.

           b.       An understanding of the history of New Orleans and a working knowledge of the music associated with the city.

           c.       A knowledge of the events associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the damage to New Orleans, the evacuation, and the effects on the people separated from their city.

4.  The cost of this work shall include the following:

           a.       Composition of a Grade V/VI Concert work up to a length of 10 minutes.

           b.       Composer must make on-sight visit to the New Orleans area to:

       		(1)     Meet with the Commander of Marine Forces Reserve

       		(2)     Meet the Marine Forces Reserve Band who will be performing the work, and assess their capabilities and abilities.

       		(3)     Visit the New Orleans Metro area, tour and observe the Hurricane Damage, the areas that are devastated, the areas already recovered, the areas currently rebuilding, and those yet to be recovered.     This visit/tour is essential for the composer to truly capture - what has happened/is currently happening in the composition.

5.     The benefits to the Command and the Community are the community relations outreach project between the Marine Corps and the local areas that our military service and family members are a part of during their tour of duty.  To have this piece of music composed for the city and its people, and debuted by the Band that experienced the same tragedy, will further show and enhance the Military?s support and dedication to their host community.  The Concert event that will debut this composition will gain positive National media attention for the Marine Corps and the Local Community.

6.     The follow-on benefits to the Command are that after the Marine Forces Reserve Band has debuted this work, it will be available world-wide for High Schools, Universities, and Professional Wind Ensembles to perform this piece.     The performance notes of this piece will include that it was commissioned by the Marine Forces Reserve for the City of New Orleans, continuing to pass on the original community relations intent of this work, and further enhancing/maintaining a positive image of the Marine Corps to National/International audiences.

<DESC>The Navy's Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility seeks to obtain market research information on a replacement system to the current Rotor Spin Drive System.  Systems utilizing Air, Electricity or other drive techniques will be considered for the proposed requirement for the Fiscal Year 2009 timeframe.  If a contract is awarded, a firm fixed price contract is contemplated.  

This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind.  Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to develop an acquisition strategy for the proposed requirement.  Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received, and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Navy and /or released to the public. Responses will not be returned and no evaluation of the responses will be provided; however the Navy will provide feedback via written letter as soon as practical after the closing date of the synopsis.  The main purpose of this Sources Sought is to gain a better understanding of existing industry products and capabilities, including a budgetary estimate to buy and maintain any system that might be presented by industry.

The Rotor Spin Facility (RSF) in the Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility (PSEF), Bldg. 2360, at the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division in Patuxent River, MD is responsible for conducting test and evaluation of fan, compressor and hot section rotating components used in military gas turbine engines to determine life-limiting characteristics.  In a typical current test article assembly, a test rotor is mounted on an arbor and suspended vertically on a drive shaft from the Drive System in a pendulum configuration. The test rotor is typically not supported by bearings.  The drive shaft can vary from 3/16 to 1 1/4 inches and is dependent on the rotor and the planned maximum rotor speed.  A slip ring is mounted on top for rotor/airfoil data transfer.  Currently the test laboratory uses multiple drive turbines to operate in 36, 48, 60, and 100 inch diameter test cells. 

The Navy is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Navy requirements.   The goal of seeking a replacement system is to shorten test duration, increase speed control accuracy, and reduce test costs, test space and operating cost.   Information on capable sources is sought for the following requirements:

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the water distribution and wastewater collection systems at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.  Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  

In conjunction with the conveyance of the systems, the Contractor will be required to provide utility services, including improvements, upgrades, repairs, expansions, investments, and plant replacement, as well as continued operation and maintenance of the utility distribution systems.  Additionally, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental services for the conveyed systems.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. ?2688 ? Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter ?Notice?) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm on Tuesday, February 19, 2008.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government?s use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March-April 2008 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

Installation Description

Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) is located in Harford County midway between Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware. It occupies more than 72,500 acres in Harford County, Maryland. The installation is served by two major arteries, U.S. Route 40 and interstate 95, both of which connect with the New Jersey Turnpike and the Baltimore-Washington Expressway. 
Aberdeen Proving Ground?s northernmost point is marked by the confluence of the Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay. On the south it is bordered by the Gunpowder River. The installation comprises two principal areas, separated by the Bush River. The northern area is known as the Aberdeen Area, and the southern sector, formerly Edgewood Arsenal, is the Edgewood Area. The two areas were administratively combined in 1971. APG property not attached to the main installation includes the Churchill Test Site in Harford County and Carroll Island and Grace's Quarters in Baltimore County. Aberdeen Proving Ground is home to more than 50 tenants and a host of satellite activities. Among the major tenants are the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (APG's parent command), U.S. Army Ordnance Center and School, U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center, U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Defense Command, U.S. Army Environmental Center, U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine, Northeast Region Civilian Personnel Operations Center, U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for the Chemical Defense, Program Manager for Chemical Demilitarization, 203rd Military Intelligence Battalion and major elements of the Army Research Laboratory. 
As a center for Army materiel testing, laboratory research and military training, the post is a key element in the nation's defense. All tanks and wheeled vehicles which have served U.S. forces for the past 50 years have been tested for performance and durability at APG - from the M4 Sherman tank of World War II to the MI tank and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle of today. Known as the "Home of Ordnance," APG has been training Army ordnance personnel since 1918. The Army's ordnance training was consolidated at the proving ground during World War II and today the U.S. Army Ordnance Center and School provides mechanical maintenance training for more than 20,000 U.S. and foreign personnel each year. OC&S also is regimental headquarters for the Army's Chief of Ordnance. 
U.S. Army Garrison, Aberdeen Proving Ground, provides general, administrative and logistical support to the post's tenants and satellite activities, and is responsible for the management and operation of the entire installation, which in many ways is like a small city. There are more than 2,200 buildings, with more than 14 million square feet of floor space. The post has over 300 miles of improved roads, 30 miles of railroad and more than 567,000 square yards of airfield pavement.  The post is also Harford County's largest employer and one of the largest employers in the state of Maryland.

As the work will be perform ed outside of the continental U.S. no set asides or socioeconomic preference of any sort will be granted. This contract will provide a vehicle for construction of large projects to include complete bases, bridges, roads, runways, hangers, hospitals or clin ics, barracks, police stations and training facilities and various other types of industrial and military buildings.  Small construction projects may include installation of Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (ATFP) measures such as fencing, vehicle barriers,  security lighting, intrusion detection and surveillance systems, physical barriers, and blast and splinter window protection.  In addition work related to Entry Control Points (ECP) is anticipated, with structures, equipment, and site improvements includi ng roadways, gatehouses, guard shelters, traffic control devices, search areas, corridor barriers, electronic security systems, security monitoring and access control systems, windows and window treatments and blast protection/mitigation measures.  This in cludes general construction supporting these activities (architectural, electrical, mechanical and civil disciplines). <BR><BR>To a lesser extent (expected to be less than 25% of total RFPs), services may also be provided such as general building renovatio n, road and pavement repair, installation of equipment, incidental minor construction, design or A-E services, excavation, sitework and landscaping, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete work, transportation and vehicle/equipme nt rental, life support and base provisioning (cooking, laundry, janitorial services, etc.), as well as the supply of general or specialized labor types. In addition, the contract may provide for general environmental work including, but not limited to, en vironmental remedial work. The work performed will include providing all facilities, plans, labor, transportation, materials, equipment, and the performance of all work necessary to design and complete the project. <BR><BR>More than one contract will be aw arded as a result of this solicitation.  As individual projects are identified, they will generally be communicated to all of the IDIQ contract holders using a Request for Proposal (RFP).  IDIQ Contract holders will provide a short proposal to the Governme nt for each project they are interested in and the Government will award each project as a task order to the IDIQ using a shortened evaluation process.   The winning offeror will be required to provide a Bank Letter of Assurance in the amount of 10% of the  task order amount or a performance bond or letter of credit for 100% of the task order amount.  Although smaller or larger projects may be offered, most should be expected to be between $5 and $50 million.  The majority of the projects will be awarded as firm fixed price task orders.  Projects that are particularly complex or have greater uncertainties may be offered as some form of a cost reimbursable task order.  These will only be offered to those firms demonstrating that they have US Government-approve d accounting and estimating systems; evidence of this will be submitted at the time of initial IDIQ proposal evaluation.  IDIQ contracts will be awarded as a ba se year with four one year option periods renewable annually.  Total procurement for all contracts combined is expected to exceed $2 billion over five years.<BR><BR>To help us craft our solicitation to be more in line with commercial practices, we are host ing an industry day to foster better communication between ourselves and industry.

<SUBJECT>D -- Oracle Database Software
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."
The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires renewal of technical support for Oracle Corporation's database software and associated equipment. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Oracle, Inc, 1910 Reston Way, Reston, VA 20190 via the DOD Enterprise Software Imitative (ESI) blanket purchase agreement. Current DOD/ AF policy is to utilize ESI agreements, whenever they exist, for all software contracts. The required Oracle software is available under ESI. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-6967, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Tuesday, 22 January, 2008, 4:00 p.m. EST.
Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:
22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
Purchasing another database software is not an option since Oracle is institutionalized at SOCOM. There are many applications containing embedded PL/SQL that are not compatible with another brand of database software. Furthermore, there are a number of applications using products from Oracle Application Server Suite that also not compatible with another vendors' product. To replace the existing database software with a similar product, such as Microsoft?s SQL Server 2005 Enterprise Edition would cost the Government approximately $ 600,000.00. This figure assumes a cost of $25,000.00 (obtained through internet market research) and multiplied by 24 (the minimum number of licenses needed to operate).  This figure does not include the additional cost that would be required to retrain SOCOM personnel on the use of the new system. In summary, to purchase another brand of database software would involve substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.

1.  BACKGROUND
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) seek interested parties to become partners in the Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation, CORANET III (herein referred to as CORANET) to actively participate in scheduled workshops, meetings, and short-term collaborative projects, for the purpose of arriving at scientific and technical solutions to improving the efficiency of the combat ration industry and its manufacturing supply chain.. In FY 2006 the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia sold $3.9B in subsistence goods and services to the Department of Defense, making it DSCP?s largest supply chain.  Sales in subsistence continue to grow, largely due to requirements for operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.  The Combat Rations Network (CORANET) is a DOD Manufacturing Technology Program for technology implementation sponsored by the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia.  CORANET was established in 1996 to develop and introduce modern manufacturing processes into the U.S. industrial base to assure timely availability of affordable, high quality, high variety combat rations to the warfighters.  The scope of the CORANET program includes all of the manufacturing technologies related to the production, storage and distribution of combat rations.  These rations include individual rations such as Meals, Ready to Eat (MREs) as well as unitized group rations.   The goal of the CORANET program is to fulfill DSCP?s mission by improving the efficiency of the combat ration industry and its manufacturing supply chain.  Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $2 million per year for 7 years is planned during Fiscal Years 2009-2015.  This investment shall be for funding of Partner contracts and short-term projects (STPs).  Interested parties can visit the CORANET website at www.coranet2.org  to obtain more information about the current program.
2.  GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION 

Proposers must submit an original and eight (8) hard copies of full proposals (as well as an electronic file) and refer to BAA# 02-0008 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on March 5, 2008, in DSCP-Business Opportunities Office, Bldg 36, 2nd floor, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111 in order to be considered. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by DLA.  DSCP encourages industry, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions to submit proposals under this BAA.  However, no portion of this BAA shall be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology. For purposes of this acquisition, the small business size standard is 500 employees and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail or fax is preferred. Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded. 

3.  PROGRAM INFORMATION

CORANET is a ?community of practice? engaging academic and industrial research partners with the diverse collection of government agencies and programs that oversee and administer the development, production and distribution of military rations.
All of the participants meet at regularly scheduled workshops.  They work collaboratively to identify problems and needed improvements and to define solutions.  Research solutions are demonstrated and implemented through short term projects conducted by a collaboration of academic and industry partners and overseen by the appropriate government representatives.  

CORANET STRUCTURE
The CORANET program is made up of CORANET Partners who engage in short term research projects (STPs) under the oversight of the Joint Steering Group (JSG).  Project development and review is performed at CORANET Workshops.

PARTNERS
DSCP contemplates awarding multiple partner contracts.  The period of performance of the partner contract is expected to be 7 years with a 2-year base period and five 1-year option periods.  New partners chosen to participate are eligible to receive an estimated amount of up to $20,000 per calendar year for authorized travel and related costs to attend and actively participate in CORANET workshops and other Government sponsored meetings.  Selected partners shall have the option to receive or decline Partner funding, however all partners shall be required to attend CORANET sponsored meeting regardless of funding levels.  Registration fees for CORANET workshop attendance are waived for the first two partners attending from each organization.  Each partner is required to bring specific technical expertise that lends itself to significant improvements of the combat ration industry?s ability to meet DLA combat ration needs.  The potential technical areas of expertise include, but are not limited to four principal areas: (1)Food science and technologies, including food chemistry, food microbiology, new product development , sensory and quality evaluation, process unit operation and GMP; (2) Material science and engineering including polymer science and engineering, material joining technologies, mechanical properties, permeabilities; (3) Sensors and database management including: inspection methods, on-line sensors, data interchange and database, asset visibility and tracking; (4) Operations including: production control, process flow and efficiency, supply chain interaction and management, 	computer aided design and operation, process automation.  The focus of CORANET is for all partners to actively and continuously assist DLA in improving its ability to meet/exceed a varying range of military requirements through research, development and technology transfer efforts as they apply to the combat ration and related industries.

JOINT STEERING GROUP
The JSG oversees all CORANET activities.  It is made up of government representatives from the Military Services, Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Defense Logistics Agency, USDA, VETCOM, and the Natick Soldier Systems Center.

WORKSHOPS AND MEETINGS
The CORANET Partners and the JSG meet three times a year at workshops to review ongoing projects, identify new areas for CORANET investment, review proposed projects, review CORANET procedures and processes, keep abreast of new technologies, and understand DLA/DSCP and Service combat rations needs and requirements.  Additional CORANET meetings may be scheduled as needed.

SHORT TERM PROJECTS
CORANET research is done through the award of short short-term projects that develop and adapt modern manufacturing processes to be implemented within the industrial base to assure the prompt and sustained availability, variety, quality and affordability of combat rations.  Short term projects have an expected duration of 12-24 months and an average funding level of $100-150K per year.  All STPs are required to have a business case, developed in advance to include specific metrics for success as well as ROI where applicable.  To assure that 1) All CORANET STPs are fully documented; 2) All projects have the potential for implementation in industry; 3) That all projects address a specific DLA/DSCP/DOD need, a typical CORANET project shall have an academic partner, industrial partner and government sponsor.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

The laboratory will receive deliveries, which will be comprised of a batch/set of samples packed and labeled separately.  Each one of samples within the batch/set must be analyzed in a separate way for one or several tests.  Each sample's label should show the sample?s code and specify which type of test(s) needs to be performed on that sample.  Each sample of soil or sediment will be packed in double sealed transparent plastic bags, having about 100 grams and properly labeled.  Each sample of water, spray mixture, or glyphosate formulation will be packed in a plastic bottle, having about 600 to 1.000 milliliters and properly labeled. 

Codes for sample identification must be carefully observed and retained in the original capital letter codes as it is stamped on the label of each sample when reporting.  Minimal misspellings might lead to confusions.  References to analytical methods used must appear on the report of results, as well as references to the brand/model of scientific equipment? especially in the case of tests # 1 through # 4.  Analysis reports should be delivered to NAS within one month of receipt of the samples.

Samples will be sent to the contractor for analysis over a period of one year.  There is not a fixed time interval between deliveries.  The government expects to deliver a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve batches/sets during the year.  The expected amount of samples per batch/set will be between four and eight.  Therefore, the expected minimum and maximum thresholds of samples will be twenty-four and ninty-six samples per year.  The offeror's proposal should include return shipping and any other costs expected to be incurred.

EVALUATION OF OFFERS

The US Government will award an IDIQ contract with a performance period of one year as a result of this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer is technically acceptable, conforms to the solicitation, and is the most advantageous to the Government.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.
