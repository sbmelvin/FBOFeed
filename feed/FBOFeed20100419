This office is requesting quotes on the following item:  Accreditation Audit Review services.Background.  Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) is a national Indian community college operated by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  SIPI was founded in 1971 with the goal of providing post-secondary education opportunities for American Indians and Alaska Natives from federally recognized tribes from throughout the United States.  Instructional offerings include a two-year transfer programs, one and two-year career and technical education programs, short course occupational programs, adult basic education, and a high school diploma program.  Classes are offered on the Albuquerque campus and at various tribal distance learning sites.  SIPI was designated a Land Grant Institution in 1994.  Land Grant status facilitates the development of food and agriculture science programs involving teaching, community outreach, and research. SIPI's student body is comprised of American Indian students from across the country; students generally are 18 years-old and older, although 17 year olds are sometimes admitted.  The average annual enrollment is 800-900 students with over 100 American Indian and Alaskan Native tribes represented. In 2000, SIPI was granted a 10 year accreditation status (2000-2010) by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.  On December 7-9, 2009, SIPI completed a 10 year comprehensive site visit to reaffirm its accreditation status. A team representing the HLC conducted the site evaluation.  In preparation, of the visit, over a year and a half, SIPI engaged in a process of self-study, addressing the Commissions requirements and 5 criteria for accreditation.Services in audit review for accreditation are required so that SIPI can maintain accreditation status.  Accreditation has two fundamental purposes: quality assurance and program improvement.  Institutional accreditation evaluates an entire institution and accredits it as a whole.   It assesses formal educational activities and also evaluates governance and administration, financial stability, admissions and student personnel services, resources, student academic achievement, organizational effectiveness, and relationships with outside constituencies.  The Commission accredits approximately 1100 institutions of higher education in a nineteen state region.  The Commission is recognized by the U.S Department of Education. As a federal college that is funded and operated by the Department of Interior, it is difficult to take the day to day operational information and formulate into standard accounting reports.  The Department of Interior and BIA/BIE have standard audits, but they do not contain detailed information about SIPI.  From the recent visit it has become apparent that the college will need to develop its own stand alone audit / financial reporting process to meet the reporting requirements of the HLC. 
Scope.  This project will consist of a review of current financial information and procedures for SIPI, a review of reporting requirements for HLC accreditation, and the development of a process that uses information captured in SIPI's financial database and reorganizes it into a financial statement format that HLC can use to compare SIPI with other institutions of higher learning and complies with all federal regulations. The vendor must ensure that all recommendations and reporting requirements are documented to sufficiently comply with all relevant guidance including, but not limited to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and HLC fiscal reporting requirements.
Objectives.  The overall objective for this project is to develop an understanding of the identified weakness in the financial reporting to the HLC and develop and assist in the implementation of new procedures required to correct the weakness. The four main objectives will be to:a.  Determine areas of fiscal reporting deficiency relative to HLC accreditation reporting requirements.b.  Review SIPI fiscal information and FFS capabilities with respect to information requirements for HLC accreditation.c.  Develop and report recommendations for an annual process to close the documented reporting gaps.d.  Work with SIPI personnel to develop a comprehensive report through the  implementation of the new reporting process.
Tasks.  The Contractor shall develop an understanding of the identified weakness in the financial reporting to the HLC and the processes and procedures required to correct the weakness.
The Contractor will assess SIPI's core financial management system (FFS) to determine the reporting gaps and issues that exist between those mandated by the HLC and the information available. This assessment needs to consider the HLC information reporting requirements, audit standards, statutory requirements, and the agency's enterprise financial management system and business processes.
The Contractor will develop a thorough understanding of the qualifications and responsibilities of SIPI personnel responsible for financial information.
The Contractor shall assist in establishing the reporting structure, roles and responsibilities, and training, and will assist SIPI finance and accounting personnel to implement the recommendations developed as part of this project.
SIPI anticipates the possible need for follow up support and assistance in implementing the recommendations developed as a part of this project. Follow up Ad Hoc support will be authorized on an hourly basis, not to exceed the total amount of hours authorized. When an Ad Hoc support requirement is identified, SIPI will request that the contractor provide an estimate of number of hours required by the senior level accountant to perform the effort.
The contractor has no authority to incur material costs without the explicit prior written approval of the contracting officer.
Deliverables.  All deliverables shall conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
The vendor will provide an "Overview Report" on the budget and finance processes for the college and how they apply to the HLC reporting requirements. This report will also detail those areas of the HLC reporting requirements that are not applicable to the federal college and will highlight any information that, if compared with other institutions of higher learning, would provide inconclusive results due to SIPI's organization as a federal entity.
The vendor will provide a "Recommendations Report" that will outline recommendations to bridge the gap between the financial systems of the federal government and the reporting requirements for accreditation.  These recommendations may, to the extent feasible, offer alternatives to HLC requirements that would enable HLC to compare SIPI to other institutions of higher learning. 
Using the process and procedures developed in the Recommendations Report, the vendor will provide a fiscal report / audit detailing specific information and financial ratios that are required by the Higher Learning Commission in the evaluation and accreditation process.  
All reports shall: a.  Clearly describe issues, applicable criteria, findings, conclusions, and recommendations. b.  Include sufficient detail to convince a general audience of the validity and significance of the facts, conclusions, and recommendations. c.  Contain an index linking each major issue to supporting items, discussions and information / data. 
After delivery and receipt by SIPI, there will be a two-week (14-day) period for review and acceptance of each deliverable by SIPI.
Government Furnished Property.  SIPI will accommodate the needs of the contractor to hold meetings and other engagement as best as possible. When work is required onsite, the contractor and employees will be furnished with office space, office phone, office supplies, computers and printers, and access to copy and fax machines. Other than mutually agreed upon facilities, there will not be any Government Furnished Property or Facilities available for use in performance of this project.

Place of Performance.  The contractor will work both on and off the Albuquerque SIPI campus; contractor will gather and review data and information from faculty, staff and programs; as well as perform interviews of current and former employees through telephone phone or on/off campus. Other mutually agreed upon events may be held at other designated locations agreed upon between the contractor and SIPI President. 
Period of Performance.  The project should begin in April 27, 2010 and conclude by July 31, 2010. 
Qualification of Expert Provider:  a.  This contract shall be contingent upon acceptance of lead personnel by SIPI and such personnel shall be expected to remain in place for the duration of the contract. The lead person shall be the contractor's Senior Level Accountant assigned to the project. This individual shall be a Certified Public Accountant with a minimum of 3 to 5 years of experience performing financial statement audits for Federal agencies.b.

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open CompetitionDue to Sole Source RequirementApril 19, 2010Solicitation Number: VA-244-10-RP-0210Erie VAMC135 East 38th StreetErie, PA 16504Items to be procured:The requirement is to provide one of the following:Liebert 208 Volt, 60HZ, 3 Phase DS Precision Cooling System: Model DS035WUC0EI543A     "	Nominal 035 kW (10 ton) Water/Glycol Cooled Downflow System withCleanable paradenser heat exchanger with a net sensible cooling capacity of 98,100 BTUH at 72F, 50% RHMust purchase brand name as described and exact model in order to be compatible with current system in place.  This is essential to the government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  The purchase of this unit would preclude Erie VAMC from modifying the existing utility that is already in place, which would cause the Erie VAMC to incur additional costs. Purchasing this unit is compatible with the backup Liebert cooling system already in place and software that has been installed that automatically transfers units when one fails.  Current unit is failing - if the unit fails when the warm weather arrives, the Erie VAMC could be as risk for losing all data on IT servers.   The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."Market research indicates that Liebert 208 Volt, 60HZ, 3 Phase DS Precision Cooling System: Model DS035WUC0EI543A is only available from a sole source.  It is requested that this contract be awarded to the following vendor (a large business):   Emerson Network Power - Liebert22 McCormick RoadMcKees Rocks, PA 15136Notice of Intent to Sole Source was posted to https://www.fbo.gov/ on 04/19/2010 with the expectation that the solicitation will be issued is no later than 04/21/2010 with intent to award no later than 04/30/2010.Any inquiries and/or requests for solicitation must be submitted in writing to Cynthia Grygier, Contract Specialist at cynthia.grygier@va.gov

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the Contractor evaluation/teardown, repair/upgrade or overhaul/upgrade and test of Government-owned items applicable to the Air Traffic Control Beacon Interrogator (ATCBI-6).  Raytheon is the authorized source of repair/overhaul and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the ATCI-6.  The FAA contemplates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Requirements contract with one base and four one-year option periods to fulfill this requirement.
The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate with Raytheon Network Centric Systems Marlboro, MA in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.
The determination to solicitation and negotiate with only one firm is necessitated and supported by the fact that Raytheon owns the proprietary data rights associated with the equipment to be repaired under the contemplated contract. The design and proprietary data rights exclusively available to Raytheon include all manufacturing specification data required for the repair of the ATCBI-6 equipment.  
This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.  
Interested Parties may contact the Contracting Officer Kathrine T. Budd (email kathrine.budd@faa.gov) by email only.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS PLEASE

PLEASE NOTE:  PRESOLICITATION NOTICE "NIH-NICHD-CDBPM-10-15-PS" REPLACES "NIH-NICHD-CDBPM-10-15" POSTED ON APRIL 16, 2010.  THIS RENUMBERING REFLECTS AN ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGE ONLY.  ALL CONTENT, SUBSTANCE, AND INTENT OF THE ORIGINAL NOTICE REMAINS UNCHANGED.


This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  This is not a request for technical or cost proposals.  No solicitation is available at this time and requests for solicitation packages will not receive a response.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Center for Developmental Biology and Perinatal Medicine, has a requirement to develop multiplexed screening assays for newborn screening that can be automated and utilized in a high throughput environment.

The report, "Newborn Screening:  Toward a Uniform Screening Panel and System" (httm://mchb.hrsa.gov/screening), commissioned by the Health Resources and Services Administration, identifies some of these "high priority" conditions.

A three year, cost reimbursement type contract is anticipated with an award made on or about September 30, 2010.  The solicitation will be issued on or about May 3, 2010 in an electronic format only, on this web site (https://www.fbo.gov).

Proposals will be due thirty days after the date of the issuance of the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.

The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS 541712.

No collect telephone calls will be accepted.

Any VA facility within VISN 04 may order from contract(s) awarded under this solicitation.The contract will contain one (1) base year and up to three (3) renewable option years. The Contracting Officer shall determine (based on an integrated assessment of each offeror's technical and price proposals) the individual proposals judged to be most advantageous to the Government.  ?   The total guaranteed minimum of supplies and services that will be acquired under this contract is $500.00 per contract per year.  ?  The total maximum of supplies or services the Government will acquire under the contract is $220,000. ?  The Contractor must submit a Technical Proposal for evaluation.  The Technical Proposal must provide sufficient information to demonstrate the corporate capabilities to satisfactorily perform the work detailed.   GENERAL REQUIREMENTSStandards of PerformanceThe Contractor shall be required to attend all weekly VA custom shoe clinics or VA Community Living Center (CLC) appointments with a certified staff Pedorthist to provide support in evaluation of the patient, casting, fabrication, and fitting for all Orthopedic shoe modifications, amputee toe fillers, shoe repairs and related services in strict conformance to the prescription and VA guidelines that has been submitted by the designated VA requesting provider. Contractors shall not add or substitute components or alter the beneficiary's prescription in any way without prior approval and written authority from the appropriate VA Clinic Team, Prosthetic Representative or designee. Educational and Training RequirementsAll contractors shall have a full-time Pedorthist on staff at each of their locations, with current and valid credentials provided by the American Board for Certification (ABC), or Board for Orthotist-Prosthetist Certification (BOC).  The Pedorthist will have experience in casting, fabrication and modifying footwear and orthotics.  A waiver for this requirement may be granted on a case-by-case basis for branch offices only in the event that VA determines this requirement would place an undue burden on the Veteran. VA reserves the right to verify Pedorthist(s) credentials anytime during the term of this contract. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTSSolicitation of BeneficiariesThe contractor agrees not to (directly or indirectly through agents) solicit eligible Veteran beneficiaries. VA personnel shall not direct, guide, or prompt a Veteran beneficiary to a specific contractor except when a physician determines that it is a medical necessity.  It will continue to be VA's policy to permit all service-connected and non service-connected beneficiaries who have continuing eligibility and who have established ties with an existing Pedorthist to continue to use that Pedorthist provided that Pedorthist is willing to accept the current contract provider terms for the geographic area covered by the contract.SalvageIn the event that a Veteran beneficiary dies prior to delivery and acceptance of Prescription shoe work, VA shall pay the contractor for the work performed up to the point that they are notified to stop work. The pricing paid shall be mutually agreed upon and shall not exceed the contract price of the Prescription less the salvage value of the unused Modification.PERFORMANCE, DELIVERY, INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCEThe VA shall require the contractor to deliver items ordered under this contract no later than 15 calendar days after receipt of a delivery order.  The contractor shall notify the VA Prosthetic Representative and show cause in the event he is unable to deliver the required items in accordance with the Government's required delivery date.  Failure by the contractor to provide a written notification as stated above within 7 calendar days after receipt of an order constitutes acceptance of an order.In the event the Government desires expedited delivery, the ordering activity shall telephonically contact the contractor and inquire into the feasibility of obtaining this condition. The contractor shall respond within 24 hours to such request and expedited delivery shall be mutually agreed upon.  Any additional costs incurred by the contractor for meeting this requirement shall be negotiated in accordance with clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items. (Note: Expedited Delivery terms and conditions, when required, will be determined by the Contracting Officer or Ordering Officer on a case by case basis and stated in the individual task or delivery order)The conditions of and point of measurement, fitting, delivery, inspection, and acceptance of shoe modifications, amputee toe fillers, shoe repairs and/or related services shall be at the discretion of the appropriate VA Clinical Team, Prosthetic Representative or prescribing physician and will be determined on a case by case basis.The contractor warrants the Prescription and/or shoe repair provided against defective material and/or workmanship for a minimum of 90 calendar days from the date of acceptance.    Manufacturer's warranties of Material components that extend beyond the minimum 90-day period shall be in effect and also enforced.   The contractor agrees to furnish without additional cost to the government, all labor and materials necessary to correct defects that were detected during the warranty period.   These conditions do not apply to adjustments incidental to the device adjustments required by physical change of the wearer, or where there is evidence of deliberate misuse or alteration by anyone other than the contractor.The contractor shall immediately notify all effected VAMC (s) and contracting activities in the event of a product recall, removal, required adjustment, or required modification that is suggested or mandated by the contractor, distributor, manufacturer, or any regulatory or official agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The 23rd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron is seeking information from vendors who can provide positionable lighting at 50 aircraft sunshades for use in aircraft maintenance during hours of low visibility. Products utilizing battery, solar,&nbsp;AC/DC power, or&nbsp;combinations of these power sources&nbsp;are&nbsp;being considered. All technologies will be considered. Lighting&nbsp;products should be movable and posable&nbsp;to allow for maintainance personnel to position lights&nbsp;to illuminate aircraft access points at various angles with sufficient&nbsp;brightness. Sunshades are outdoors,&nbsp;and provide only overhead protection, so only products that are rugged&nbsp;and constructed/rated for outdoor applications will be considered.<br /><br />Limiting factors are a lack of DC power at the&nbsp;parking ramp, equipment usage by personnel on multiple shifts (24 hr) and a need for easy servicability of lighting units (changing bulbs/parts).<br /><br />In response to this notice, please provide company data,&nbsp;spec sheets, POC and&nbsp;contact info. No pricing information is sought at this time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Based on the response to this notice, the 23rd Contracting Squadron may establish a date for vendor demonstrations.<br /><br />This is a request for information only. The Government does not have an active requirement for these products at this time, and funding has not been allocated for purchase of aircraft sunshade lighting systems.

<DESC>1.  Background:  The Missile Defense Agency is responsible for developing a Ballistic Missile Defense System; integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends, and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack.

2.  Description:

A. Request for Information (RFI).  This is a Request for Information (RFI) on component capabilities for a for a high performance interceptor for the Missile Defense Agency.  The Agency is investigating options for developing the next generation of Standard Missile Three, designated the Block IIB, and targeted for Phase 4 of the Presidents Phased Adaptive Approach.  From its forward deployed location, the Block IIB interceptor is designed to defeat Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM).  A higher performing interceptor paired with Ballistic Missile Defense System sensors that detect and track threats with greater accuracy throughout their trajectory improves our chances of intercepting the enemy early, forces him to deploy countermeasures less effectively and improves our ability to handle raids.  The Agency seeks insight into the technology to demonstrate a prototype missile within five years.  Therefore, the Agency is requesting information primarily on components, boosters, and kinetic warheads concepts from industry, the national laboratories, universities and university affiliated research and development centers.  

B.    The Agency is requesting that contractors interested in this acquisition submit a capability statement that demonstrates core capabilities, technologies, and expertise.

The Agency requests you answer the following questions.  Please provide any technical data that justifies your performance or maturity assessments.  Describe a development and test effort to achieve technology readiness level - 6.  Describe the risks of achieving high performance and actions for mitigating those risks. 

To achieve the performance indicated for Phase 4 of the phased adaptive approach, preliminary analysis indicates we may need to increase the burnout velocity of our current SM-3 by one third and may require more than twice the divert velocity.   As an evolution of the SM-3 family of missiles, the SM-3, IIB must integrate with the Aegis Ashore Weapon System including the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System.  

1.  What are your component concepts for integration with the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System? Describe the propulsion characteristics of your booster stages including ballistic performance, mass fraction, and assess the maturity of the technology to reach that capability. 
2.  What techniques do you suggest we employ to reduce inert weight and gain velocity?  
3.  How do we achieve energy flexibility in the upper stage(s) and kinetic warhead?   If we decide to reuse the SM-3 Block IB Kinetic Warhead, how does this affect your component concepts? 
4.  What is your concept for a lighter weight payload (nosecone, ejector, kinetic warhead)?
5.  What Noise Equivalent Irradiance, divert impulse, and operating time do you think is achievable in a lighter weight kinetic warhead (under 30 kg)?  Describe seeker, propulsion (attitude control and divert), and avionics components. 
6.  What are the impacts of operating in a high velocity regime?  What are the key controllability characteristics?  How do you separate the stages in this regime?   
7.  How would you communicate with the missile in flight? 
8.  What are the key knowledge points we must prove before entering into product development? 
9.  What are your suggestions for acquiring this knowledge? 

C.  Place of performance.  Not applicable.  

D.  Government-Furnished Information (GFI) / Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE).  GFI/GFE is not applicable.  

E.

Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below listed products within +/-8 weeks after receipt of purchase order.







Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following:

Government Specifications for Bioreactor
The Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy Laboratory (GDBC/NHLBI/NIH) is seeking a bioreactor system for growing invertebrate cells in volumes ranging from 50 liters to 500 liters. There are two aspects to such a system, 1. the vessel and mechanical components, and 2. the system controller and data recorder.   The vessel consists of a support container that accommodates a sterile, single-use liner, often referred to as a bag. The bag is designed for maintaining cells in suspension using a mechanical agitator and provides a means for aseptically introducing the monitoring probes, withdrawing sample, introducing inocula, bottom drain port for harvesting, and venting through sterile filters. Either disposable or re-sterilizable probes are acceptable, provided that the probes communicate with the controller system. Temperature regulation is critically important and requires an external circulating chiller with sufficient power to raise the cell culture growth medium from 4oC to 28oC, and maintain that temperature indefinitely. Temperature set points of 37oC and 4oC are necessary as well for processing the material.

An additional requirement is that the starting volume is approximately 20 to 25% of the final volume. This allows the cell culture volume to be expanded in the same vessel / bag used for the final culture and production. The minimum working volume, referred to as the turn-down ratio, of 1:4 or 1:5 is essential and avoids the use of several feeder bioreactors to generate the material for large volume productions. For example, a 500 liter bioreactor with a 1:2 turn-down requires a minimum working volume of 250 liters whereas a 1:5 turn-down requires a minimum working volume of 100 liters. 

The working volume range of 50 to 500 liters may be achieved through two vessels with 1:5 turn-down: a 250 liter vessel (working volumes 50  250 liters) and a 500 liter vessel (working volumes 100  500 liters). 

The second component of the system regulates the culture conditions and maintains the optimum growth conditions. The parameters that require stringent regulation are: temperature, dissolved oxygen, and agitation. The acidity (or pH) of the culture is monitored, but not regulated. These parameters are regulated through a feedback loop that constantly makes adjustments depending on cell culture demands. For example, cells initially diluted to the final working volume have relatively low demands for oxygen. However, as the cell density increases, the oxygen demand also increases and the system has to respond by adjusting the gas flow and gas mixture (typically a mix of oxygen and air is used).

<DESC>MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY SERVICES FOR NEUROTHERAPEUTICS (MCNP)
<p>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT - NINDS-SB-SS-10-02</p>
<p>PURPOSE: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has a requirement for medicinal chemistry services. The NINDS envisions awarding a contract for medicinal chemistry services as part of a new Medicinal Chemistry for Neurotherapeutics Program (MCNP), which is designed to help overcome barriers to drug development for diseases that affect the nervous system.</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, and if your business concern is NOT a small business, there is no need to respond to this announcement. Once a determination is made regarding the suitability of this future requirement for a small business set-aside or an open competition to include both large and small business, a separate Pre-Solicitation Announcement will be issued in advance of the release of a Request for Proposals.<br />The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541711. Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 or fewer employees. Please note that in order to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside, at least 50% of the direct labor cost must be in-house. Specifically, FAR 52-219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting states that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. Submitted Capability Statements must address how the business meets the applicable size standard designated for this project.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The design of the MCNP is to provide neuroscientists with medicinal chemistry services to develop preclinical drug candidates-optimized drug leads that are ready for Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies. The MCNP will include the following components, which will interact as indicated:</p>
<p>&bull; A medicinal chemistry facility (Contractor). The Contractor will provide compound design, synthesis, and management services, as well as in vitro pharmacology and toxicology assays for the purposes of improving the drug-like qualities of compounds.<br />&bull; Neuroscience researchers (Contributors) with bioactive small molecule compounds and bioactivity assays. The Contributors' compounds will serve as starting points for medicinal chemistry. The Contributors, using their own bioactivity assays, will test compounds provided by the medicinal chemistry Contractor. <br />&bull; NIH staff. The NIH Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) will oversee the medicinal chemistry contract. The COTR will offer suggestions and provide feedback to the Contractor on medicinal chemistry strategies and project design, in consultation with the Contributors and NIH-hired medicinal chemistry consultants (see below). <br />&bull; Medicinal chemistry consultants. The NIH will hire consultants to assist the COTR in reviewing proposals, reports, and data produced by the Contractor and Contributors. <br />&bull; Information Technology (IT) system. The NIH will establish a database and user-friendly interface for entering, searching, downloading, and visualizing medicinal chemistry data. The medicinal chemistry Contractor and Contributors will be responsible for entering the data that they generate into this database. All MCNP participants will receive training on how to use the IT system and technical support.</p>
<p>The MCNP will serve as part of the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network and provide medicinal chemistry for drug development projects independent of the Blueprint Network. The Blueprint Network offers neuroscience researchers access to a full range of industry-style drug development services and expertise, including medicinal chemistry, IND - enabling studies, and phase I clinical trial infrastructure. The goal of the Blueprint is to advance compounds successfully from chemical optimization through phase I clinical testing, at which point the compounds will be more attractive for private sector investment and commercial development. Medicinal chemistry for Blueprint projects will be supported through the base award and first option item of this contract award.</p>
<p>For drug development projects that are not a part of the Blueprint program, the NIH will acquire medicinal chemistry on a project-by-project basis through the exercise of option items under this contract. Preclinical drug candidates generated from these projects will undergo further development and testing through other NIH programs or within the academic or commercial sector.</p>
<p>The work of the Contractor will be divided into projects. In general, each project will involve a different Contributor. Projects will include any or all of the following stages: (1) Exploratory Chemistry, (2) Hit-to-Lead Chemistry, and (3) Lead Optimization. The goal of Exploratory Chemistry is to gather sufficient data to determine whether the starting compound(s) and primary bioactivity assay provided by the Contributor are suitable for pursuing Hit-to-Lead Chemistry. Exploratory Chemistry will generally include obtaining commercially available compounds that are structurally similar to the starting compound(s) ("SAR by catalog") and limited chemical synthesis of custom-designed analogs. The goal of Hit-to-Lead Chemistry is to develop one or more chemical series that demonstrate a mature SAR, successful outcomes in preliminary absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) assays, IC50/EC50 &lt; 100 nM in the primary bioactivity assay (potency in a cellular assay is desirable) and, if the Contributor has in vivo models, in vivo activity. For Lead Optimization, the goal is to develop a preclinical drug candidate with optimized ADME properties and minimal predicted toxicity. The Contractor must have sufficient capacity to support a workload comparable to any of the following combinations of projects: (1) 6 projects in Lead Optimization, concurrently; (2) 10 projects in Hit-to-Lead Chemistry, concurrently; and (3) 3 projects in Lead Optimization and 5 projects in Hit-to-Lead Chemistry, concurrently.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the following services during the contract: (1) project planning; (2) project management; (3) design, procurement, and milligram-scale synthesis of chemical analogs; (4) multi-gram and scale-up synthesis for testing in animal models; (5) in vitro pharmacology and toxicology testing for lead optimization; (6) compound registration and data entry; and (7) compound management.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the Blueprint program and of individual medicinal chemistry projects is to bring new drugs to market. To this end, the NIH has sought a Declaration of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) for this contract. The DEC enables the Contributors to retain control of the intellectual property for compounds created through the MCNP.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED: Your response should demonstrate your ability and related experience in a requirement-specific Capability Statement to: 1) Develop and implement strategies for medicinal chemistry optimization; 2) Provide milligram-scale and scale-up synthesis of chemical analogs; 3) Provide appropriate in vitro assays if it becomes necessary to explore the Structure-Activity Relationship around a particular pharmacological or toxicological property; 4) Provide compound management and registration services; 5) Rapidly scale chemistry capacity (including dedicated chemistry staff) up or down in order to support the anticipated workload. The Capability Statement should indicate how many chemists and other staff that the small business would be able to dedicate to such a contract, and which of those would be available in-house.</p>
<p>Please submit 3 copies of your response to the attention of Annette Carter, Contracting Officer at the address provided by 4:00 PM Local Time on Tuesday May 4, 2010. Electronic submittal will also be accepted at cartera@mail.nih.gov (please format for printing). You are encouraged to limit you response to fewer than 15 pages and your response must specifically address each of the requirement specific information requested items stated above. Generic marketing brochures will not be considered further.

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in">The Social Security Administration is pursuing several initiatives to speed up the disability determination process to allow eligible claimants to receive timely disability decisions. One such initiative is the concept of the Medical Record Data Viewer (MRDV), which makes it possible to take advantage of the data centric nature of electronic health records (EHR). The concept of the MRDV is to meet current functional needs, such as searching, sorting, filtering, summary and form display, and feature rich annotations for those who need to display, analyze, and document medical records during the disability determination process. The concept will also introduce new and dynamic functions using the structured data available in EHRs.</p>

<p>8. POSITION DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">A. Background</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Kosovo to develop into a peaceful, prosperous and democratic nation, the rule of law must be established and respected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An effective, independent and accountable justice system that upholds the law, protects the rights of all of its citizens and prosecutes powerful and ordinary individuals equally is a characteristic of a democratic society.<span style="COLOR: black"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, a reliable, efficient and fair justice system contributes to economic development by providing options to settle disputes, enforce obligations and protect commercial interests. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While establishing the rule of law is an essential element for Kosovo's economic growth and democratic development, there are a number of challenges facing the justice system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Key legislation, such as the Law on Courts, must be adopted and implemented; new institutions such as the Kosovo Judicial Council and Ministry of Justice were established only a few years ago; the reappointment and vetting process for all the country's judges and prosecutors just started this year; Courts have significant backlog; and a parallel justice system operates in the Kosovo Serb majority area in the North.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of these issues contribute to citizens' poor perception of the justice system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numerous factors contribute to these challenges to the justice system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kosovo declared its independence on February 17, 2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sixty five countries, including the United States and most (though not all) of the European Union countries have since recognized Kosovo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the world's newest country, Kosovo only recently assumed control and authority over its justice system from international actors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, there was no tradition of judicial independence under the <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN">Yugoslav legal system, since judges were viewed as bureaucrats who carried out the Government's agenda. T</span>he current legal system, which was inherited from the UN Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK), consists of a mix of Yugoslav laws passed before March 28, 1989, non-discrimination laws approved after 1989, UNMIK regulations, and international human rights conventions. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This intricate legal structure often leads to confusion on the part of judges, lawyers and government officials about which laws applies and supremacy of laws.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most of Kosovo's courthouses were designed as office buildings, which results in insufficient number of courtrooms, so the bulk of judicial proceedings are conducted behind closed office doors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kosovo's independence is supervised by the international community under the Comprehensive Proposal for Status Settlement drafted by UN Special Envoy Marti Ahtisaari in March 2007 and accepted by the Government of Kosovo (GOK).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This document (known informally as Ahtisaari), stipulates the basic framework for Kosovo's governance as a multi-ethnic society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It provides for an International Civilian Representative (ICR) who heads the International Civilian Office, and also serves as European Union Special Representative, to monitor compliance with the Ahtisaari requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) has assumed responsibilities formerly exercised by UNMIK for support for rule of law and policing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The European Commission Liaison Office (ECLO) provides assistance to the judiciary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>UNMIK has significantly reduced its presence and is largely focused upon the Northern areas that border with Serbia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly OSCE has reduced its presence in rule of law institutions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An International Judicial and Prosecutorial Commission (IJPC) was created as a temporary body, staffed by international and Kosovo experts working under the Kosovo Judicial Commission, to establish an independent and professional judiciary and prosecution service,.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the challenges are great and the issues are complex, t<span style="COLOR: black">he timing is right for sustained engagement in and support for rule of law development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN">Kosovo's newly adopted Constitution gives independence and power to the judicial branch. This provides a solid foundation for strengthening judicial institutions and improving their ability to uphold and apply the law. Moreover, </span>there are several pieces of pending legislation, such as the Law on Courts, which will lead to significant changes in the operations of the justice system. <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN">Finally, significant investments by USAID and other donors laid the framework for additional reform efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 3pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the past decade, USAID funded several justice sector reform programs to tackle some of these challenges.<span style="COLOR: black"> USAID projects focused on such issues as developing a </span>strategy for administration of justice, creating an accounting system to enable the courts to collect fees, establishing a security system for the courts, and producing a transparent procurement system for the courts. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>These investments are now starting to show concrete results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Kosovo Judicial Council (KJC) was created in <span style="COLOR: black">April 2006 with the mandate to formulate policy, implement regulations for the courts, oversee the development of a fully functioning independent judiciary, and recommend to the President of Kosovo judicial candidates to fill vacancies in the various courts under its purview.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With USAID assistance, KJC </span>established systemic court performance measures, developed and implemented time standards for all Kosovo courts, standardized court fees and expenses system-wide and developed a judicial code of ethics. <span style="COLOR: black">Furthermore, a host of other key institutions have been created in the last couple of years including the </span>Ministry of Justice and the Kosovo Judicial Institute. Through a Model Court program, backlog reduction plans are being implemented, court staffs are participating in management and leadership training, court facilities are being modernized and customer service is improving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These are important steps in helping the rule of law firmly take root in Kosovo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 3pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">USG assistance for support of the judicial system has taken a number of forms.&nbsp;Currently, USAID has funded the following activities: </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: black">Kosovo Justice Support Program (JSP):</span></strong><span style="COLOR: black"> The general purpose of the ongoing JSP is to further develop the rule of law in Kosovo by making contributions in the areas of: (1) building capacity for the Kosovo Judicial Council (KJC)</span><span style="mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN"> to operate, effectively and efficiently</span><span style="COLOR: black">; (2) </span><span style="mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN">improving</span><span style="COLOR: black"> court administration; (3) </span><span style="mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN">improving </span><span style="COLOR: black">ethics and professionalism of judges and court Staff; (4) ensuring minority access to and representation in the justice system by </span><span style="mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN">supporting the transformation of the court system to more effectively represent and serve the non-Albanian populations</span><span style="COLOR: black">; (5) </span><span style="mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN">developing the Ministry of Justice Legal Drafting and Policy Formulation/Guidance Skills</span><span style="COLOR: black">; and (6) </span><span style="mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN">establishing and supporting the organization and critical tools necessary to build an effective Public Prosecutors' Service</span><span style="COLOR: black">. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 3pt"><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Legal Professional Development Initiative:<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">is implemented by American Bar Association's Rule of Law Initiative.</span> Currently, ABA/ROLI focuses on legal education and <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN">legal profession reform. It supports legal education through efforts such as a clinical legal education program, a 'praktikant' (legal internship) program, and ethics courses. It works closely with the Kosovo Chamber of Advocates and Judges' Association on codes of conduct and organizational development. ABA/ROLI also produces regular updates of legal system analyses, including a Judicial Reform Index &amp; a Legal Profession Reform Index.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 3pt"><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-style: italic">Systems for Enforcing</span><span style="COLOR: black"> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">Agreements and Decisions</span> (</span></strong><span style="COLOR: black">SEAD):</span> The overarching goal of this program is to improve the rule of law foundational structures that<span style="COLOR: black"> provide the basis for increased foreign and domestic economic investment and generally lead to an improved business-friendly environment. </span>There are three objectives for this program: (1) support local institutions to improve the means and mechanisms for the enforcement of obligations and contracts; (2) support local institutions to improve the means and mechanisms for the enforcement of judgments; and (3) develop and implement an appropriate and effective alternative dispute resolution system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Business Enabling Environment Program (BEEP</strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">): is a new program, managed under the Economic Growth Office, to support private sector development through improving the business environment in Kosovo. The main objectives of the program are: 1) improve rules and regulations; 2) lower trade barriers; 3) a more efficient financial sector and 4) more transparent tenders. Success in BEEP depends critically on improving the efficiency and independence of the court system which is currently tasked with resolving most commercial disputes. Similarly, reforms in the rules and regulations governing businesses can have a significant impact on the operations of the judicial system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore this project will be managed in close coordination with SEAD and other ROL programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Other USG<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Programs:</strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The State Department's Public Diplomacy Office provides grants to NGOs to support demand, access, and responsiveness by the justice sector. The U.S. Department of Justice (through OPDAT and ICITAP) provides training to the prosecutor service, assistance to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, support to border police, and assistance to the Kosovo Police Service<strong>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>It is also supporting the creation of community public safety forums.<strong> </strong>The USG also provides funding to staff and support EULEX and the IJPC.<strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">All ROL activities are coordinated in a Rule of Law Working Group chaired by the Deputy Chief of Mission.</span></p>
<p>USAID works closely with the donor community and is a member of the ROL Working Group under the EU Member State Plus Coordinating Body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It works closely with ECLO as a member of the IJPC Steering Committee; with ICO and ECLO on legislation, and with the Swiss Development Corporation on the selection of notaries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>The Pacific Region Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) Region 12 announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Surgical Prep Clippers W/Single Use Blades.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the regions based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a clinically preferred product and source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program. As a clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical criteria <BR>plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Selection will be based clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade-off criteria.<BR><BR>The major Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Pacific Region, TRBO Region 12 area include but are not limited to Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, MEDDAC-K Seoul, 374th Medical Group Yokota Air Base, 18th Medical Group Kadena Air Base. <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program, Cardinal Health. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three one-year (12 months) option periods. Anticipated selection date is July 2010.  Products and vendors that pass the technical criteria and pass the clinical performance expectations will be considered clinically preferred products and sources.  Among these clinically preferred products and sources price will be the determining factor for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF clinical preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Mary Summers, TRBO Technical Director <BR>808-433-3686, mary.summers1@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking to conduct Vendor Demonstrations pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10: Market Research. Full requirements will not be provided. No solicitation will be issued. <br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is intended to provide the USCG with follow-on Market Research. Please reference RFI HSCG23-09-I-2DW265 posted at: <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> open to the public for response from 28 May 2009 to 19 June 2009. <br /><br />The Coast Guard Logistics Information Management System (CG-LIMS) Acquisition Project will require a centrally managed, integrated, enterprise-wide logistics information management system to support USCG assets and their associated systems and equipment. This system will serve as the enterprise logistical support tool for aircraft, cutters, boats, C4ISR systems, and shore facilities. The USCG objective is to acquire a logistics system that will leverage industry standards and best practices to increase efficiency, optimize effectiveness, and establish common processes for managing logistics across the enterprise. The ability to maximize operational capabilities and minimize lifecycle costs are fundamental goals. CG-LIMS must be interoperable with legacy USCG and other government agencies' systems. CG-LIMS will be a feeder system to the Coast Guard's core accounting system. CG-LIMS will interface with existing and future USCG systems as they are transformed and modernized. As such, the system will need to be Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) compliant, and be scalable and flexible in meeting existing and future requirements.<br /><br />CG-LIMS software solution will use state-of-the-market, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) tool(s) configured to meet the USCG's business requirements.<br /><br />The Coast Guard expects to acquire a system, including planning, integration, configuration, data migration, initial user training, and deployment in one solicitation. Coast Guard does not plan to solicit proposals for the COTS software selection and then the implementation services separately.<br /><br />CG-LIMS will function on the Coast Guard Data Network (CGDN+), with potential migration to DHS OneNet. It will be compatible with the USCG SOA and Enterprise Architecture (EA).

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood City, CA 94063.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The Discovery, Early Detection, Evaluation, Treatment and Prevention in Cancer Research at Penn State have a requirement to renew and upgrade its license for Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IP A) software. The IP A software program allows researchers to access information available from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base, a database of genes, proteins, cells, etc. The Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software has the following salient characteristics:<BR>" Accesses the Ingenuity Knowledge Base data<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Ingenuity Systems produces several proprietary medical and biological data systems. The Ingenuity Pathways Analysis is currently in use by the Discovery, Early Detection, Evaluation, Treatment and Prevention in Cancer Research study. The Ingenuity software is the only one capable of accessing the Ingenuity Knowledge Base a repository of medical and biological facts and data. If the license for the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software is not renewed the workflow of the study will be interrupted. Using new medical and biological data system<BR>software would also cause delay as researchers will need to train in the use of the new system. Renewing and upgrading the license will allow the study to move forward unimpeded and will allow more researches to access the data this software allows. <BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>A search was conducted between 31 March and 6 April 2010 using Internet search engines, the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) database, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) Dynamic Small Business Search. The CCR and SBA search referenced NAICS code 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services and keywords biological, DNA and cell lines. The SBA Dynamic Small Business Search returned small businesses associated with both the NAICS 541511 and the relevant keywords. The vendors found during the search could not provide software capable of accessing the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Internet research found that the software that best meet the salient characteristics of system is available from a single vendor. The Discovery, Early Detection, Evaluation, Treatment and Prevention in Cancer Research currently use the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software as a part of their research study. The Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software sold by Ingenuity can best meet the requirements.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>None<BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>The Discovery, Early Detection, Evaluation, Treatment and Prevention in Cancer Research at Penn State are currently using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software. The only vendor that can provide the software license renewal and upgrade is Ingenuity Systems. There software fulfills the requirements set forth by the principal investigators. Other medical and biological database systems are proprietary to the manufacturers that produce them and often do not work with the systems developed by other manufacturers. There does not appear to be any actions that this agency can take to remove or overcome barriers to competition.<BR><BR>6.

The Government will utilize the information provided for planning purposes only related to the Technical Data Package (TDP) and a future acquisition strategy for this item.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center, is interested in obtaining industry input on a recently closed solicitation and the associated TDP.  A full & open competition Request for Proposal W52P1J-10-R-0053 closed on 6 April 2010 and no proposals were received by the Government for the solicited item:<BR><BR>DODIC: M670, NSN: 1375-00-028-5246, Fuse, Blasting Time: M700. The fuse is used in military demolitions to ignite nonelectric blasting caps.  The burning rate of the fuse permits the operator to ignite the fuse and reach cover before detonation.  The fuse is similar to and interchangeable with standard safety fuse.  The fuse consists of a continuous delay of black powder, tightly wrapped and enclosed by an inner cover of jute yarn conterwound with cotton yarn, and covered by a thin cover of bitumen which in turn is covered on the outside by an extruded plastic sheath.  The fuse is olive drab with a yellow single band  inches wide every 18 inches and a double yellow band every 90 inches.  The burning rate is 36 to 44 seconds per foot. <BR><BR>The solicitation for a firm fixed price, five year, indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) Contract, was to be evaluated on a best value basis.  A resultant contract would have been on F.O.B. Destination basis with a guaranteed minimum quantity of 200,000 FT.<BR><BR>The RFP included Technical Data Package Listing (TDPL) MIL-F-45144:19200 with revisions in effect as of 20 July 2009, and the engineering exceptions cited in Section C of the solicitation.  This updated TDPL included updated testing requirements and new MIL-DTL specification, among other changes and updates.  The Government is very interested in obtaining industry input on the updated TDPL.  Specifically, certain TDP requirements that precluded your firm from providing a proposal for the solicitation; and any alternate materials, construction methods, testing methods, etc. that would enable you to meet TDP requirements and give your firm interest in a further RFP.  For companies that would have been interested in this solicitation if TDP exceptions were considered, it is requested that you provide specific TDP requirements you were unwilling or unable to meet, along with the specific reasons and justification for each.  For each TDP requirement to which you cite an exception, it is also requested that you provide any suggested or proposed alternates to the requirements, along with previous manufacturing history or other supporting data to demonstrate the acceptability and effectiveness of suggested alternates/changes.  Please note that any changes impacting form, fit, and function will not be considered.    <BR>  <BR>Any previously or potentially interested companies should respond by providing the government the specific information requested above, along with the following: any other changes or re-structuring of the solicitation that would allow your firm to provide a proposal, along with the justification and specific reasons for each, a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it related to the above criteria) and availability.  Interested companies should provide minimum and maximum production capacity of the item (and if manufacturing resources are shared with other item/production lines).  Additionally, it is requested you provide the Minimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) required for economical production.  <BR><BR>Interested parties have 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information related to the recently closed M700 solicitation.

<DESC>Description: The Fort Hood Directorate of Contracting intends to enter into a non-competitive interim contract with the incumbent contractor, WIMSCO Inc., 1301 S. Treadaway, Abilene, TX 79602 for the period of 1 May 2010  30 June 2010.  The incumbent is a small business under NAICS 561730, Landscaping Services (Small Business Size Standard is $7M).  The contract action calls for the contractor to provide all resources and management necessary to perform Grounds Maintenance services at Fort Hood, Texas. The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order.  The current contract expires on 30 April 2010 and the service is critical to sustainment of performance during the procurement of the follow-on contract action.  Award of this interim contract to another contractor would entail a significant effort to phase-in, and acclimate to the Fort Hood optempo for this brief period.  It is therefore determined that there is good likelihood that a new contractor would suffer undue risk attempting to manage phase in and provide continued high level contract support, making the attempt costly and inefficient for all parties.  Firms are requested to submit any questions/concerns regarding this non-competitive interim contract directly to the contract specialist at e-mail address: Debbie.eanes@us.army.mil and copy furnish the contracting officer at email address: leeann.burke@us.army.mil no later than 26 April 2010 at 1:00 p.m. CDT.

<DESC>Contract No. 70181AM124
TAS 14 1161 100
US Department of the Interior Sole Source Justification 
1) Briefly, a description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs and include the estimated value.
Temporary lodging/office in Gambell, Alaska.  Costs are estimated at $4,350.00 for the time period of April 27, 2010 - May 27, 2010.
2) Statutory Authority  permitting other than full and open competition.  Identify the statutory authority permitting with the FAR citation and FAR citation Title.  
FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
3) WHY are the proposed contractor's unique qualifications for the nature of the acquisition requiring the use of the authority cited in item (2). 
* Gambell, at the northwest corner of St. Lawrence Island, is a small village of approximate 300 people and it has very limited quantities of services. * Sivuqaq Incorporated is the only lodge available in the city of Gambell, Alaska. 
4) WHAT effort was made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practical.  Marine Mammals Management and CGS determined that no other vendor was qualified to conduct the work due to the following factors:* CGS called the Travel Management Center, Carlson Travel.  Carlson was only able to provide one contact for lodging, Gambell Lodge.  The number provided is no longer in service.  * CGS conducted numerous searches in the Internet and GSA e-Library, no matches were found as per request.
5) A Description of the Market survey conducted and the results. 
There is not a pool of professional lodging service; there is even a limited pool of community services available in the city of Gambell, Alaska.  Market surveys were conducted at this time, strictly for long stay lodging services identification work.  
Sivuqaq Incorporated is the former expert on providing this service in this remote location.  In addition, their familiarity with the Marine Mammals Management team makes them uniquely qualified to meet the needs and services being requested for this project.  Sivuqaq willingness to accommodate Marine Mammals personnel way below the per diem lodging rate was also considered in the decision to have them conduct this work.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to the Northrop GrummanSpace and Mission Systems contract pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One ResponsibleSource, in support of Goddard Space Flight Centers (GSFC) Independent Verification andValidation (IV&V) Program.  The NASA IV&V Programs mission is to provide independentsoftware assurance to the agency, using systems engineering and software engineeringanalyses, on the safety critical and mission critical functions of selected NASA (andothers) missions.  This procurement is to extend Contract NNG05CB17C for an additionalperiod not to exceed 18 months, comprised of a base extension of 12 months and two3-month option periods.  No increase will be made to the IDIQ maximum ordering value. Due to changes made to the IV&V program, the period of performance for this award isnecessary to allow additional time while technical requirements are being finalized anduntil the competitive follow-on contract is awarded.  This extension will allow for acontinuation of current task orders issued, for modifications to existing task orders,and for new work until the IV&V competitive follow-on contract is in place.  The contractextension is necessary in order to ensure program continuity and critical mission supportand to avoid significant technical impacts to the IV&V program.  An interruption andrestart of this effort, with a new contractor that is unfamiliar with the specificrequirements of NASAs IV&V program, would greatly jeopardize the success of NASAs IV&Vmission.  Therefore, an extension of the current contract to allow for incorporation ofthese key scope decisions into the development of the re-competition strategy representsthe only practical alternative.  Northrop Grumman, as the current incumbent, has thecombined training, experience, and expertise to provide uninterrupted continuation ofmission critical support.  Due to the time and substantial duplication of costs involvedin procuring and phasing in another contractor, Northrop Grumman is considered the onlycontractor that can meet GSFCs needs given the short period of performance for theextension.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications toperform the effort in writing, via e-mail, to the identified point of contact not laterthan 4:30 PM EDT on May 4, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable inresponse to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall beconsidered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to L-3 Services, Inc.contract pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support ofGoddard Space Flight Centers (GSFC) Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V)Program.  The NASA IV&V Programs mission is to provide independent software assurance tothe agency, using systems engineering and software engineering analyses, on the safetycritical and mission critical functions of selected NASA (and others) missions.  Thisprocurement is to extend Contract NNG05CB16C for an additional period not to exceed 18months, comprised of a base extension of 12 months and two 3-month option periods.  Noincrease will be made to the IDIQ maximum ordering value.  Due to changes made to theIV&V program, the period of performance for this award is necessary to allow additionaltime while technical requirements are being finalized and until the competitive follow-oncontract is awarded.  This extension will allow for a continuation of current task ordersissued, for modifications to existing task orders, and for new work until the IV&Vcompetitive follow-on contract is in place.  The contract extension is necessary in orderto ensure program continuity and critical mission support and to avoid significanttechnical impacts to the IV&V program.	An interruption and restart of this effort, witha new contractor that is unfamiliar with the specific requirements of NASAs IV&Vprogram, would greatly jeopardize the success of NASAs IV&V mission.  Therefore, anextension of the current contract to allow for incorporation of these key scope decisionsinto the development of the re-competition strategy represents the only practicalalternative.  L-3 Services, Inc., as the current incumbent, has the combined training,experience, and expertise to provide uninterrupted continuation of mission criticalsupport.  Due to the time and substantial duplication of costs involved in procuring andphasing in another contractor, L-3 Services, Inc. is considered the only contractor thatcan meet GSFCs needs given the short period of performance for the extension.  Interestedorganizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort inwriting, via e-mail, to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 PM EDT on May4, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose ofdetermining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	Adetermination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  AnOmbudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The government intends to solicit a proposal and enter into a contract with KEEN, RICHARD A 34296 GAP RD,  GOLDEN, CO 80403-8632, a small business to provide a climate change analysis for the Central Alaska Network (CAKN) area of parks at Denali National Park, AK 99755.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please-mail contract specialist, Jordan Gunn with responses or questions regarding this requirement at jordan_gunn@nps.gov.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPENCOMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
BACKGROUND:  In 2004, the NPS Central Alaska Inventory and Monitoring Network (CAKN) contracted with Dr. Richard Keen to complete a climate data analysis for the network (P9836040056). The analysis and report were completed and received by the NPS. It has been five years since the last update and the CAKN network would now like to contract with Dr. Keen to update the analysis and also include new data from climate stations deployed in the parks since 2004. 1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements: Per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Dr. Richard A. Keen, 34296 Gap Road Golden, CO 80400 is the only available source able to complete this work because if another vendor was awarded this contract there would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. To ensure consistency and continuity, and given that the inventory of weather stations and original analysis was completed by Dr. Keen, it is in the best interest of the government to award a follow-on contract to complete this analysis update. 		2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: Update on analysis of long-term station data, including the correlations with large-scale atmospheric and oceanic climate patterns and indices, and an analysis of five years of data (2004-2009) from 16 new CAKN climate stations, including an analysis of paired high and low elevation stations.  
3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):  CAKN is interested in getting an update of the analysis Dr. Keen originally completed. Dr. Keen has all of the data and files to do an update and would be able to perform the requested update with no additional cost for evaluating the work that has been done.  The delivery schedule will provide CAKN managers with the information they need in less than a year, other contractors would most likely need longer to review the preliminary work done by Dr. Keen in order to begin the analysis. 
4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  Due to the facts stated above a market survey is not required.
5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: A contract with Dr. Keen was initiated 2004(P9836040056). This is in support of the CAKN climate program initiated in 2002 as part of the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program.  The objectives of the CAKN climate monitoring program are to monitor and record weather conditions at representative locations in order to quantify one of the drivers in Alaskan ecosystems, identify long and short-term trends, provide reliable climate data to other researchers, and to participate in larger scale climate monitoring and modeling efforts. 
6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers for competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  N/A

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in Orlando, FL intends to extend the ordering period and realign the ceiling on contract&nbsp;N00421-00-D-0328 with General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc. (GDIT). This extension is necessary due to unanticipated and substantial changes to the requirement. The additional time is necessary to define the requirement, conduct sufficient market research and allow for uninterrupted performance until a follow-on contract can be awarded. This contract is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Provisions for logistics and other support services in support of the Maintenance Planning &amp; Design Interface Department. The current ordering period will expire on 20 September 2010. This extension will cover a period of 5 months until the follow on contract is awarded in&nbsp;December 2010, with a two (2) month mobilization period. Therefore, the requirement being synopsized here is a 5 month requirement. This sole source action is being requested in order for the In-Service Support Center (ISSC) to have uninterrupted services until the recompeted contract is awarded.
<p>Any firms believing they can provide these services may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice. It must clearly show the firm's ability to be responsive without compromising the quality, accuracy or reliability of the services provided and without causing an interruption of critical services. The firm's response should also illustrate how it can overcome the start-up costs necessary to assume this effort in the short period of performance that this synopsis represents.</p>
<p>The contract was originally solicited as an unrestricted competitive procurement action. The NAICS Code is 541330 and the FSC/PSC Code is R706.</p>
<p>If firms are interested in the follow-on effort, an additional Sources Sought is anticipated to be released in May 2010 reflecting the changes made to the requirement. Send inquiries to: rebecca.woods1@navy.mil (Preferred Method) OR by mail to: NAWCTSD Attn: Ms. Rebecca Woods, Code 25332, Orlando, FL 32826, OR Fax to: 407-380-4164.</p>

Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) is a national Indian community college operated by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  SIPI was founded in 1971 with the goal of providing post-secondary education opportunities for American Indians and Alaska Natives from federally recognized tribes from throughout the United States.  Instructional offerings include a two-year transfer programs, one and two-year career and technical education programs, short course occupational programs, adult basic education, and a high school diploma program.  Classes are offered on the Albuquerque campus and at various tribal distance learning sites.  SIPI was designated a Land Grant Institution in 1994.  Land Grant status facilitates the development of food and agriculture science programs involving teaching, community outreach, and research. SIPI's student body is comprised of American Indian students from across the country; students generally are 18 years-old and older, although 17 year olds are sometimes admitted.  The average annual enrollment is 800-900 students with over 100 American Indian and Alaskan Native tribes represented. In 2000, SIPI was granted a 10 year accreditation status (2000-2010) by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.  On December 7-9, 2009, SIPI completed a 10 year comprehensive site visit to reaffirm its accreditation status. A team representing the HLC conducted the site evaluation.  In preparation, of the visit, over a year and a half, SIPI engaged in a process of self-study, addressing the Commissions requirements and 5 criteria for accreditation.Services in audit review for accreditation are required so that SIPI can maintain accreditation status.  Accreditation has two fundamental purposes: quality assurance and program improvement.  Institutional accreditation evaluates an entire institution and accredits it as a whole.   It assesses formal educational activities and also evaluates governance and administration, financial stability, admissions and student personnel services, resources, student academic achievement, organizational effectiveness, and relationships with outside constituencies.  The Commission accredits approximately 1100 institutions of higher education in a nineteen state region.  The Commission is recognized by the U.S Department of Education. As a federal college that is funded and operated by the Department of Interior, it is difficult to take the day to day operational information and formulate into standard accounting reports.  The Department of Interior and BIA/BIE have standard audits, but they do not contain detailed information about SIPI.  From the recent visit it has become apparent that the college will need to develop its own stand alone audit / financial reporting process to meet the reporting requirements of the HLC. 
Scope.  This project will consist of a review of current financial information and procedures for SIPI, a review of reporting requirements for HLC accreditation, and the development of a process that uses information captured in SIPI's financial database and reorganizes it into a financial statement format that HLC can use to compare SIPI with other institutions of higher learning and complies with all federal regulations. The vendor must ensure that all recommendations and reporting requirements are documented to sufficiently comply with all relevant guidance including, but not limited to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and HLC fiscal reporting requirements.
Objectives.  The overall objective for this project is to develop an understanding of the identified weakness in the financial reporting to the HLC and develop and assist in the implementation of new procedures required to correct the weakness. The four main objectives will be to:a.  Determine areas of fiscal reporting deficiency relative to HLC accreditation reporting requirements.b.  Review SIPI fiscal information and FFS capabilities with respect to information requirements for HLC accreditation.c.  Develop and report recommendations for an annual process to close the documented reporting gaps.d.  Work with SIPI personnel to develop a comprehensive report through the  implementation of the new reporting process.
Tasks.  The Contractor shall develop an understanding of the identified weakness in the financial reporting to the HLC and the processes and procedures required to correct the weakness.
The Contractor will assess SIPI's core financial management system (FFS) to determine the reporting gaps and issues that exist between those mandated by the HLC and the information available. This assessment needs to consider the HLC information reporting requirements, audit standards, statutory requirements, and the agency's enterprise financial management system and business processes.
The Contractor will develop a thorough understanding of the qualifications and responsibilities of SIPI personnel responsible for financial information.
The Contractor shall assist in establishing the reporting structure, roles and responsibilities, and training, and will assist SIPI finance and accounting personnel to implement the recommendations developed as part of this project.
SIPI anticipates the possible need for follow up support and assistance in implementing the recommendations developed as a part of this project. Follow up Ad Hoc support will be authorized on an hourly basis, not to exceed the total amount of hours authorized. When an Ad Hoc support requirement is identified, SIPI will request that the contractor provide an estimate of number of hours required by the senior level accountant to perform the effort.
The contractor has no authority to incur material costs without the explicit prior written approval of the contracting officer.
Deliverables.  All deliverables shall conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
The vendor will provide an "Overview Report" on the budget and finance processes for the college and how they apply to the HLC reporting requirements. This report will also detail those areas of the HLC reporting requirements that are not applicable to the federal college and will highlight any information that, if compared with other institutions of higher learning, would provide inconclusive results due to SIPI's organization as a federal entity.
The vendor will provide a "Recommendations Report" that will outline recommendations to bridge the gap between the financial systems of the federal government and the reporting requirements for accreditation.  These recommendations may, to the extent feasible, offer alternatives to HLC requirements that would enable HLC to compare SIPI to other institutions of higher learning. 
Using the process and procedures developed in the Recommendations Report, the vendor will provide a fiscal report / audit detailing specific information and financial ratios that are required by the Higher Learning Commission in the evaluation and accreditation process.  
All reports shall: a.  Clearly describe issues, applicable criteria, findings, conclusions, and recommendations. b.  Include sufficient detail to convince a general audience of the validity and significance of the facts, conclusions, and recommendations. c.  Contain an index linking each major issue to supporting items, discussions and information / data. 
After delivery and receipt by SIPI, there will be a two-week (14-day) period for review and acceptance of each deliverable by SIPI.
Government Furnished Property.  SIPI will accommodate the needs of the contractor to hold meetings and other engagement as best as possible. When work is required onsite, the contractor and employees will be furnished with office space, office phone, office supplies, computers and printers, and access to copy and fax machines. Other than mutually agreed upon facilities, there will not be any Government Furnished Property or Facilities available for use in performance of this project.

Place of Performance.  The contractor will work both on and off the Albuquerque SIPI campus; contractor will gather and review data and information from faculty, staff and programs; as well as perform interviews of current and former employees through telephone phone or on/off campus. Other mutually agreed upon events may be held at other designated locations agreed upon between the contractor and SIPI President. 
Period of Performance.  The project should begin in April 27, 2010 and conclude by July 31, 2010. 
Qualification of Expert Provider:  a.  This contract shall be contingent upon acceptance of lead personnel by SIPI and such personnel shall be expected to remain in place for the duration of the contract.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation issued for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Methods, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with FAR 13.106(b) Single Source Brand Name Requirement purchase descriptions.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a firm fixed price quotation is requested and a formal written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is NAMA-10-Q-0038 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39 effective March 19, 2010.  This is a Full and Open solicitation under NAICS 811212 with a size standard of $25 millions of dollars.  The Government reserves the right to issue an order based on initial quotations without discussions. Evaluation and order issuance will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation.  An order will be issued to the vendor whose submitted quotation completely conforms to the posted RFQ and its requirements and will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this order will be evaluated based on a lowest priced technically acceptable evaluation.  BACKGROUND:  The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requires B&#336;WE BELL + HOWELL as well as KODAK brand name certified scanner maintenance service for the period of May 1, 2010 to April 30, 2011. The government prefers base plus option year pricing but a quote with only base year will be considered. It is imperative for NARA to purchase B&#336;WE BELL + HOWELL as well as KODAK brand certified service because of the proprietary nature specialized systems and the lack of compatibility among competing products which is designed by the commercial industry as a way to protect corporate profits and preclude pirating of proprietary data and code.  In an effort to maximize competition while maintaining the integrity of NARA's IT environment, the requirement will be posted on FedBizOpps under full and open competition notwithstanding the brand name requirement.  REQUIREMENTS:  This is a Brand Name, firm-fixed price RFQ and all delivery costs must be included in the total firm-fixed price quote.  NARA requires brand certified service because of the proprietary nature of specialized systems and the lack of compatibility among competing products which is designed by the commercial industry as a way to protect corporate profits and preclude pirating of proprietary data and code.  This is a request for quote and quotations furnished are not offers.  This request does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in the preparations of the submission of this quotation or to contract for supplies or services.  Any representations and/or certifications attached to this request for quotation must be completed by the Vendor.
CLINS:

As allowed by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1), the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive, and represents the best value to the Government based on selection of the technically acceptable quotation with the lowest evaluated price. The best value is represented by the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required.

Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

Past Performance <br />Award will be made to the offer proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, delivery, and past performance. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).</p>
<p>(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required. <br />(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision) <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.35 per hour or $134.00 per week or $580.66 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p><br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />The purpose of the discussion below is to advise contractors which are subject to the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act or the Service Contract<br />Act of the principal provisions of these acts.<br />Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act<br />General Provisions - This act applies to contracts which exceed or may exceed $10,000 entered into by any agency or instrumentality<br />of the United States for the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment. The act establishes minimum wage, maximum<br />hours, and safety and health standards for work on such contracts, and prohibits the employment on contract work of convict labor (unless certain<br />conditions are met) and children under 16 years of age. The employment of homeworkers (except homeworkers with disabilities employed under<br />the provisions of Regulations, 29 CFR Part 525) on a covered contract is not permitted.<br />In addition to its coverage of prime contractors, the act under certain circumstances applies to secondary contractors performing work under<br />contracts awarded by the Government prime contractor.<br />All provisions of the act except the safety and health requirements are administered by the Wage and Hour Division.<br />Minimum Wage - Covered employees must currently be paid not less than the Federal minimum wage established in section 6(a)(1) of<br />the Fair Labor Standards Act.<br />Overtime - Covered workers must be paid at least one and one-half times their basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 a<br />week. Overtime is due on the basis of the total hours spent in all work, Government and non-Government, performed by the employee in any<br />week in which covered work is performed.<br />Child Labor - Employers may protect themselves against unintentional child labor violations by obtaining certificates of age. State employment<br />or age certificates are acceptable.<br />Safety and Health - No covered work may be performed in plants, factories, buildings, or surroundings or under work conditions that<br />are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health and safety of the employees engaged in the performance of the contract. The safety and<br />health provisions of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act are administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<br />Posting - During the period that covered work is being performed on a contract subject to the act, the contractor must post copies of Notice<br />to Employees Working on Government Contracts in a sufficient number of places to permit employees to observe a copy on the way to or from<br />their place of employment.<br />Responsibility for Secondary Contractors - Prime contractors are liable for violations of the act committed by their covered<br />secondary contractors.<br />Service Contract Act<br />General Provisions - The Service Contract Act applies to every contract entered into by the United States or the District of Columbia,<br />the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees. Contractors and subcontractors<br />performing on such Federal contracts must observe minimum wage and safety and health standards, and must maintain certain records, unless<br />a specific exemption applies.<br />Wages and Fringe Benefits - Every service employee performing any of the Government contract work under a service contract<br />in excess of $2,500 must be paid not less than the monetary wages, and must be furnished the fringe benefits, which the Secretary of Labor has<br />determined to be prevailing in the locality for the classification in which the employee is working or the wage rates and fringe benefits (including<br />any accrued or prospective wage rates and fringe benefits) contained in a predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement. The wage<br />rates and fringe benefits required are usually specified in the contract but in no case may employees doing work necessary for the performance<br />of the contract be paid less than the minimum wage established in section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.<br />Service contracts which do not exceed $2,500 are not subject to prevailing rate determinations or to the safety and health requirements of the<br />act. However, the act does require that employees performing work on such contracts be paid not less than the minimum wage rate established<br />in section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.<br />Overtime - The Fair Labor Standards Act and the Contract Work Hours Safety Standards Act may require the payment of overtime at time<br />and one-half the regular rate of pay for all hours work on the contract in excess of 40 a week. The Contract Work Hours Safety Standards Act<br />is more limited in scope than the Fair Labor Standards Act and generally applies to Government contracts in excess of $100,000 that require or<br />involve the employment of laborers, mechanics, guards, watchmen.<br />Safety and Health - The act provides that no part of the services in contracts in excess of $2,500 may be performed in buildings or<br />surroundings or under working conditions, provided by or under the control or supervision of the contractor or subcontractor, which are unsanitary<br />or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees engaged to furnish the services. The safety and health provisions of the<br />Service Contract Act are administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<br />Notice to Employees - On the date a service employee commences work on a contract in excess of $2,500, the contractor (or subcontractor)<br />must provide the employee with a notice of the compensation required by the act. The posting of the notice (including any applicable<br />wage determination) contained on the reverse in a location where it may be seen by all employees performing on the contract will satisfy this<br />requirement.<br />Notice in Subcontracts - The contractor is required to insert in all subcontracts the labor standards clauses specified by the regulations<br />in 29 CFR Part 4 for Federal service contracts exceeding $2,500.<br />Responsibility for Secondary Contractors - Prime contractors are liable for violations of the act committed by their covered<br />secondary contractors.<br />Other Obligations - Observance of the labor standards of these acts does not relieve the employer of any obligation he may have under<br />any other laws or agreements providing for higher labor standards.<br />Additional Information - Additional Information and copies of the acts and applicable regulations and interpretations may be obtained<br />from the nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division or the National Office in Washington D.C. Information pertaining to safety and health standards<br />may be obtained from the nearest office of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the National Office in Washington, D.C.<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />Employment Standards Administration<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE: 1996 - 421-004/59075<br />Washington, D.C. 20210</p>

<DESC>The following are responses to questions received in regard to the solicitation.<BR><BR>Question:  Does the camera which appears to be provided by one supplier need to be a integrated infrared dome or can a compilation of '5MP D/N w/outdoor housing and separate IR illuminator' be used to accomplish the same objective?<BR>Response:  The system should be integrated and not a compilation.  That is because we desire that each piece of hardware is capable of supporting the mission in its own parameter without having to rely on other devices.  It is our desire to reduce the amount fail-points on this application. We need to be able to pin point a problem with out having multiple systems or components to overlook and if there was a problem be able to get the system back up and running as fast as possible. Furthermore, compiled systems generally reveal underlying problems that arise as different system components (although they have been proven to be technically compliant) will still have hiccups in interfaced connectivity. <BR><BR>Question:  Is it necessary for the exterior cameras to be powered by POE?<BR>Response:  Yes, it will be required at all Megapixel cameras be Power over Ethernet (POE).<BR><BR>Question:  If so, can the housing Heater/Blower if necessary be powered by a separate Low Voltage Centralized source and the camera on POE? <BR>Response:  All associated camera power for infrared/camera and heater/blower must be Power over Ethernet (POE).  Again, it goes without saying that we would like to achieve our goal with one integrated solution as it includes power.  The fewer design mechanisms that go into this installation, the more simple the long-term upkeep maintenance and lower service costs.<BR><BR>Question:  Can the motion detection zones be accommodated by the NVR solution instead of the camera?<BR>Response:  All Megapixel cameras must also contain built in motion detection and not just the Network Video Recorder (NVR).<BR><BR>Question:  What is the desired size for the 3 requested monitors ? <BR>Response:  All monitors should be a minimum of 21 and be rated for high definition 1080. Each qualified contractors Master Certified Electronics Technician will have the technical ability to effectively integrate the 16 CCTV channels and Graphical user Interface (GUI) to our desire on site.<BR><BR>Question:  5TB is specified, is there a desired frame rate and archiving duration?<BR>Response:  The 16 Channel Network Video Recorder (NVR) will be supplied with a 5TB hard disk.  The frame rate must be capable to record at least 10 Frames Per Second (FPS) consistently per camera and provide a minimum of 30 days storage.  The Master CET will optimize the system for performance around this minimum baseline.  We gladly welcome increased capability of hardware but require that least 10 Frames Per Second (FPS) be provided.  This minimum requirement is quite standard, industry wide.<BR><BR>End of Question & Answers.<BR><BR>Please be aware that no extension will be made as of this amendment and the previously stated deadline of 20 April 2010 1:00PM MST is still in effect.

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.</p>
<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(b)(2). The continued work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order and was competed and awarded in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not issued under sole source or limited source procedures. The contractor shall continue to provide Strategic Deterrence and Global Strike Planning Support for USSTRATCOM/J52. The primary objective of this task order is for the contractor to provide Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) to assist J52 in the maintenance and revision of USSTRATCOM's Strategic Deterrence and Global Strike (SDGS) Operational Plan (OPLAN) effort. Contractor support is sought to bring a synchronized approach to assist with the USSTRATCOM SDGS OPLAN by properly revising, maintaining and planning, implementing, and managing, the efforts of this requirement. The contractor shall support all planning, implementation, coordination, and analysis of the mission to meet the requirements of the Performance Work Statement. A Top Secret clearance with eligibility for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), Nuclear Command and Control, Extremely Sensitive Information (NC2/ESI), and Crypto access is required for contractor personnel involved with operational plans, and with network and emergency actions procedures related to this task.</p>
<p>The follow-on effort's source selection will not be completed by 30 April 10, the end date of the current period of performance. Therefore, the Government intends to extend the current task order for one month (1 May 10 through 31 May 10) to allow time for completion of the follow-on source selection.</p>
<p>This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal nor a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement is based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>If your company has the capability to provide Strategic Deterrence and Global Strike Planning Support services at full performance starting 1 May 10 through 31 May 10 (one month), provide a capability package to the Contracting Officer and a copy to the Contract Specialist by the response date, 23 April 10.</p>

<p>88 CONS/PKBB, ATTN: Mr. Brian J. Long<br />1940 Allbrook Drive, Room 109<br />Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5309</p>
<p>Please include in all correspondence a reference to ""FA8601-10-T-0180, Laboratory Services for Coal Analysis".</p>
<p>EXISTING CONTRACT INFORMATION: Laboratory Services for Coal Analysis are currently performed under contract FA8601-08-P-0045, which expires 30 November, 2010. The incumbent contractor is Wyoming Analytical Labratories, Inc. CAGE Code 302Q2. The estimated value of the current 3-year contract (including its base period and 2 option periods $40,000.00 The SIC and NAICS codes are 8734 and 541380, respectively.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>Below is a description of the issues that are believed to be of the greatest importance in the solicitation of Laboratory Services for Coal Analysis.</p>
<p>a. Does the contract laboratory have the capabilities to perform coal analysis on a regular basis? This is of greatest importance due to the requirement to grind coal to a very small size. Most laboratories prefer not to purchase the necessary equipment to pulverize coal to a size acceptable to the American Standard Testing Methods (ASTM). Additionally they prefer not to provide a special room for handling the extremely dusty work.</p>
<p>b. Does the laboratory have an internal Quality Assurance Program (QAP)? The date from the samples being analyzed is used to report emission levels under the base Air Pollution Permit. Providing quantitative as well as qualitative results is extremely important. Since EPA does not require any type of licensing or permitting for laboratory analysis relating to coal, it is the responsibility of the customer to ensure they are incorporating the necessary QAP protocols.</p>
<p>c. Does the contract laboratory have the capabilities to use the ASTM procedures listed in the Performance Work Statement? There are several different methods for analysis that can be used for coal. It is very important that the contract lab is capable and use those methods listed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>d. Does the contract laboratory have the capacity to handle the varying quantities of samples being submitted for analysis? Although the base only submits 4 to 6 samples a month it is important that they are able to analyze them immediately without waiting for other customer analysis. Due to the need to report our coal analysis to the EPA on a quarterly basis, we must make sure that sample results are obtained in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<DESC>This project will be advertised on an unrestricted (full and open) basis. 

PROJECT DETAILS: The Beartooth Highway in Wyoming begins at the Wyoming/Montana State Line east of Cooke City, Montana, following US 212 for 56.1 kilometers to the Wyoming/Montana State Line southwest of Red Lodge, Montana. The project is located entirely within the Shoshone National Forest. The project begins at approximately Mile Post 26 immediately west of Beartooth Lake Outlet Bridge, and ends at approximately Mile Post 27.7 immediately west of Little Bear Creek. The project is located in remote, environmentally sensitive high alpine terrain (in excess of 9,000 feet) with a very limited construction season (4 to 5 months per year), and must be completed in 2011. Considerable attention to detail is required in project construction due the historical eligibility of the existing roadway and bridges. 

The base schedule, Schedule A, for this project consists of the removal of the existing Beartooth Lake Outlet Bridge, and reconstructing a new structure, with approaches totaling 0.4 mile, immediately adjacent to, and partially over, the existing bridge. The existing bridge can be partially used for maintenance of traffic, and is required to be deconstructed in an extremely careful manner in order to preserve the existing stone masonry for reuse on the new structure, and limit turbidity in Beartooth Creek. Schedule A will also contain the construction of a historic bridge interpretive site, parking area, and access trail, as well as reconstruction of the Beartooth Lake Campground approach road intersection. The principal work items on the base schedule include: lump sum contractor testing, lump sum construction schedule, 3,500 m3 roadway excavation, 7,700 m3 unclassified borrow, 6,000 t aggregate base, 1,350 t superpave pavement, 124 m precast, prestressed concrete girders, 46,750 kg reinforcing steel - epoxy coated, 260 m3 structural concrete, 830 m micropiles, 2 trial micropiles, 131 m of Guardrail system G3 - Wyoming box beam steel posts, along with associated traffic control and equipment/flagging, soil erosion control, survey and staking, pavement markings.

There are two optional schedules: (1) Option V  pre-grubbing removal of stumps, seeding and mulching, and erosion control, along a 1.2 mile extension of the eastern bridge approach; (2) Option W  grade, drain, and pave 1.2 miles of roadway predominately along the existing alignment east of the Beartooth Lake Campground approach intersection. 

Principal work items on Option V include: 200 hours each of Dump Truck, Bulldozer, Excavator, and Labor for stump removal, 4.0 ha seeding, 4.0 ha mulching, 2,400 m silt fence, and associated traffic control equipment/flagging, seeding, and mulching.

Principal work items on Option W include: lump sum contractor testing, lump sum construction schedule, 27,500 m3 roadway excavation, 5,100 m3 unclassified borrow, 14,000 t aggregate base, 3,650 t superpave pavement, 1,450 m asphalt curb, 450 m of guardrail system G4 (w-beam steel posts), 5.4 ha seeding, 4.6 ha mulching, along with associated traffic control and equipment/flagging, soil erosion control, survey and staking, pavement markings.

It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in early May with construction beginning in 2010 and extending up to two construction seasons.

Estimated cost for the base schedule and both options is $5 - $10 million.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE EXPECTED RELEASE DATE FOR THE RFP HAS BEEN CHANGED</span> TO APRIL 19, 2010 WITH PROPOSALS DUE AT 4PM EST ON&nbsp; June 7, 2010.</strong><br /><br /><br />This is a Presolicitation notice for the previously posted Sources Sought notice <strong>#NIHES2009073</strong> entitled <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparation of the Report on Carcinogens.<br /></span>
<p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is soliciting proposals for the purpose of providing Support for the Preparations of the Report on Carcinogens. The objective of this project is to procure assistance in preparing the Report on Carcinogens and documents used in its scientific review process. The RoC is a congressionally mandated public document that lists agents, substances, mixtures or exposure circumstances that are known or reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens. This contract shall perform tasks associated with the fulfillment of three requirement types: 1) preparation of scientific documents 2) Logistics of scientific review meetings and 3) preparation of the RoC in a desktop publishing format.</p>
<p>Preparation of Scientific Documents:<br />The Contractor shall provide support to the RoC Center for preparing multiple scientific documents with different levels of complexity based on 1) types of peer-reviewed literature cited - primary (original studies) or secondary references (reviews or peer-reviewed evaluations), 2) number of cited references, 3) writing style -"study by study" approach, that is a summary of the design, methods, results, and conclusions for individual studies, or "review" style, that is a summary of major findings across studies. All the documents shall contain information on the following topics; however, the degree of detail written on each topic will vary depending on the purpose of the document (e.g., nomination or substance review document) and the subject matter (e.g., substance under review). Topics include: 1) Introduction and description of the properties (e.g., chemical, physical or biological) of the substance 2) Human Exposure 3) Human Cancer Studies 4) Studies in Experimental Animals.</p>
<p>Logistics of scientific review meetings:<br />The Contractor shall be responsible for the logistics of convening meetings related to the scientific review of substances under consideration for possible listing or de-listing in the RoC. Duties include, but are not limited to 1) Securing a venue and equipment 2) Preparation, printing and dissemination of meeting materials for participants, government staff and the public and 3) Travel arrangements for invited participants.</p>
<p>Preparation of the RoC in a desktop publishing format:<br />For each new edition of the RoC, the Contractor shall update the carcinogenicity, production, use, exposure and regulatory sections of profiles for approximately 25 of the substances that are currently listed in the RoC. The Contractor shall provide scientific/administrative support for creating the RoC draft, which is a compilation of the new and current substance profiles and relevant tables, appendices, and indexes. This task includes updating some of the various components of the RoC, providing chemical structures for the listed chemicals, checking for technical accuracy, and copy editing. The Contractor shall prepare the preliminary draft of the RoC in desktop publishing format.</p>
<p>Mandatory Requirements</p>
<p>Geographical proximity <br />The Contractor staff (key personnel, technical and administrative)&nbsp;must be located within 30 minutes of NIEHS because of (1) frequent impromptu meetings between Contractor personnel and the Project Officer and RoC Center staff to complete work under strict deadlines, and (2) the location of the scientific review meetings which will take place (both on-site at NIEHS and at off-site venues) in the Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC vicinity. This proximity will aid in the RoC Center's continual in-person collaborative work on documents with the Contractor. Past scientific review meetings required most of the Contractor's staff and also involve several pre-meeting site visits.</p>
<p>Staff<br />The key scientific personnel&nbsp;must be employees of the Contractor and not sub-contractors or consultants. For the Key positions not filled at time of initial submissions, a letter of commitment and CV from proposed personnel should be included at the time of receipt of FPR.</p>
<p>Equipment and software<br />The Contractor&nbsp;must perform their work using a Macintosh platform and Apple computer hardware in order to eliminate cross-platform technical problems. The preparation of scientific documents requires numerous exchanges of documents, and cross-platform translation problems (such as style and font concerns, incorrect scientific symbols, misaligned data tables, and pagination errors) can affect efficiency.</p>
<p>One contract will be awarded. The anticipated period of performance is five years. The government estimate of direct labor is approximately 12,840 direct labor hours over the five year contract period. This is only an estimate of direct labor. The Government anticipates the participation of senior research professionals (i.e. Principal Investigator, Senior Scientist, technical, etc) such as toxicologists, epidemiologists, technical/scientific writers, scientific copy editors, administrative support, etc. The anticipated award date is&nbsp;December&nbsp;12, 2010. This is a requirement for a 100% total small business set-aside. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code identified for this requirement is 511130 with a size standard of 500 employees.&nbsp; All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC><p>The Navy has an immediate and urgent requirement for the T-34 at the Chief of Naval Air Training Command (CNATRA); specifically at Naval Air Station (NAS) Corpus Christi and NAS Whiting Field. This requirement encompasses bringing non-flying aircraft up to a flying status in order to recover CNATRA's lost Pilot Training Rate as a result of cracked rudder pedal assemblies and other maintenance-related issues. As part of this recovery plan, the requirement may include support for the T-44 platform. The period of performance for this effort will be approximately 6 months beginning approximately 30 April 2010. The single most important performance objective is providing airworthy aircraft to meet the daily flight schedule (DFS) to enable full flight operations. If the Navy does not procure this requirement within the required timeframe, there will be a significant negative impact on Naval Air Readiness.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to request a proposal and negotiate with L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace LLC, Madison, MS on an other than full and open competitive basis per FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with L-3 to procure their services as stated above. L-3 is the only maintenance provider aside from the incumbent that is onsite at NAS Whiting Field and NAS Corpus Christi and therefore the only company that can meet the Navy's requirement within the timeframe required. An award to any other company would result in an unacceptable delay to fulfilling the Navy's requirement.</p>
<p>Concurrently with this requirement, the Navy will conduct a full and open competition for the larger Contractor Logistics Services requirement (organizational, intermediate and depot level maintenance) for the T-34, T-44 and T-6 programs. Additional information will be available via FEDBIZOPPS within the next several weeks. For further information about the full and open competition, please contact Maryellen Lyons or Jessica McGee via e-mail at maryellen.lyons@navy.mil or jessica.mcgee@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, Maryland is publishing this request for information (RFI) for Market Research purposes only. This market survey RFI is being conducted to assist NAVAIR in understanding the currently available drawer and cabinet solutions that can serve as a warehouse storage solution and that can integrate with and augment existing supply Mobile Facilities (MF's) that serve as the deployable, expeditionary storage/warehouse solution. Scalability and flexibility are needed in order to store and transport aviation spare parts in a building block fashion as single drawers, stacks of drawers, cabinets with drawers installed, and/or as bulk storage cabinets. The desire is to be able to quickly configure this capability as a set of drawers or cabinets, a medium size container full of cabinets, a MF with drawers/cabinets installed or even multiple MF's worth of drawer/cabinet combinations. The concept is aviation spare parts storage from the warehouse, to the battlefield, and back to the warehouse in a scalable, tailorable, durable drawer/cabinet capability integrated within existing facilities.
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the governemnt to form a binding contract.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Management on the behalf of the Indian Health Service (IHS), intends to award a  contract on a  sole-source basis to Chickasaw Nation Division of Commerce, 2020 East Lonnie Abbott, Ada OK 74820 . The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2). This procurement will be awarded under Part 15 of the FAR Contracting by Negotiation.

BACKGROUND:
The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is the principal health care provider and health advocate for American Indian and Alaska Native people. The IHS provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who belong to 564 federally recognized tribes in 35 states.  The Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) is the health information system that supports the provision of patient care services at Indian Health Service and Tribally operated health care facilities across the nation.  IHS and Tribes operate some 40 hospitals that use the RPMS.  All of these facilities have Emergency Departments, Urgent Care clinics, or both.  Many outpatient facilities also have busy Urgent Care operations.  Patient and staff workflows in these settings are different than in general clinic settings; users have requested a "dashboard" capability to permit clinicians and managers to efficiently allocate available resources (rooms, providers, ancillary staff) to promote patient safety and improve flow through the system. 

PURPOSE:
The purpose of the solicitation is to acquire or develop an Emergency Department Dashboard application that will become an integrated part of the public domain IHS RPMS health information system. 

SYNOPSIS:
The requirement is to develop or acquire software that can be implemented in "plug and play" fashion at facilities running the RPMS Electronic Health Record, with no additional hardware or infrastructure beyond the standard RPMS implementation in an Intersystems Cache 2008 database environment.  The software must be able to integrate seamlessly with the current released RPMS suite, in particular with the EHR and with the RPMS Emergency Room System application, respecting RPMS user authentication.  It must be configurable as a component within the RPMS EHR or as a stand-alone application.  It must display patients awaiting check-in, as well as those checked in with all relevant data such as presenting complaints, vital signs, orders and results, and other status information, updated in real time from RPMS. Required outputs include Medication Reconciliation worksheets, laboratory specimen labels, and a variety of Emergency Department and workload reports.  The software will be integrated into the RPMS suite of applications; all work will become the property of the Government, and the contractor will retain no copyright or intellectual property rights. 

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work described above. 
Interested parties who feel that they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may identify their interest by providing clear and comprehensive information supporting their claim, inclusive of references listing contact person(s) and phone number(s). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available; therefore, requests for such documents will be considered invalid responses. However, all information received within 15 days of the publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within its discretion. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no responses are received within 15 days, the Government shall negotiate and award to the Chickasaw Nation Division of Commerce.

<DESC>This project is for replacement of the Snake River Excitation System. The excitation system provides field current for a synchronous machine, including all power, regulating, control, and protective elements. Each unit generator has a stand alone exciter. Twelve unit exciters are scheduled to be replaced: Units 1 thru 6 at Little Goose Lock and Dam, Units 4 thru 6 at Lower Monumental Lock and Dam, and Units 4 thru 6 at Lower Granite Lock and Dam.<br /><br />The contract will require the supply and installation of a digital excitation system for each of the twelve units. The excitation system includes the following; new digital exciters, molded case circuit breakers, exciter cubicles, fuse cabinets, regulator cabinets, power potential transformers, digital controls, collector ring assemblies (collector ring, brush holders, brushes and supports), and associated cabling and wires. Modifications to the existing switchboard will also be required. Additionally, the contract will require the removal, demolition and disposal of the non-rotating parts for these units, and removal of the existing excitation power, signal and control cabling, and slip rings for each existing excitation system. Concrete Patching, grouting and repair will also be required.<br /><br />The period of performance for the contract is approximately three years. The period of performance for onsite work is dependent upon the spring runoff and fish passage windows that generally provide seven to nine calendar months of on-site work access, July through March. Submittals, manufacture, delivery and site preparation outside of the allowable outage windows may start anytime after award. Project site priority and coordination with other project work windows may also dictate other construction schedule requirements and restrictions.<br /><br />Solicitation No. W912EF-10-R-0002 will be posted to the FBO website on or about May 7, 2010. Proposals will be due no sooner than 30 calendar days after actual solicitation issuance date.

The purpose of this RFI is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of vendors who can successfully support this requirement as a prime contractor and system integrator.  The contemplated type of solicitation that will be issued will depend upon the responses to this sources sought notice and other information available to the Government.  The resultant acquisition approach must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive contractors.<BR><BR>Responses must clearly demonstrate the qualifications, capability and expertise of the prime contractor or system integrator.  Responses to this notice will be used as part of the information gathered as market research that will be used to develop the acquisition strategy to satisfy this potential requirement.    <BR><BR>The Government has not formalized an acquisition strategy, there is no solicitation and there is no other information available at this time.  Other than responses to this RFI, no other responses or inquiries will be accepted.  Questions regarding the scope work of work or acquisition strategy will not be accepted at this time.  In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made.  <BR><BR>The USASMDC is conducting a Market Survey to acquire commercial surveillance and target acquisition system (the system) as well as System Integrator (SI) for these systems.  The system shall be capable of detecting hostile troop and/or equipment movement at great distances.  This capability enables U.S. forces to respond rapidly to threatening situations in both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The system is intended to minimize the vulnerability of U.S. and coalition forces and enable timely and appropriate response options (direct air attack, indirect fire, and ground patrol/attack) against Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), Vehicle-Born IEDs, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar, and small arms attacks.  The system shall operate at the unclassified level and shall be capable of providing data to classified systems without directly connecting to the classified network.  All system components must be transportable via air and ground vehicles.

All documentation shall become the property of the Government.<br /><br />*Based on some confusion, this sources sought synopsis was edited to clarify the "60-ton jack" statement.&nbsp; When asked about this issue, the customer responded with the following explanation:<br /><br />"The jacks don't weigh 60 tons; they can lift 60 tons. The weight requirement for the trailer doesn't come from the jacks; it comes from the MHU-83C/E munitions truck loaders. However, the jacks are wider than the loaders so the width requirement comes from them. Basically, we are trying to get one trailer to meet both requirements."</p>

<DESC>RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 Questions and Answers, 15 through 19.Question 15:Could you please provide clarification to the statement "It is anticipated that only contractors with current commercially available or adaptable systems will be eligible for this effort"?  Does this mean that the contractor conducting the assessment and recommendations will also be expected to provide all the work necessary to implement the recommendations or does it contemplate a second solicitation to determine appropriate contractors to implement the recommendations?Answer 15:RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 has been amended to reflect a request for information in regard to a possible assessment and recommended solution to improve the VA's Medical, Surgical and Prosthetic Advanced Supply Chain Capability.  There is no expectation that any vendor, conducting an assessment and providing a recommended solution, will carry out implementation.  Implementation of a solution would be a separate effort.*****Question 16:Do you still intend to host an industry day where we will be able to provide additional information on our capabilities?Answer 16:The market research conference for RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 has been canceled.*****Question 17:Can you indicate if the objective of the information request is gain input from solution providers related to their capabilities and systems or is it open to firms who provide assessment and implementation support to aid in the analysis of requirements, selection of a solution, and implementation of the system? Answer 17:The objective of RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 is to gain information about potential vendor's capabilities in conducting an assessment and recommending a solution to improve the VA's Medical, Surgical and Prosthetic Advanced Supply Chain Capability.*****Question 18:Finally, is there any opportunity to extend the deadline?Answer 18:The deadline for responses to RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 will not be extended at this time.  The response time and date for RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 is no later than 3:00 PM (est.) on Wednesday, April 21, 2010.*****Question 19:Can you please provide clarification on whether the more recent RFI request is looking for vendors that can perform the advisory services originally identified or a vendor that currently has their own solution to propose with their products capabilities?Answer 19:The objective of RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 is to gain information about potential vendor's capabilities in conducting an assessment and recommending a solution to improve the VA's Medical, Surgical and Prosthetic Advanced Supply Chain Capability.*****

<DESC>The Best Practices Guide for Mail Screening and Handling, will outline the most efficient and effective processes and procedures to handle and screen mail entering government facilities for biological, chemical, radiological, and explosive threats.  The objective of the research and the resulting guide will be to significantly reduce the risk of mail-borne threats to government personnel and facilities.  The guide will be developed in three phases using a combination of research approaches, including an in-depth literature review, a series of interviews and meetings with government and industry subject matter experts (SMEs), and an analysis of existing government mail processing and screening operations.  The best-practices guide will examine risks in government mail streams; technologies, facilities, and processes to combat risks; training requirements for mail center personnel; and emergency response procedures.  The guide will also include copies of key regulatory requirements, a risk matrix to help identify the appropriate handling and screening approach for a given location, and a series of short case studies to help mail center managers better understand the approaches being illustrated throughout the guide. The guidelines developed as a result of this research will have verifiable scientific underpinnings and be based on strategic engineering, economic, and regulatory analyses of the options available.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award.<br><br>The contractor shall provide a cultural immersion and undergraduate-level social studies program in China/Mongolia, Egypt, and Senegal/the Gambia in accordance with curriculum guidelines and objectives of FMSO (Curriculum guidelines are contained in section 3.4).  The program will be conducted for a group of 24 U.S. Army (ROTC) cadets, 6 U.S. Army Cadet Command Officers and up to 6 U.S. government civilian personnel for a total of up to 36 persons, with approximately 12 persons traveling to each country.  The majority of the program shall take place in and around (1) Beijing, China/Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; (2) Cairo, Egypt; and (3) Dakar, Senegal/Banjul, the Gambia, with day trips and overnight trips in each curriculum. The program will include sessions with corresponding local excursions to reinforce the curriculum, with total academic content (including lectures, language orientation, and excursions) normally expected to last 8-10 hours per day total.  The contractor will direct the program toward the needs of adult cultural immersion, current events, social and political science-type studies that will be relevant to the duties of a future US Army Officer, but this will not be a military to military interaction.  Length of the immersion will be 14 to 15 days including travel to/from the countries.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION:  For Informational Purposes Only.  The following actions are awarded under Modification no. 122  that recognizes various Work Authorizations (WA) shown below.  They are issued under Management and Operating (M&O) Contract number DE-AC52-06NA25396.  These actions are funded by Recovery Act dollars. The M&O Contractor DUNS number is 175252894.   

1)  This action recognizes Work Authorization (WA) No. KP/NS03/0/ARRA-1, Rev. 00 (LASO # RA-10-027)   The description of the work involved under this WA is shown below:  $2,500,000 in Operating Funds (OPE) funding is provided under KP-15-01-02-1 for field work proposal 2010LANL2014 submitted in response to an early career funding opportunity announcement.  The proposed area of research is to develop An integrated theory on the mechanisms of vegetation survival and mortality during drought.  The goal of the research is to address three critical knowledge gaps.  The project period is April 15, 2010 through April 14, 2015.  
Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Contract for WA* (added to description in FedBizOpps):  Los Alamos National Security, LLC (LANS) was selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) to participate in this Recovery Act work due to LANS expertise in the subject matter. The funds will support the principal investigator approx. 9 months/year along with other support staff in the subject title area.  Work will include the three areas:  (i) carbon starvation and hydraulic failure; (ii) variation of vegetation mortality with plant size; (iii) the role of moisture vs. temperature as mortality drivers during drought   The work falls within the Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the Office of Science, which is allowed under the prime contract Section J, Appendix B, Statement of Work, Section 3.3.2, entitled Biological and Environmental Research of the current contract based on the following paragraph:  The Contractor shall conduct research in structural biology, genomics, cellular response to low doses of radiation, climate change research, environmental remediation, advanced medical imaging and other health and environmental sciences.    This is a Cost-Reimbursable type contract.  

2)  This action recognizes WA No. _KB/AL03/09/ARRA-4, Rev. 00_(LASO # RA-10-029).  The description of the work involved under this Work Authorization is shown below:  Funds in the amount of $2,500,000 are provided under KB-01-01-05-2 to carryout research with the goal being to produce a prototype multi-cell superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity that generates an accelerating gradient of 100 MV(mega volts)/m or higher with a quality factor of 2 x 1010 or higher.  
Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Contract for WA* (added to description in FedBizOpps):  LANS was selected by DOE to participate in this American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) work as part of a Laboratory-University Collaboration due to Los Alamos National Laboratory's (LANLs) expertise in the subject matter. The funds will support a five-tiered research process, and if successful, the developed technology will enable smaller, more energy-efficient and cost-effective particle accelerators that benefit from SRF cavities.  The work now falls within the Nuclear Physics Program of the Office of Science, which is allowed under the prime contract Section J, Appendix B, Statement of Work Section 3.3, entitled High Energy and Nuclear Physics of the current Contract based on the following paragraph:  The Contractor shall conduct high energy and nuclear physics research involving experimental and theoretical programs in nuclear and particle physics.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONUpon the basis of the following justification, I, as Sherita Crosby, Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, FAR 13.501(a) permitting other than full and open competition and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source. 1.	Identification of the agency, contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a justification for other than full and open competition.The U.S. Department of Veterans Health Administration, VISN 9 Acquisition Service Center, 1639 Medical Center Parkway, Suite 400, proposes to enter into a six month extension under an existing contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for the James H. Quillen VAMC (JHQ VAMC) Emergency Room Services Department located in Johnson City, Tennessee.  This document is a justification for other than full and open competition.2.	The nature and/or description of the action being approved, i.e., sole source, limited competition, establishment of a new source, etc.The healthcare services of a contracted pool of Emergency Medical Services Physicians and Mid-Level Practitioners are being procured using commercial item procedures in accordance with FAR 13.5.  The contract action will be issued as a fixed price modification to an existing fixed price contract awarded competitively to Johnson City Emergency Physicians PC.  The Emergency Room at the James H. Quillen VAMC operates as a Level Three Trauma Facility on a twenty-four (24) hour, seven (7) days a week basis, including all holidays.  This justification for other than full and open competition is required for the continued uninterrupted emergency room services while sources are solicited for the replacement follow-on contract for services.James H. Quillen VAMC has submitted a procurement request package to re-solicitation of these services prior to the expiration of this contract.   3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs.The James H. Quillen VAMCs requirement is for the integrated management and staffing of their emergency room department to include approximately 4.0 FTE Emergency Room Physicians and approximately 2.0 FTE Emergency Room Mid-Level Practitioners (i.e. Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant, Certified Registered Nurse, Anesthesiologist etc.) to provide emergency services to veteran patrons of the James H. Quillen VA Medical Center located within Johnson City, TN. 4.	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, and FAR 13.501(a) Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.5.	A statement demonstrating the unique qualifications of the proposed contractor or the nature of the action requiring the use of the authority.The competencies and skills required of the company providing and managing the Emergency Room Physicians and Mid-Level practitioners are critical to the daily operation of the Hospital.  The incumbent contractor is the only provider who is currently capable of providing and managing a full suite of Emergency Room Physicians in sufficient quantities that allow for appropriate and required rest between shifts; and Physicians that are currently qualified, VA credentialed and privileged to provide type services.  Further, Johnson City Emergency Physicians PC has been successfully performing under a competitively awarded contract over the last two years.   Johnson City Emergency Physicians PC is unique in that they are currently the only known capable local source of providing and managing qualified, competent, and a skilled Physicians and Mid-Level Extenders in sufficient quantities to operate a Level Three Trauma Emergency Room Department on a twenty-four (24) hour, seven (7) days a week basis, including all holidays.Additionally, as a result of Johnson City Emergency Physicians PCs locality to the VAMC and its 24 hour on call availability, they are able to provide the services required with the greater efficiency than any locum tenens contractor on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule.   6.	A description of efforts to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. Include whether or not a FedBizOps announcement was made and what response, if any, was received, or include the exception under FAR 5.202 if not synopsizing.  Describe whether any additional or similar requirements are anticipated in the future (this may not be included as an addendum, but must be in the body of the JOFOC).Future similar requirements for a full time the management and provision of Emergency Room Physicians and Mid-Level Extender staffing will be advertised under the forthcoming solicitation to be released on FedBizOpps.  Additionally a sources sought announcement was previously released under VA-249-10-RI-0093 on January 6, 2010 to seek additional interested sources for the forthcoming follow-on services.  7.	The anticipated dollar value of the proposed acquisition, including options if applicable, and a determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.The estimated total value of this six (6) month extension of services is $859,107.  The Contracting Officer has determined the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable based on the fact the extended price is synonymous with the price for services as determined to be fair and reasonable for the basic competitive award.Based on the foregoing information, the Contracting Officer can make a reasonable determination that the anticipated cost to the Government using Johnson City Emergency Services PC will be fair and reasonable.8.	A description of the market research conducted and the results.See also description above under paragraph six (6).9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.N/A10.	A listing of any sources that expressed a written interest in the acquisition.N/A11.	A statement of any actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition, if subsequent acquisitions are anticipated.The requesting service at James H. Quillen VAMC and the Acquisition Service Center is currently in the pre procurement planning process for competitive solicitation of the follow-on services.  CertificationThe information contained in this justification for other than full and open competition is certified accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.Acquisition Initiator:                                       I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance, which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification, are complete and accurate. ____________________     __________     Signature                                DateContracting Officer:I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  Since this effort exceeds $550K, this certification serves as CONCURRENCE.____________________     __________     Signature                                Date
