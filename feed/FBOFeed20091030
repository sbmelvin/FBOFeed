1.	System Overview
The system developed to satisfy this requirement, the Air Force MRDSS, incorporates all aspects of decision support required for management and deployment of people and equipment from MAJCOM and United States Air Force (USAF) medical views.  MRDSS enables the USAF medical community to quickly and effectively monitor a unit's personnel/training and equipment readiness status in peacetime and wartime environments.  Medical readiness and logistics planners more efficiently and effectively assess unit readiness and manage their assigned resources from a unit type code (UTC) perspective.  MAJCOM planners determine deployment and employment requirements from operations plans (OPLANs) or operations orders, and then determine the readiness of the appropriate UTC for assigned or gained units.  Planners use the detailed unit readiness data to make more accurate readiness decisions.  The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) uses the Medical Resource Letter (MRL) function to manage current ! and future AFMS UTC requirements.  From these UTC requirements, manpower resources and materiel costs can be projected for current and fiscal out-years.  Unit-level users monitor and update personnel UTC-specific, Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)-specific, and Readiness Skills Verification Program (RSVP) training; assign individuals to UTCs; track deployed personnel and materiel; maintain Disaster Team assignments; and maintain unit Recall Rosters.  Users at all levels can immediately assess materiel shortfalls (both War Reserve stocks and Homeland Defense (HLD)) down to the line-item detail and determine costs associated with improving readiness.  AFMS AFSC Consultants use MRDSS to track and assess availability of Low Density-High Demand medical specialists to fill critical deployment positions.
2.	System Background
MRDSS provides visibility of information being reported by the units.  Unit medical readiness and medical logistics personnel can use MRDSS to display the percentages of readiness capability for assigned UTCs; view materiel information; and update readiness personnel, training, and deployment information on the MRDSS Web server.  MAJCOMs can edit their units' input to ensure accuracy and completeness.
MRDSS is essential to proper USAF medical readiness operations and assists units, MAJCOMS and HQ USAF in managing and deploying medical personnel and materiel.  In accordance with (IAW) Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 8500.2, Information Assurance (IA) Implementation, MRDSS is a Mission Assurance Category (MAC) II, Sensitive system.MRDSS supports all Active Duty, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard Medical units worldwide.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for assistance and services in the implementation ofthe Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Education and Public Outreach (EPO) plan for theLunar Quest Program Office. This procurement is for the seamless transition of LRO EPOeffort from the pre-launch/commissioning mission phase and thepost-launch/post-commissioning phase of the LRO mission. This effort will include thedraft of a new LRO EPO Implementation Plan as well as the evaluation and recommendationof continuance of existing LRO Instrument EPO Plans. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Science Systems and Applications, Inc.(SSAI)Competition is impractical because SSAI having provided EPO support to the LPRP programis very familiar with the LRO project and can provide continued effective and timelysupport during this transition without any gap or duplication of cost and effort. SSAIhas developed and currently maintain several LRO mission specific outreach products andeducational tools for Agency supported activities such as Galaxy Zoo, Lunar Librarians,WALL*E Digital Learning Network Module, Field Trip to the Moon, NASA Moon Math Booklet,Moon Wall Exhibit, and the Lunar Student Imaging Project. It is essential to both missionand Agency education and public outreach goals and objectives that these products andtools continue to be maintained and updated as spacecraft data is received during itsoperational phase. The program, mission requirements and timeframe necessiate immediateimplementation; thus, the need for existing system familiarity and expertise is virtuallyunavoidable.LRO is a high-visibility project at NASA/GSFC, NASA/MSFC, NASA/HQ . Its mission is toprovide data for ESMD lunar exploration effort as well as to support planetary scientificdiscovery for SMD. For these reasons, it is of benefit to NASA to continue itsaffiliation with SSAI, an institution like that is well recognized in the education andpublic outreach community and consistently performs exceptionally well amid the highdemands that go hand in hand with high-visibility.SSAI has existing relationships with NASA education partners including the MuseumAlliance, NASA Explore, Lunar Planetary Science Institute, American Geophphysical Union,and the NASA Lunar Science Institute.  These existing relationships will help facilitatethe seemless transfer of LRO EPO from pre-launch to the operational phase.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon Friday, November 13, 2009.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solelyfor the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), U. S. Department of Labor (DOL) is posting this sources sought notice for facilities and services to host the Coal Mine National Mine Rescue Contests for 2011 and 2013 at a location east of the Mississippi river. MSHA desires a location with good highway and air travel access to facilitate travel by contest participants and MSHA personnel. MSHA has held the coal mine national mine rescue contests on a bi-annual basis to encourage large scale industry participation, while not creating a cost prohibitive requirement that companies would struggle to meet on an annual basis. Coal Mine rescue teams are sponsored by industry and perform an invaluable service to the mining industry. MSHA will use responses from this RFI to formulate a bidder's list. MSHA will eventually award a contract for two contest years - 2011 &amp; 2013.<br />Because MSHA has sponsored Mine Rescue contests in the past, and promoted national recognition for the winners, industry participation has grown to such an extent that only the largest facilities can handle the participation of the number of teams sent to the bi-annual contests. The expected number of contestants could be between 1200-1500 industry participants.<br />MSHA must contract for large facilities, meeting rooms, hotel space, and meals to accommodate the MSHA employees, who coordinate the contests, evaluate results, create and review problems and solutions, and encourage teams to compete. MSHA has traditionally held the coal rescue contests on indoor facilities as large as state fairgrounds to accommodate the number of participants and government and industry personnel required to make the contests successful. The growth of mine rescue contests has severely limited the number of facilities within the US that are large enough to handle the national mine rescue contests. MSHA seeks to maximize participation by holding the contest east of the Mississippi river where the majority of the coal mining operations exist in the continental US.<br />Hotel and event facilities large enough to hold a coal mine rescue contest are also in high demand by private industry and Government organizations that have many personnel attending Industry and Government wide conferences, seminars, training sessions and other events. MSHA is planning to hold the 2011 and 2013 contests during the period of mid-September through mid-October for 2011 and 2013. The schedule would be as follows: Move in, Set-up and Registration on Saturday and Sunday; Events on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday &amp; Thursday; with Awards banquet to be held on Thursday evening. Check out and removal of equipment and rescue contest materials on Friday and Saturday, if necessary.
<p>More specific requirements are estimated to be according to the list below.</p>
<p>1. Space requirements are:<br />Approximately 264,000 indoor contiguous sq. ft. of exhibit space for fields and vendors; with 54,000 sq. ft. administrative space and lock-up space, and 50, 000 sq. ft. of ballroom space for the awards banquet.</p>
<p>2. Parking requirements for mine rescue team trucks and equipment:<br />A minimum of 100 - Secured parking spaces for Team Trucks/Trailers and Parking for Officials &amp; Participants.</p>
<p>3. Chairs and Tables<br />Monday - First Aid and Bench Contest <br />200 - 6 foot tables<br />30 - 8 foot tables<br />850 - Chairs<br />Tuesday and Wednesday - Mine Rescue Competition<br />400 - 6 foot tables<br />1,600 - Chairs<br />Thursday - Preshift Competition<br />200 - 6 foot tables<br />575 - Chairs<br />Thursday - Banquet<br />225 - 8 foot round tables<br />1,800 - Chairs</p>

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies approximately 4275 contiguous net usable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease at 51 North First Street, Ellendale, North Dakota 58436.  The Government intends on exercising a (5) year renewal option at this location.  The space must be available for occupancy on or before January 1, 2010.  The delineated area is bounded as follows:  
North- 96th Street SE
East- 90th Ave SE; 1st Street N; 6th Ave S 
South- 98th Street SE
West- 88th Ave SE

Other applicable requirements include:	
- Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)
- Parking  28 on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessors control

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)
3. ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet and the Common Area Factor.
4. Contact Information for Owner or Authorized Agent.

This is not a Solicitation for Offer, nor is this a request for proposal.  The Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this advertisement.

WRITTEN NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY OF SPACE MUST BE SUBMITTED BY
4: 00 PM ON Friday November 10th, 2009.

<DESC>Question 1: Is there an incumbent for this requirement?<BR><BR>Response- This requirement pertains to new course development, therefore there is not currently an incumbent performing these services. However, Tyonek Manufacturing was the last vendor to perform services similar to those in the solicitation.  <BR><BR>Question 2: On page 12 of 61, it states that Course #990 is 32 hours, and that Course #991 is 24 hours, for a total of 60 hrs. However, on pg 22, Appendix A, it states that the Combined Sessions for 990/991 are to only be 40 hrs total. Is this a misprint, or is the contractor required to develop an alternate learning strategy in the Instructor Lesson Plan for shortening these two courses to 40 hrs total when they are taught together in the combined sessions?<BR><BR>Response- Yes, the contractor is required to develop an alternate learning strategy in the Instructor Lesson Plan for shortening these two courses to 40 hrs total when they are taught together in the combined sessions.<BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is SAQMMA10M0030 and is issued as an invitation for bids (IFB), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-36. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334510 with a small business size standard of 500.00 employees. This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids. The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2009-11-10 11:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com. FOB Destination shall be Arlington , VA 22209<BR><BR>The Department of State requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, M295 decontamination kits: The M-295 Decontamination Kit allows personnel to decontaminate individual equipment through physical removal and absorption of chemical agents. The kit consists of a pouch containing four individual wipe-down mitts enclosed in a soft protective packet. The packet is designed to fit comfortably within a pocket of the battle dress over-garment. Each mitt is comprised of a decontaminating powder contained within a nonwoven polyester material and a polyethylene film backing, which allows the powder to flow freely when in use. Decontamination is accomplished through using both the nonwoven polyester pad and the decontaminating powder., 40, EA;<BR>LI 002, M256A1 detector kits: Used to detect and identify blood, blister and nerve agents present either as liquid or as vapor. May be used to determine when it is safe to unmask, to locate and identify chemical hazards (reconnaissance), and to monitor decontamination effectiveness. The M256 is not an alarm; it is a tool used after an individual has received other warnings about the possible presence of chemical warfare agents, and have responded by putting on their chemical protective clothing., 50, EA;<BR>LI 003, M256A1 training kit:  A M256A1 trainer simulator was developed to provide realistic training while avoiding unnecessary exposure to potentially carcinogenic reagents in the M256A1 detector kit. The M256A1 trainer contains 36 pre-engineered detector tickets and an instruction booklet. The pre-engineered detector tickets show color changes comparable to those seen when the M256A1 detector kit is used in clean or contaminated environments.Agents Detected:	Hydrogen Cyanide / AC / Blood (cyanide) 	Cyanogen Chloride / CK / Blood (cyanide) 	Mustard / H / Blister 	Nitrogen Mustard / HN / Blister 	Distilled Mustard / HD / Blister 	Phosgene Oxime / CX / Blister 	Lewsite / L / Blister 	Nerve Agents / V and G / Nerve, 75, EA;<BR>LI 004, M8 paper:  The M8 paper is used to test liquid substances for the presence of nerve agents and blister agents. It is similar to the litmus (pH) paper that is found in almost any laboratory in that a test result is indicated in both types of paper by a change in color. The difference is that M8 paper is specifically designed (dye-impregnated) to react to nerve agents and blister agents in liquid form (M8 Paper is also issued to soldiers as a separate piece of chemical detection equipment). The soldier blots the M8 paper on a suspected liquid agent and observes for color change. There is a color chart inside the front cover of the booklet for comparison. The M8 paper comes in 4 x 2.5 booklets, each containing 25 sheets of detector paper., 50, EA;<BR>LI 005, Nerve Agent Vapor Detector (NAVD):  Detector is a simple, inexpensive, expendable device designed for the individual soldier to detect nerve gas vapors. The detectors can be used to quickly determine if a chemical attack detected by a gas alarm system is dangerous in the immediate vicinity of the individual or when it is safe to unmask. NAVD Nerve Agent Vapor Detector consists of: A plastic detector body containing an enzyme impregnated test paper & instruction sheet; a plastic holder containing a chemically impregnated test paper. Testing Procedure: 1. moisten the test paper in the detector body and expose it to the atmosphere. 2. Press the detector body into the holder so that the papers contact. The test paper will change color to blue or green in absence of nerve agent vapor. If nerve agent vapor is present or the test has been incorrectly performed, the color of the test paper will remain unchanged., 50, EA;<BR>LI 006, First Responder Safety Scissors:  Precision cut paramedic shears made of hardened stainless steel give unsurpassed performance under the most demanding conditions. The serrated edges of these medical scissors assist in the cutting of the toughest materials. Blunt tip protects against skin abrasions., 50, EA; <BR><BR>For this solicitation, Department of State intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction.

	(c)	The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contacting Office, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

	(d)	The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer.

		(3)	Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will:

	(4)	The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.

1752.224-70 		Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (May 2009)	   	

	(a)	Applicability

	This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

	(b)	Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information, can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

	(c)	Responsibilities for Handling PII

		(1)	Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

		(2)	All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:
&#61607;	responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.
&#61607;	responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.
&#61607;	responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.
&#61607;	Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

	(d)	Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

		(1)	OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agencys network.   

		(2)	A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e)	Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

		(1)	A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

		(2)	OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk  regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPMs IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

1752.224-71	Freedom of Information Act Requests (Sep 2009)

	(a)	Offerors are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Therefore:

		(1)	All items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked in all documents submitted to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM or The Government).

		(2)	No later than five (5) business days after award of a contract, blanket purchase agreement (BPA), or order, the Contractor must provide OPM a redacted copy of the contract/BPA/order in electronic format.

	(b)	Any information made available to the Contractor by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract and must not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract.

That section provides, in pertinent part, that whoever knowingly converts to their use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys, or disposes of any record of the United States or whoever receives the same with intent to convert it to their use or gain, knowing it to have been converted, shall be guilty of a crime punishable by a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisoned up to ten years, or both.

The service contract wage determination applicable for the location of the proposed hotel facility will be made a part of any resulting award if FAR clause 52.222-41 is determined to be applicable.  Each offer shall indicate if credit card (VISA) is an acceptable form of payment.  Award will be made to the lowest priced offer determined to be technically acceptable.  To be determined technically acceptable, the following minimum requirements must be met: (1) The quote must provide for all services, lodging, conference space, support equipment and furnishings.  NOTE: Quote may allow for conference space to be accommodated at two separate facilities (lodging must be provided in one of the two facilities), provided the two facilities are located no more than 10 miles (15 minute driving time) from one another.  (2) Hotel (and conference facility if separate from hotel) must have on-site parking or if off-site parking, hotel (facility) must provide valet services at no cost to the Government attendees. (3) Hotel must have at least one full service restaurant on site capable of feeding all attendees or have a full service restaurant located within three blocks of the hotel. (4) Hotel must be located in the Richmond (Tri-Cities), VA area.  (5) Hotel must be FEMA approved.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost and a conference space accommodations chart must accompany the quote. For minimum requirements (2), (3), & (5) offeror must provide a fact sheet which addresses each minimum requirement.  Mapquest.com will be used to determine if the facilities are within 10 miles of one another and if proposed facility is inside or outside a 10 mile radius of Mullins Armory, 5901 Beulah Road, Sandston, VA.  The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided in order a determination can be made as if minimum requirement (4) can be met.  If the information required is available on-line, a website address can be provided in lieu of the fact sheet.  Pricing shall be provided on attached pricing worksheet.  For purposes of price evaluation, if there is a mathematical error in which the unit price multiplied by the quantity does not equal the extended total, the unit price will prevail and be used for evaluation and award purposes.  In addition, when evaluating price, travel cost between facilities will be calculated; therefore the physical address of all facilities to be utilized must be provided.  Travel cost will be calculated based on thirty (30) vehicles traveling at the government mileage rate, $0.55, multiplied by the distance between the facilities as calculated by Mapquest.com.  The calculation will also be applied to facilities within a 10 mile radius of Mullins Armory from the contractors facility(ies) to 5901 Beulah Road, Sandston, VA.  Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Should any term or condition (i.e. number of hours prior to event attendee may cancel reservation, etc.) be altered, offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the governments best interest to accept the proposed alternative. In anticipation of questions regarding if the government per diem rate is required, the following response is provided.  The solicitation is being issued on a competitive basis.  The rate utilized for purposes of award will be the rates proposed by the offeror determined to offer the lowest technically acceptable offer.  As stated in paragraph (g) of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Provision 52.212-1, included in this solicitation, The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint&.All questions shall be submitted in writing and received prior to the time and date scheduled for receipt of quotes.  Questions can be sent via email, rebecca.fowler@us.army.mil or fax (434) 298-6202. Quotes are due not later than 5:30 pm ET, Friday, November 13, 2009.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format set forth in Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR), Part 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This solicitation is issued as RFP-10-09-375.  The solicitation document incorporates the Statement of Work, provisions and clauses.  The  NAICS code number for this requirement is 541930 and the Business Size Standard is $6 Million.   The Government intents on awarding a Firm Fix Price contract.  The closing date for this solicitation is 11/23/09 at 2:30pm.  The cut off date for all questions is 11/17/09.

DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires translation services in support of regulatory research projects and to fulfill its contracts, arrangements, and letters of agreement with 33 foreign governments and international regulatory agencies.  These foreign governments and international regulatory agencies are members with the NRC of bilateral or multilateral cooperative programs or protocols for the international exchange of nuclear research technology, including information regarding nuclear safety, safeguards, waste management, physical protection of nuclear material at fixed sites or in transit, radiation protection, emergency planning, strengthening of organization oversight, etc. 

The objective of this contract is to procure translation services in support of both the NRCs domestic mission to secure the public health and safety and its commitments to international cooperation.  The NRC requires translation into English of technical, legal, and regulatory documents generated by foreign governments and research institutions, and the occasional translation of NRC documents into foreign languages.  The majority of the documents translated are covered by four principal language groups: Germanic (German, Dutch, Swedish), Romance (French, Italian, Spanish), East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), and Eastern European (Russian, Ukrainian).  On rare occasions, the NRC requires translation of documents from or to Slavic languages, such as Czech or Slovak, or the Finno-Ugric subfamily of Uralic languages, such as Finnish or Hungarian.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR) (FEB 2005)<br /><br />a. Ken Marston is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The COTR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the Contractor by a unilateral modification to the Contract.

<p>NOAA/ERAD METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR<br />SHIP REPAIR (AUGUST 2005)</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule, as follows:</p>
<p>A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar work items.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.232-25 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>
<p>Name and Address of the contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />CLIN/Work Item No., Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>The invoice must include:</p>
<p>a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Ship name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.</p>
<p>Note: When invoicing for growth work, the contractor shall identify it as Growth and shall identify the modification number to which authorization was given and the CLIN/work item that the growth is associated.</p>
<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.</p>
<p>All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration provided all supporting documentation is submitted and validated.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:</p>
<p>Department of Commerce/NOAA<br />Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD)<br />Attn: Robin Resweber<br />200 Granby Street, 8th Floor<br />Norfolk, VA 23510<br />Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER EA133M-09-SU-XXXX (to be assigned upon contract award). &#61618;</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)<br /><br />The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0002) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for this Dockside Availability are listed in Section B. <br /><br />b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:</p>
<p>1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in <br />direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.<br /><br />2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.</p>
<p>3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.</p>
<p>c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0002). The estimated worth of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.</p>
<p>d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.<br /><br />e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0002) and additional material (CLIN 0003) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

Power to be at desk height or at base level?<BR>ANSWER: Either, or both, configurations would be acceptable.<BR><BR>10. Does your group work with oversize documents?<BR>ANSWER: No. The personnel occupying these offices will be working with standard sized documents.<BR><BR>11. Please confirm typical equipment requirements for each station: Monitor (flat panel?) CPU and keyboard tray?  Do some users have multiple monitors?

<DESC><p>*** FA8509-09-R-23400-0001 , dated 30 Oct 2009 ***<br /><br />Based on proposals received under RFP FA8509-R-23400, Lightweight Paratroop Doors, the Government has concluded ambiguities contained within the Performance-Based Work Statement, the lack of critical evaluation information under Sections L and M, and the best estimate quantities (BEQs) requested in the CLIN structure under Section B, may have created an environment not conducive to adequate competition based on a huge disparity between all offerors. Therefore, while the scope of the requirement for the Lightweight Paratroop Doors is not changed, the Government is amending RFP FA8509-09-R-23400 in an attempt to provide a more clear, concise Performance Based Work Statement and evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Amendment 0001 cover page, dated and signed, is required to be returned simultaneously with all revised pricing and technical volumes/proposals no later than 4:30 pm EST, 16 November 2009. Digital proposals are required and should be sent via email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:wendi.lough@robins.af.mil">wendi.lough@robins.af.mil</a> with a cc to Beckie.King@robins.af.mil. Hard copies will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The following changes have been incorporated in to the RFP as follows:<br /><br />Section B - CLIN structure has been updated to include references to specific PWS paragraphs in an attempt to provide clarity; firm quantities provided for Group A and B kits.</p>
<p>Section I - Transportation and Packaging information has been updated to included the use of a MORD instead of a TAC.</p>
<p>Section J - PWS revised to add specific information and required details for spring requirement.</p>
<p>Sections L and M - Revised Technical Evaluation Factors</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED REGARDING THE NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (NGA) NEW CAMPUS EAST (NCE) BASE OPERATIONS SUPPORT ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS. NGA intends to award a competitive unrestricted Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract to a contractor/contractor team with the proven ability to support, operate, maintain and sustain the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, New Campus East,(NGA-NCE), site and facilities, located on the Fort Belvoir Engineering Proving Ground (EPG) in Northern Virginia.
NGA-NCE site is 130+/- acres with a total of approximately 2, 419,000 gross square feet of buildings.  The NGA-NCE is a classified campus that will includes a mix of administrative, training-conferencing centers, computer laboratories and data centers, command center, library and general support areas.   NGA-NCE will accommodate approximately 8,500 employees.  

The successful contractor must demonstrate the ability to manage, plan, and execute all the functions associated with establishing and sustaining a high performing full service base operations support program.  Interested parties are invited to respond to this Presolicitation Notice, which is issued following the procedures described under FAR 15.202 entitled "Advisory multi-step process". The result of this pre-solicitation notice will help determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist. Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This is a pre-solicitation notice for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NGA. NGA will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this request for capabilities statements. The projected award date is January 2009.

Please ensure the Request for Capability Statement (RFC) number HM0140-08-R-0002 and program title (NGA-NCE BOSC) is referenced on all correspondence.  Telephone requests for this Presolicitation Notice WILL NOT be honored and no prospective Offerors list shall be maintained.         

ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS: This advisory multi-step process is divided into two (2) steps. Step 1 consists of the submission of the Contractor Capability Statement, agency evaluation of the capability statement, and subsequent advisory notification to contractors of their likelihood of being a viable competitor. Step 2 consists of the solicitation, conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This Step will be initiated by issuing a formal RFP in the near future.     
All contractor personnel must have or be capable of getting a TS/SI/TK security clearance with a CI Polygraph. 

STEP 1: SUBMISSION OF CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY STATEMENT, GOVERNMENT EVALUATION AND ADVISORY NOTIFICATION: This step includes submission of the Contractor Capability Statement followed by Government evaluation and advisory notification.  Please note that no questions will be accepted during Step 1. The capability statement Evaluation Criteria are included in this announcement.

A. Submission of Contractor Capability Statement: Interested contractors are invited to submit a Capability Statement describing the information requested in the Contractor Capability Statement Instructions below. Contractor Capability Statements must be submitted electronically to Paula.J.Ireland@nga.mil and Elizabeth.NievesTorres@nga.mil no later than 4:00PM EDST, 21 December 2007. Responding to this requirement will require a significant effort on the part of the contractor to propose to the Government. It will also require a substantial effort on the part of the Government's evaluation team to evaluate an array of different approaches or solutions. It is the Government's intent through the use of the advisory multi-step process to limit the number of contractors that will go through the time, expense, and effort of developing proposals to those that are deemed most qualified. Contractors contemplating competing for this contract award are to make a realistic self-assessment as to whether your organization has the experience and capacity to compete. 

B. Government Evaluations: The Contractor Capability Statement will be evaluated based upon the areas and criteria identified in the Contractor Capability Statement Instructions and Evaluation Criteria section. The Government will complete the Step 1 advisory multi-step process without communicating with the contractors who provide submissions.

C. Advisory Notifications: NGA will issue an advisory notification stating that the respondent, based on the information submitted, is likely or unlikely to be a viable competitor. The Government (NGA) will advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, all respondents may participate in the resultant acquisition.

CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY STATEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

CORRECTION / CLARIFICATION of the presolicitation announcement posted on October 20, 2009.
THE PROJECT SOLICITATION CONSISTS OF TWO PHASES.  This Pre-Solicitation Notice represents Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), of this Two-Phase Design-Build process.  To be further evaluated, firms must submit information in response to the criteria previously established in this RFQ by the specified due date and time. This notice represents solicitation of qualification statements as Phase One of the two-phased selection approach.
The DUE DATE AND TIME for qualifications in response to this Phase One RFQ is confirmed as 2:00 P.M. (MST) November 30, 2009.
The contractor's design will be based on the NPS Schematic Design, which will be provided in a subsequent Request for Proposals (Phase Two). Contractor recommendations for creative cost saving and/or quality-enhancing design solutions will be considered via the later RFP/Phase Two process.
All design-build firms have 30 days from the date of this notice to provide qualifications for evaluation based upon the following criteria in descending order of importance:  
 1.  Past performance demonstrating quality of work, professional expertise, technical competence and ability to effectively schedule and manage a multi-disciplinary work force.  2.  Extent of design/build experience, especially experience that the offeror's current A/E/construction company partnership has working together; demonstrated subcontracting opportunities with small business concerns and exceeding minimum subcontracting goals. 3.  Demonstrated ability to provide innovative, cost effective design and construction solutions, with emphasis on sustainable methods and technologies, and a commitment to improving on the initial design concepts without adding to the overall project cost. 4.  Experience with projects of a type and scope similar to that of this project, which includes conventional trenching and horizontal directional drilling techniques, ability to design and construct automated controls for water flows.5. Experience working in remote areas with environmentally sensitive resources.

Design-build firms/teams that meet the requirements of this announcement are invited to submit a Standard Form 330, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, to the office indicated above for Phase One evaluation. The SF 330's are formatted for architect-engineer and related services but this form will be used for both design and construction qualifications. The SF 330 can be downloaded from the forms library section at following website:  http://www.gsa.gov.
Only hard copy responses received by 2:00 P.M. LOCAL TIME ON November 30, 2009, will be evaluated further. Up to five of the most highly qualified design-build firms will be short-listed to participate in Phase Two of this design-build selection process.
In Phase Two, those firms short-listed will be sent a Request for Proposal (RFP) which will contain the National Park Service Schematic Design, performance specifications, and evaluation criteria for technical and firm-fixed price proposals.  Offerors will be required to prepare a proposal that may include design enhancements/cost-savings measures, and a project management plan describing the contractor's management philosophy, proposed schedule, team organization, and quality control as part of the Phase Two technical proposals.  The RFP will not require new design drawings as part of the Phase Two submittal.  A price proposal will be required along with the technical and management proposals.
Each short-listed offeror will be required to submit both a technical and price proposal within 45 days after the RFP is issued based upon evaluation factors identified in the RFP.   Award of a single contract will be made to the "best value" offeror.  Debriefings will be made available after contract award. Because this acquisition would result in an award over $1,000,000, the final selected firm will be required to submit a subcontracting plan, if the firm is a large business concern.
For inquiries and clarifications, the primary point of contact is Rod Keiscome, Contracting Officer, phone number 303/969-2048, email rod_keiscome@nps.gov.  The alternate point of contact is Audrey Winters, Contract Specialist, phone number 303/969-2053, email audrey_winters@nps.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Note: this is not an RFP.  
An on-site meeting will be held at Mesa Verde National Park at 9:00 am, Tuesday, November 24, 2009.  Participants should meet at the Park's headquarters.  All interested parties are encouraged to attend.
All responsible sources may submit responses for consideration.  
Note:  Architectural/engineering (A/E) firms that were involved in the preparation of the final schematic design and performance specifications for this project are not eligible to participate in the subsequent design-build process.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The purpose of this amendment is to remind potential vendors that the Environmental Response Laboratory Network requirement remains open. In adddition, all questions are due on November 30, 2009 at 3:00 pm. EST.  All other terms and conditions remain the same.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the responsibility of enhancing national capabilities for decontamination and disposal as a result of terrorist events and environmental sampling and analysis of all environmental matrices in response to nationally significant incidents (NSI). To protect the nation from the potential threats posed by terrorism or environmental emergencies, the EPA implemented the Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN). The ERLN is one of five laboratory response networks under the Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The mission of the ERLN is to provide known laboratory capabilities, capacities, and quality data in a scalable, systematic, and coordinated response to environmental emergencies providing preparedness, response, remediation and recovery analytical support. Consequently, the USEPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of analyzing environmental sample matrices contaminated by toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs), biological agents, and radiochemical agents as a result of acts of terrorism or an environmental emergency. A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition. 
Potential vendors' viability will be evaluated on the following six factors: Accredited Quality System, Plans and Procedures, Sample Management System, Facilities for Sample Handling and Storage, Data Management and Exchange, and Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The ERLN review team will review these documents and calculate a score for the application based on criteria established by the EPA. This score is used to determine if the laboratory is eligible for ERLN and, as applicable, Water Laboratory Alliance (WLA) membership.

This requirement will be posted for approximately 90 days with a closing date of January 5, 2010 at 3:00 pm EST.  A copy of this request for quote (RFQ) # RFQ-DC-09-00337 including attachments will be available at the following locations: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm, and https://www.fbo.gov/.
Please submit ERLN application packet via electronic mail or in hard copy form to EPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) using the address provided below. No phone calls please.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment no. 2 is to clarify and incorporate the following questions and answers to this A-E 8(a)solicitation.
Question no 1: Specifically in the description of services to be procured (Fedbizopps) it is stated that "each completed drawing and specification must undergo a bid ability and constructability review certified by a professional construction engineer with 20 or more years experience in construction".  Is the professional construction engineer required to be a team member, or are the services to be provided by a consultant contracted whenever required, using the standard procedures for sub-contracting consultants?   

Government response to question no 1: A professional construction engineer with 20 or more years is required to be a team member.

Question no 2: How is "professional construction engineer" defined? To the best of may knowledge, that particular title is not recognized in Puerto Rico for the purposes of licenses, as opposed to the PE title that refers to an engineer who is duly-licensed to practice engineering in Puerto Rico.  There is no such requirement in order to be a general construction engineer in Puerto Rico.  Therefore, could those requirement be filled instead by a licensed professional engineer who has at least twenty years of construction experience.

Government response to question no 2: Yes, the requirement could be filled by a licensed professional engineer who has at least twenty years of construction experience.

The Procurement continue to be set-aside for 8(a) certified SBA Business Development Program for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals.  

The services still required under this solicitation are predominately  Architectural/Structural Design with Mechanical/Electrical Supporting Services, in nature. Everything else referenced under the initial announcement and amendment no 1 remain the same and in full force.  

The Closing date has been changed from August 21st, 2006 to September 5th, 2006.  Closing time remains the same (4:30pm).  

Three copies of the submissions shall be placed in a sealed envelope clearly identified and appropriately marked as follows:  Solicitation No. GS-02P-06-PC-D-3111, Predominately Architectural/Structural Design with Mechanical/Electrical Supporting Services, for projects located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Closing Date: September 5, 2006.

The program is implemented by a joint OFPP and SBA Policy Directive and Implementation Plan, dated May 25, 1999. The program consists of two major components--
(a) Unrestricted competition in designated industry groups; and
(b) Enhanced small business participation in 10 agency targeted industry categories.

19.1002 -- Definitions.
Emerging small business, as used in this Subpart, means a small business concern whose size is no greater than 50 percent of the numerical size standard applicable to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to a contracting opportunity.

(c) Measure the extent to which awards are made to a new category of small businesses known as emerging small businesses (ESBs), and to provide for certain acquisitions to be reserved for ESB participation only. This portion of the program is also limited to the designated industry groups listed in section 19.1005.

Reason Acquisition was not competed:

Subpart 19.10 -- Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program
19.1001 -- General.
The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program was established by the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15 U.S.C. 644 note). The program is implemented by a joint OFPP and SBA Policy Directive and Implementation Plan, dated May 25, 1999. The program consists of two major components--
(a) Unrestricted competition in designated industry groups; and
(b) Enhanced small business participation in 10 agency targeted industry categories.

19.1002 -- Definitions.
Emerging small business, as used in this Subpart, means a small business concern whose size is no greater than 50 percent of the numerical size standard applicable to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to a contracting opportunity.
Emerging small business reserve amount, for the designated groups described in 19.1005, means a threshold established by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of
(1) $30,000 for construction, refuse systems and related services, non-nuclear ship repair, landscaping and pest control services; and
(2) $50,000 for architectural and engineering services.

19.1003 -- Purpose.
The purpose of the Program is to --
(a) Assess the ability of small businesses to compete successfully in certain industry categories without competition being restricted by the use of small business set-asides. This portion of the program is limited to the designated industry groups listed in section 19.1005.
(b) Expand small business participation in 10 targeted industry categories through continued use of set-aside procedures, increased management attention, and specifically tailored acquisition procedures, as implemented through agency procedures.
(c) Measure the extent to which awards are made to a new category of small businesses known as emerging small businesses (ESBs), and to provide for certain acquisitions to be reserved for ESB participation only.

<AWARDEE>Accenture LLP, 11951 Freedom Drive
, Reston, VA 20190 US
<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS AWARD NOTICE IS POSTED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO Accenture LLP for reasons described as below.    In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-investment Act of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Government posts this notice of issuance of modification 0013 to task order 0008 of Accentures Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the Internal Revenue Services Total Information Processing Support Services-3 (TIPSS-3) Program.  The TIPSS-3 Program is a multiple agency contract that provides sources of information processing support services to the Department of Treasury, its Bureaus, and other federal agencies.  The TIPSS-3 IDIQ contracts, as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 16.504, provide for an indefinite delivery date and indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services during a fixed period.  Each task order placed against the IDIQ contract specifies a definitive requirement or quantity and delivery date. 

The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) program was created as a part of the Trade Act of 2002 to provide eligible individuals health insurance tax credits. Under this effort, the current HCTC program has been expanded to meet legislatively mandated due dates resulting from the recent enactment of the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (PL 111-05), also known as the Stimulus Bill. The ARRA includes provisions that change the administration of the HCTC program and significantly expands the volume of eligible taxpayers claiming the credit. Award of a modification to a previously competed task order under the authority of FAR 16.505 utilizing the IRS TIPSS-3 Program has been completed. The legislation does not allow for any ramp up period as it requires development & implementation within 60 days of its enactment.

This is a hybrid type task order consisting of Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), and Cost Reimbursement (No Fee). The modification is not wholly fixed price because the required work could not be fully defined as required for use of a fixed price structure.  Given the unknowns and risks involved in this ARRA work, it was in the best interest of the Government to issue a hybrid type order for this work. This will allow the Government to control price more accurately given the volatility of the work and our inability to control the future expansion needs of the program.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each individual site. 2) The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in the Allatoona recreation area. 3) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance, and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation. 4) This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public assess to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.
