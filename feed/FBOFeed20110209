<DESC><p>AFRL Space Experiments &amp; Programs Branch (RVEP) is pleased to announce that it intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for its next major space flight experiment in the next 3-6 months. An intensive review of many candidate technologies has been conducted, and two concepts were chosen for our BAA; one or both concepts will be selected for execution. The two concepts are Advanced Missile Warning Sensors Experiment (AMWSE) and the Advanced eXperiment In Orbital Manipulation (AXIOM).</p>
<p>AMWSE will characterize space-based advanced missile warning sensor technologies. This technology promises great potential for multiple military needs.</p>
<p>AXIOM is an experiment designed to demonstrate new uses for advanced solar array technologies combined with advanced Hall Effect thrusters. The AXIOM baseline is for a single high-power, lightweight solar array wing and a single Hall thruster implemented on a small spacecraft bus, though an implementation with two wings and two thrusters may be considered. Extensive orbital maneuvering will be accomplished at altitudes that may range from low Earth orbit through Geostationary orbit.</p>
<p>RVEP plans to host a Briefing for Industry (BFI) prior to release of the BAA. The objectives of the briefing will be to acquaint industry with information regarding how AFRL conducts flight experiments, provide additional technical information on the two experiments being considered, and receive industry input. This BFI will be beneficial in determining the basis for the acquisition strategy, which has not been finalized. <br /><br />Further details regarding this upcoming BFI will be posted in the near future as an update to this notice. The FedBizOpps website has a feature on this page where you can register to receive email notifications of any updates. If you choose not to register for these automatic e-mail update notices you can continue to check this website for further updates.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<BR>Market Research for additional quantities of the FBCB2 disk drive duplicator systems<BR>Purpose<BR>The purpose of the RFI is to conduct market research to gain knowledge and help the US Government understand the available commercial solutions to satisfy the DoD hard disk drive duplicating/purge requirements and estimates of what such items might cost.<BR><BR>Background<BR>The Project Manager (PM) Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Blue Force Tracking (BFT) Product Office is seeking sources for the procurement of hard disk drive duplicators/purgers during the year 2011 and beyond to support PM FBCB2 BFT operations worldwide.  FBCB2 BFT is a networked command and control system installed in US Army and Marine Corps tactical vehicles.  FBCB2 BFT platforms use commercial hard drives (solid state and rotating) to hold data for increased awareness and understanding of current battlefield tactical situations.  The quantity of hard disk drive duplicators within the FBCB2 BFT worldwide is now over 800.<BR><BR>The PM seeks to procure additional hard disk drive duplicators/purgers using a single award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.   The Government intends to make an initial purchase of approximately 100 hard disk duplicators.  Additional purchases may be made based upon future requirements. <BR><BR>The Army wants to add additional hard disk drive duplicators/purgers to their current inventory with improved duplication equipment that provides an order of magnitude improvement in duplication speed, accuracy, and ease of use.<BR><BR>Hard disk drives and associated FBCB2 equipment currently in use are:<BR>HARD DRIVES / FBCB2 EQUIPMENT<BR>CF29 60 GB (Rotating)    /  Type I CF29 Ruggedized Laptop Computers<BR>CF29 80GB (Rotating)     /  Type I CF29 Ruggedized Laptop Computers<BR>CF30 80 GB (Rotating)    /  Type II CF30 Ruggedized Laptop Computers<BR>CF30 120GB (Rotating)    /  Type II CF30 Ruggedized Laptop Computers<BR>CF30 250GB               /  Type II CF30 Ruggedized Laptop Computers<BR>Miltope DB20M 40 GB      /  Miltope Laptop Computers (750 or 915)<BR>Miltope DB20M 80GB       /  Miltope Laptop Computers (750 or 915)<BR>Miltope DB20M 160GB      /  Miltope Laptop Computers (750 or 915)<BR>DB20 40 GB               /  AN/UYK-128(V)1/3 Type III Pus (JV5)<BR>DB20 160GB (Rotating)    /  AN/UYK-128(V)1/3 Type III Pus (JV5)<BR>DB20 240GB               /  AN/UYK-128(V)1/3 Type III Pus (JV5)<BR>DB32 40GB (Solid State)  /  AN/UYK-128(V)1/3 Type II/III Pus (JV5, EV4, V4)<BR>DB32 40GB (Rotating)     /  AN/UYK-128(V)1/3 Type II/III Pus (JV5, EV4, V4)<BR>DB32 128GB (Solid State) /  AN/UYK-128(V)1/3 Type II/III Pus (JV5, EV4, V4)<BR>DB32 128GB (Rotating)    /  AN/UYK-128(V)1/3 Type II/III Pus (JV5, EV4, V4)<BR>DB32 160GB (Rotating)    /  AN/UYK-128(V)1/3 Type II/III Pus (JV5, EV4, V4)<BR>XFR 250GB                /  Dell E6400XFR Laptop Computer<BR>JPT SMART HD 128GB SS    /  Joint Platform Tablet<BR>MRT STEC8 HD 128GB       /  Movement Tracking System (MTS)<BR>CF18 HD 60GB             /  Panasonic Toughbook Laptop<BR>Paladin 40GB             /  PDFCS for M109A5 155mm gun<BR>Polywell HD 250GB SATA   /  NOC - Polywell Computer<BR><BR><BR><BR>Minimal Specifications<BR>* Duplicator shall have a disk purge capability.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science, intends to award a sole source contract to IsoSciences, 386 Maiden Lane, King of Prussia, PA 19406 for the purchase of carbon-13 stable isotope internal standards Eicosa5-8-11-14-17 pentaenoic acid [2H5], EPA-2H5] and docosa-4-7-10-13-16-19-hexaenoic acid [2H5], DHA-2H5] to be used in the analysis of human plasma. These internal standards are used in measuring the amount of trans fatty acids in NHANES population samples for CDC biomonitoring and epidemiological studies.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 325199, All Other Basic Organic Chemical Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 4 months.<br /><br />IsoSciences is the only company able to synthesize the required standards needed for the tFA project within the required time (less than three months) and with the specified purity. Other vendors were contacted, but they were unable to provide us with the specific time and compound specificity requirements.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The program requires the use of the C13 stable isotopes only. The stable isotopes were offered only as deuterated isotopes, by other vendors who were not able to synthesize C13 standards instead. Deuterated standards are not suitable for obtaining the most accurate results. Additionally, using other internal standards will decrease the method sensitivity and would require that the method be characterized all over again. This would require additional delays for several months and the use of very expensive and valuable blood plasma.</p>
<p>IsoSciences is the only vendor able to provide the compounds in a timely manner. C13 stable isotope standards for fatty acids require that they be custom made within the specified time and at the required purity level. The manufacturing of such compounds is a very complicated process which requires a highly skilled synthetic chemist to make these compounds. The compounds (materials) {Eicosa-5-8-11-14-17-pentaenoic acid-[2H5], EPA-2H5] and docosa-4-7-10-13-16-19-hexaenoic acid [2H5], DHA-2H5] } are urgently needed and will allow for the determination of measurable analytes in plasma as part of our commitment to determining the amount of trans fatty acids in NHANES assays from the US population. Also, only C13 compounds can be used for this project for specific analytes because they are more structurally similar to the corresponding trans fatty acids being quantitated for our chemical analysis. This laboratory currently uses C13 stable isotope internal standards from IsoSciences. Therefore C13 stable isotopes will allow for more sensitivity and selectivity and continuity of biomonitoring project activities.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to IsoSciences. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2011-Q-13218 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN February 24, 2011.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a sole source synopsis for the acquisition of strategic planning consulting services in support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In accordance with the authority at FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements", DARPA intends to negotiate a sole-source contract to acquire strategic planning consulting services from Kathleen L. Harger, sole proprietor. This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement and is issued for notification purposes only.</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) , Arlington, Virginia, intends to negotiate a sole-source contract to acquire strategic planning consulting services from Kathleen L. Harger, sole proprietor. Utilizing past experience in which Ms. Harger conducted a unique, one-time initiative for USD AT&amp;L that focused on the barriers to technology transition across the Defense Department, coupled with the knowledge gained through her work with DARPA's Adaptive Execution Office (AEO) to establish performance metrics for transition MOUs (Memorandum of Understanding) with the Military Services, Ms. Harger will provide strategic planning consulting services to DARPA's Special Assistant for Strategic Analysis and Roadmapping. The procurement is a sole source to Kathleen L. Harger because she possesses a specific, unmatched perspective on and experience with the challenges and mechanisms of Science and Technology transitions in the Department of Defense that is needed for this effort.</p>
<p><br />Delivery dates: February 2011 to August 2011<br />Delivery location: 3701 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

LINE ITEM 01: 1 Each  Monotoring System. BACKGROUND  The National Institutes of Health Clinical Research Center (  CRC) is a 240-bed hospital dedicated  entirely to research into advances in medical science and pu  blic health. Every patient is enrolled  in a research protocol. The Department of Laboratory Medicin  e serves as the clinical laboratory  of the CRC. The Department provides laboratory support for p  atient care and research protocols  on a 24-hour basis. The accreditation of the laboratory is c  ontingent on compliant with  regulations and policies from various regulatory agencies. O  ne of these standards required the  consistent, daily monitoring of temperatures of freezers and   refrigerators that house patient  samples and reagents used in the analysis of patient samples  . Currently this is a manual, time  consuming process that is performed by our technologists. Du  e to this manual approach we are  never 100% compliant with this requirement and our non-compl  iance is usually noted at our  annual inspections. Continuing with this manual process leav  es us open to possible action by an  accrediting agency.  PURPOSE  This request is for the initial purchase of 50 temperature m  onitoring devices as well as the  needed software to run the system. These will be placed on t  he most "critical" units within the  department and will allow us to have continuous hands off te  mperature monitoring on our  essential refrigeration and freezer units.  SCOPE OF WORK  The NIH Clinical Laboratory requires a wireless temperature   monitoring system for providing  computer network based real time temperature data meeting co  mpliance requirements from The  Joint Commission, CAP, AABB as well as meeting FDA CFR 21 pa  rt 11 audit / reporting  capabilities for its core research laboratory in Bethesda Ma  ryland. The software application must  reside within and be the property of the NIH and allow for w  eb based viewing with: email, text,  phone and visual alert functions to advise if refrigeration   equipment has exceeded temperature  thresholds.  Wireless frequency must be at 900mhz, FCC Regulated signal h  opping technology and provide 2  way communication for sensor to receive an, "ack" back from   server acknowledging data receipt.  Sensors must be able to hold data for up to 10 days in the e  vent the network fails and restore data  automatically with time and date stamp to server based appli  cation and be powered by 2 AA  batteries. Access Points are required to act as redundant da  ta storage for up to 2 months. 900mhz  Access Points must be capable of supporting an unlimited qua  ntity of sensors and signal  repeaters used to collect data, amplify the signal and resen  d data to access point(s). Infrastructure  must be able to support real time location system for the ta  gging and tracking of high value  medical devices and patients.  Available sensors must include, but not be limited to: dual   probe with single sensor with 5  minute transmission and immediate notification if temperatur  e exceeds threshold, door open /  close sensor, temperature and motion detection, CO2 monitori  ng, glycol probes, ultra low  thermocouple probes to -200C, combination temperature and hu  midity sensor.  Probes must come with NIST traceable certificates and vendor   must be an A2LA certified  laboratory. Probes may be exchanged to meet annual recalibra  tion and receive new NIST  calibration certificate.  ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS  This system will provide:   Receivers   Software that will run on a single PC that can receive sign  als for the access points,  process the data, and place it into a data base.  Repeaters 50 glycol sensor probes (wireless sensor)  Alert l  amp (_5>S J -  Ethernet enabled Access Points '  The system must operate on wireless hardware and the sensors   must have 2 way communication.  It must also be able to alert users 24/7 and be able to prod  uce graphs and record of historical  data. The user should be able to customize alert features. E  ach probe must be accompanied with  a NIST traceable certificate of calibration. Replacement of   the sensor probe should be user  friendly.  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT  There will be minimal environmental impact. The actual probe  s will be placed in the refrigerator  and freezer units and the system will use the wireless capab  ilities within the Clinical Center.  Software will need to be placed on a server within DLM.
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS:  The intent of the Government is to sole source this requirem  ent under Simplified Acquisition procedures FAR 13 and FAR 6  .302.1(2)(i) to the following contractor -------------- to p  rovide the following services which is lab supplies.  If the  re are interested parties that would desire to submit a quot  e the Government reserves the right to make a determination   whether the services deemed sole source would benefit from s  ubmission of the bid and if so will determine hereto if this   sole source shall be modify to full and open competition.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), COAC Services Branch (CSB), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Dr. Roy James Turner, 10207 Lorain Avenue, Silver Spring, MD 20901-2404 to provide Research Services in the Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch (MPTB), NIDCR.</p>
<p>The MPTB has a need for the services of an expert who has an in-depth knowledge of exocrine and membrane physiology and who can perform specialized bioinformatics and computational analyses of microarray and other related genomic and proteomic data.  This expertise is necessary in order to expand several programs being carried out within NIDCR involving salivary gene expression, Sjogren's syndrome, and other craniofacial disorder.  These studies are aimed at identifying genes, microRNAs, and amino acid residues whose expression or state is correlated with disease, physiological signaling pathways, viral infection, and/or normal function.  Because of the novel approaches being used and the complexities of the disease patterns being studied, expertise in exocrine and membrane physiology, as well as custom data analyses beyond what is possible with off-the-shelf analysis software, has proven to be necessary to examine and work with these data.</p>
<p>Analyses of existing data and data from ongoing studies related to salivary gene expression, Sjogren's syndrome, viral infection, and other craniofacial diseases and disorders will be carried out in consultation with NIDCR investigators by a scientist who has in-depth knowledge and understanding of salivary and membrane physiology, scientific data analysis, computer programming, and genetic biomarkers.  Specialized data analysis procedures and associated custom computer programs will be designed to perform the analyses and extract the information required by the investigators.  These programs will then be available to NIDCR for future use.  Research data and analyses will be collected and maintained on a daily basis on-site.</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the fact that Dr. Roy James Turner has the background, knowledge, and experience needed for this project.  Dr. Turner has a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Toronto (1971), many years of scientific data analysis and computer programming experience, and has worked as an independent investigator in renal, salivary, and membrane physiology for thirty (30) years, including twenty-four (24) years as a salivary physiologist and Senior Investigator at NIDCR.  He is uniquely qualified to work on this project.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be from 03/01/11 - 09/30/12.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, and is a small business set aside. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-49 (January 24, 2011).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by February 14, 2011 at 12:00pm Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.</p>
<p>Inquiries to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(DE)-2011-100-JML, may be submitted to the COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisitions, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6151, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Jonathan Lear.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from incumbent Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. of 8283 Greensboro Drive, Mclean, Virginia 22102-4904 for 125,050 (One hundred twenty-five thousand fifty) hours of Engineering and Technical Services along with associated Travel and Materials under contract N00421-09-C-0016 for the continuance of technical and engineering services to support continued research, design, development, integration, installation, test and evaluation, fielding, analysis, maintenance, training and logistics support of Navy, Army, Air Force, Special operations Forces, Joint Services, Federal Agencies, Counterdrug and other agencies Communications-Electronics Advanced Technology (CEAT) systems while the follow-on contract is being completed. This acquisition covers an extended period of performance of approximately six months that will run from 7 May 2011 to 6 November 2011. This procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to run out of ceiling 6 May 2011. Due to the ongoing nature of the projects currently being performed under contract N00421-09-C-0016 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The incumbent contractor (Booz Allen Hamilton) currently has fully trained personnel and a fully developed management system in place for execution of the required work. Resolicitation for the six month period would not only result in a break in service, but would incur excessive costs to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. For information contact Linda Ebbets, Code 2.5.1.2.4.4, via email: linda.ebbets@navy.mil.
<p>Per FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating the impact on the fielded systems, sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competitition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

<DESC>When designing a facility, it is usually desirable to maximize window area because of the amount of natural lighting it can provide. However, increasing window area will increase the cooling or heating loads on a building structure depending on the climate region, seasonal changes and solar orientation.  Low-emissivity and more recently developed, spectrally selective window glazing  are commercially available and have been proven to be very effective in reducing heat gain in hot climate conditions as well as reducing heating losses in colder climate areas. However, current solar reflective window glazing/film for energy efficiency are tailored to specific climate conditions and not universal for all climate situations.
 It is therefore desirable to have a universal energy efficient window glazing or film that can be applicable to all climate regions, seasonal changes as well as solar orientation of a building (i.e., north, south, east, or west side).

The glazing/film solution can be integrated into the glass or applied on to the glass as a coating.  If a coating solution is proposed it would be advantageous to provide a solution such as window film that can be attached to existing windows for retrofit applications as well as integrated into the manufacturing of new window and/or the glazing processes. A functional prototype should be delivered at about one year from the contract award date and, at which time, laboratory testing should commence.
 The total project time for Phase I should not exceed two years.

Topics of interest described below are areas that may be included in the abstract. Individual topics of interest are as follows:  (a) Identify a technology and methodology for achieving technical requirements. (b) The solar heat reflective film or glazing should be economically sensible and justifiable by the energy savings it can provide.  (c) The proposed glazing/film needs to be durable enough to withstand environmental degradation for the life of the facility or, at minimum, meet industry warranty standards for similar technology. (d) Maintenance requirements should be similar to that of existing window film/glazing. (e) Industry test standards should be used to verify performance of the prototype.
 (f) Visible light transmission is critical for optimizing the use of daylight and should be greater than 60%. (g) Reducing glare, blocking UV transmission and having low reflectivity is essential and should be addressed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - Z - The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public construction and is soliciting written expressions of interest from qualified Design/Build contractors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the referenced project. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220. The size standard is $33.5 million per year. This is an unrestricted procurement open to all large and small business concerns. This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 52.219-19).
<p>All firms shall submit a one page letter of interest on company letterhead. This letter shall include a statement of interest, number of personnel that will attend the pre-proposal conference and the firm's DUNs number Letters and certification are due to the office of the Contracting Officer no later than September 15, 2009. Send documentation to General Services Administration, Attn: Carrie Haman, Contracting Officer, 819 Taylor Street, Room 12B01, Fort Worth, TX 76102, or carrie.haman@gsa.gov. GSA retains the right to publish and distribute the list of offerors to other interested parties (i.e., subcontractors, etc.). The estimated contract value is $80,000,000 to $100,000,000. Funds allocated via www.recovery.gov reflect funds for the entire project and not just design and/or construction. Contractors should price according to the specifications. The Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is scheduled to be issued on or about September 15, 2009, via FedBizOps (http://www.fbo.gov/). Firms must send the letter of intent to gain access to the documents. A site-visit and Pre-proposal conference for Phase I is tentatively scheduled to be held on or about September 29, 2009, in Houston, Texas to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the project and technical evaluation criteria. Attendance at the Pre-proposal conference is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged. GSA intends to contract for complete design and construction services with the design/build contract that offers the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to design and construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration proposes major structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing upgrades to Houston's 26 year-old, twenty-two story U.S. Federal Building. While there are many work items, the following are especially significant. They include:</p>
<p>Replacement of the exterior building envelope with a new curtain wall system attached to the outside of the existing building structure; significant improvements to the outdoor plaza, installation of a new covered breezeway and garage improvements; retrofit of structural deficiencies discovered during the due diligence phase in design development; interior upgrades inclusive of finish and ADA upgrades at all non-compliant restrooms, first floor upgrades; significant improvements to the HVAC system; lighting controls to maximize energy efficiency opportunities created by improved day lighting within tenant space resulting from the new curtain wall and HVAC improvements. LEED Project certification is required with LEED Silver being the project goal.</p>
<p>The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract. The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 36.3 Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and Part 15 Source Selection procedures using the Best Value/Trade-off process. Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror. Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price. The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire design and construction project including the administrative cost of processing change orders throughout the course of this project. The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.202); based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government. The procurement process will be performed in two (2) phases. The successful offeror will be based on accumulative scores for both phases. Phase I Submission Requirements: Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for technical documents from those firms responding to this FBO announcement. Any scope changes by the Government that result from the pre-proposal conference or any other discussions may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission (Phase II) at no recompense to the offeror(s) ?. The technical factors for Phase I RFQ are tentatively as follows: (#1) Construction Firm Past Performance and Experience on Design/Build Projects; (#2) Design Firm Past Performance and Experience on Design/Build Projects; and (#3) Key Personnel Experience and Past Performance. Following the evaluation of the technical proposals, a competitive range of offerors that offer the best value will be selected in accordance with FAR Part 15.306(c) to further compete in Phase II. Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvement measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Phase I, or II shall become the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the drawings and specifications for use under this project at no recompense to the offeror(s). Phase I submittal requirements are due into the office of the Contracting Officer on or about October 15, 2009. Phase II Submission: Only firms selected within the competitive range will enter into this phase of the solicitation.</p>
<p>The technical factors for Phase II Request for Proposals (RFP) are tentatively as follows: (#1) Design Incorporating Approach and Project Approach; (#2) Preliminary Project Schedule. Price proposals and a Subcontracting Plan (if the offeror is not a small business concern) will also be required during Phase II. This procurement is open to small and large business concerns. Before award of the contract, the business concern (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable, proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR Part 19.7. GSA's Socio-Economic Program goals are below, but contractors should develop their own goals with these in mind: Small Business (36%), Small Disadvantaged Business (6%), Small Women-Owned Business (5%), HUBZone Business (3%), Veteran-owned (5%), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business (3%). Failure to submit and/or comply with the minimum requirements of the Subcontracting Plan will render the offeror unacceptable. Phase II submittal requirements are due into the office of the Contracting Officer no later than close of business on or about January 6, 2010. GSA shall schedule two site visit opportunities during this Phase. All questions and clarifications regarding the project documents (drawings, specifications, procedures, etc.) shall be put in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than close of business December 22, 2009. Production costs and proposal preparation costs are at the expense of the offeror.</p>
<p>All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the Solicitation Number GS-07P-09-UY-C-0008. This project is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY THAT FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. Reporting requirements from the contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

The United States Government seeks to lease class “A” professional, fully serviced office space in a quality building of sound construction. Space located on the second floor or higher is preferred; however, space cannot be located on the top floor of the building if rooftop access is within the space. Space on the first floor will be considered only when no other space is available. Space can be existing or proposed. Proposed space cannot be located in a building that also houses a day care facility, abortion clinic, mental health clinic, drug rehabilitation clinic, immigration office, probation office, public defender’s office, or social service agency. Proposed space cannot be located in a building that is within 1,000 feet of residential areas, places of worship, schools, hospitals, prisons, abortion clinics, mental health clinics, drug rehabilitation clinics, and/or day care facilities. 

A total of 20 secure, on-site parking spaces must be provided. The office space and parking must be accessible on an unrestricted 24/7 basis to government employees, 365 days per year.

Preference will be given to covered and on-site parking with secure fencing and controlled access. 

The space offered must consist of approximately 6,360 rentable square feet, and the space should yield 5,530 ANSI/BOMA usable square feet. The proposed lease is for ten (10) years, five (5) years firm, and should be fully serviced. Space must be ready for occupancy no later than December 1, 2010.

<DESC>This is a synopsis announcement and IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.  The Government will NOT reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this synopsis.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this synopsis.<BR><BR>USACE-AES plans to solicit offers for the award of base Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), which will serve to support the Construction and Design-Build of multiple projects/facilities in support of Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) facilities requirements in southern and western Afghanistan, often incorporating a specialty construction method requiring contractors to construct K-span (rolled metal arch) buildings.  <BR><BR>USACE-AES intends to award up to seven (7) contracts under this MATOC.  Each contract will include a 2-year base period (not-to-exceed (NTE) 24 months) and three, one-year option periods (NTE 12 months each).  The total period of performance will not exceed five years.  The total capacity of the MATOC will be $499,999,000.00.  While the Government contemplates awarding a target of seven MATOCs, it reserves the right to award more, less, or none at all.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The small business size standard is $33.5 Million.  The magnitude of construction for the basic MATOCs are estimated to be between $100,000,000.00 and $250,000,000.00.  The magnitude of construction for the individual Task Orders are estimated to be between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.<BR><BR>Individual design/build or construction efforts will be solicited from MATOC awardees and awarded by task order in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1), Fair Opportunity.  When issued, the solicitation will include one actual task order which will also be awarded.  Task orders will be firm-fixed-price for construction and design-build efforts in support of a full range of projects in various locations throughout the AES Area of Responsibility (AOR).  <BR><BR>Task Orders issued under this MATOC contract will primarily address new construction, design-build (D-B) , design-bid-build (D-B-B), site-adapt-construction (S-A-C) (which is design-build using bridging documents), multi-story construction, barracks, dining facilities, utilities and infrastructure construction, general building renovation, security, perimeters, new road construction, and general environmental work including but not limited to, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical and concrete work, etc.  Task orders will primarily include Afghan National Security Force (ANSF) construction and D-B projects, but may also include Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) and Military Construction (MILCON) projects involving a variety of trades, in the region.  <BR><BR>A project similar to the following description will be used to evaluate offers and serve as the first awarded Task Order.  This Task Order will be for the design, materials, labor, and equipment to construct buildings, utilities and other infrastructure for the expansion of a Corps and Brigade Garrison, located in the Afghanistan AOR, to include all facilities to be constructed with applicable drawings.   The task order may include design and construction of a courthouse, military police (MP) administration and/or training buildings, facilities for a Military Intelligence (MI) Kandak, four Kandak training buildings, and two literacy classrooms, for a design end population of approximately 600 personnel.  The buildings included in the sample project will be constructed using CMU and K-Span construction methods.  Final design drawings of most facilities, site work, construction, and related designs would be accomplished by the Contractor.   <BR><BR>The point-of-contact for this procurement is Raquel Blankenhorn, Contract Specialist, USACE-AES, APO AE 09355.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for software development solutions to support the Enhance the Veteran Experience and Access to HealthCare (EVEAH) Initiative.  The TAC intends to award a sole source firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract  to Halfaker and Associates, 2900 South Quincy Street, Suite 375, Arlington, VA  22206, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) pursuant to authority 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), Veterans First Contracting Program and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5, "Authorized or required by statute."  These software development solutions consist of software development, testing, verification, application architecture support, analysis support, installation, implementation, and deployment to meet the business needs of project Access to Care Reached Closer to Home (ARCH), part of the EVEAH initiative.  The EVEAH initiative, one of the Secretary of Veteran Affairs' (VA's) sixteen (16) transformational initiatives, focuses on eliminating disparities in access to care wherever they exist within our system.  There is currently no information in a Veteran's clinical or administrative records that can be used to identify eligibility for Project ARCH, which is based on Veterans driving time from their home site to a specific type of VA facility (e.g. primary, acute, specialty care).  In order to deliver the appropriate type of care, it is imperative to have an automated solution to identify eligible Veterans so the electronic health record can alert/notify VA staff when:  1) these Veterans present at any VA facility in the VISN; and 2) a Fee Referral consult for the specific type of service is made so that these specific Veterans can be referred to the Project ARCH staff.  The VA will continue to focus on the gaps for underserved Veteran populations, and on expanding their access so that every Veteran can get the care they need-at a convenient place and at the right time.  The EVEAH initiative includes outreach efforts to proactively identify and communicate with Veterans who may be eligible for these services.  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541511.  The estimated date of award for this action is March 18, 2011.  

This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive proposals.

Questions concerning this action can be addressed to James Martin, Contract Specialist, james.martin7@va.gov  and David Nostrant, Contracting Officer, david.nostrant@va.gov.

<p>Engineering Operations and Maintenance: Perform general operation, maintenance and administration of data and information components, products or systems (hereinafter referred to as systems); and including engineering to address O&amp;M problems. This effort is required to support information/intelligence requirements of AFRL, DIA, AFC2IC, ACC and other intelligence community customers.</p>
<p>This effort will mainly be to utilize the software engineering lifecycle process to implement and integrate a cohesive approach for the development and maintenance of program requirements. The work includes any or all life cycle phases, including, but not limited to analytical studies, system feasibility studies, technical support to system design, engineering efforts, system trade-off studies, design efforts for experimental demonstration efforts, software specification efforts, limited software development efforts to maintain existing systems, system simulations, component and systems integration, test and evaluation analysis, prototyping, functional evaluations of installed systems, and system analysis. In the course of performance, the Contractor will interface with various agencies at various DODIIS and U.S. Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Community sites worldwide via short term visits and electronic means in the Washington DC area, Hampton VA, and U.S. Intelligence Community sites worldwide including Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Korea, UK, Canada, Qatar, Germany and Japan and other hazardous and non-hazardous locations. On-site support is currently required in Germany, Colorado Springs, CO, San Antonio TX, the Washington DC area (MD, VA, and DC), Boston MA, and AFRL Rome Research Site to provide analysis, design, development, integration, testing, and evaluation of DODIIS Information Technology (IT) and to U.S. C4ISR Community systems and activities.</p>

<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Lori L. Anguilli, (315) 330-1955, Lori.Anguilli@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (APR 2010) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Karen Sue Hunter, Building 15, RM225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 FAX: 937-255-5036 COM: 937-904-4407. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the AFRL level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force Ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contract Specialist.</p>
<p>The draft Request for Proposal is expected to be posted for review and comment by potential offerors by the third (3rd) quarter of the Government fiscal year 2011. The solicitation is expected to be released within the third (3rd) quarter of the Government fiscal year 2011. When it is issued, the entire solicitation will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at https://www.fbo.gov. All prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of all other information pertaining to this solicitation.</p>
<p>While the Small Business Specialist, Janis Norelli, is the focal point for receipt of the statements of capabilities, technical questions should be directed to the Laboratory Program Manager, Donna Toole, 315-330-3972, or e-mail Donna.Toole@rl.af.mil. Contractual questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, John McCanney, 315-330-1403, or e-mail John.McCanney@rl.af.mil.</p>
<p>Large businesses are also encouraged to submit e-mails of intent to John.McCanney@rl.af.mil should this effort not be selected as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NOTE: Due to limitations of the FedBizOpps website, the Government is unable to post both the Sources Sought and Pre-Solicitation Notices using the same Solicitation Number. Therefore, the Government is posting the Sources Sought Notice at Solicitation Number "E11396_SEESAW6", which will contain only the Sources Sought Notice and all modifications thereto. The Pre-Solicitation Notice, Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP), if applicable, Request for Proposal and any additional updates will be posted to a Solicitation Number to be determined at a later date. All prospective offerors are instructed to continue to routinely monitor and register under Solicitation Number E11396_SEESAW6. At the time of the posting of the Pre-solicitation Notice, this Sources Sought Notice will be modified to identify the Pre-Solicitation number.</p>

In addition, any viable sources, not currently qualified, will conduct a demonstration of capability prior to award of contract. The response shall describe the potential offeror's qualifications in the following areas: (1) ICBM Programs. Describe current and past Minuteman programs conducted by the potential offeror and relevance to the services described herein. Describe knowledge of and experience with ICBM system level testing utilizing Squadron Data Simulator (SDS), Missile Guidance Set (MGS), Guidance &amp; Control Laboratory Test Stand (GCLTS), Ground Test Signal Conditioner (GTSC), SMIC Data Acquisition System (SMIC DAS), Test Buffer Unit (TBU), Site Monitoring System, fully operational Minuteman Launch Facilities (LF) with ground test missiles, fully operational Minuteman Launch Control Centers (LCC), Airborne Launch Control Center (ALCC) ground test station, and Wing Code Processor. (2) Management System. Describe the management approach to be employed on the program. (3) Personnel Experience. Describe the qualifications of personnel projected to work on this program. Management, engineering, and technical personnel should have experience on ICBM and /or similar program, including the details of those programs/contracts worked. (4) Facilities. Describe those facilities to be proved to the contractor's personnel to encourage optimum performance on the required tasks. (5) Demonstration of Capability. Describe the plan (and schedule), prior to contract award, that demonstrates the potential offeror's capability to perform all tasks required. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Air Force will not pay for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided.</p>
<p>A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted by 1 March 2011 to AFNWC/PKMA, ATTN: Kirk Dean, 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258 Room 25, Hill AFB UT 84056-5816, or kirk.dean@hill.af.mil. No phone or FAX requests will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>SCLERODERMA CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE OR TRANSPLANTATION STUDY (SCOT)<br />Small Business Sources Sought Notice<br />Solicitation Number: NIH-AI-2011117
<p><br />Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />Background<br />A trial entitled "A Randomized, Open-Label, Phase II Multi-Center Study of High Dose Immunosuppressive Therapy Using Total Body Irradiation, Cyclophosphamide, ATGAM, and Autologous Transplantation with Auto-CD34+HPC versus Intravenous Pulse Cyclophosphamide for the Treatment of Severe Systemic Sclerosis" otherwise known as the SCOT (Scleroderma: Cyclophosphamide or Transplantation) trial was developed under the leadership of Dr. Sullivan at Duke University in response to a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Prior to the opening of the trial in 2005, a Drug Master File along with Standard Operating Procedures for the production of the cellular product, Auto-CD34+HPC were written and submitted to the FDA. These documents were created in order to ensure consistency in manufacturing across clinical sites. Transplant centers were inspected and qualified for participation in the trial. Version 1.0 of the clinical protocol was submitted to the FDA in August 2004; the first site (Duke) was opened for enrollment in May 2005. Ultimately 8 transplant centers and 23 rheumatology centers were qualified for participation in the clinical trial.</p>
<p>Because of slow enrollment and new data regarding the treatments used in SCOT, the SCOT trial was redesigned in the fall of 2009. Results from recent updates to two previously completed studies were used to estimate the magnitude of the difference of the anticipated differences in survival and event free survival between the two treatment arms of SCOT. The new data revealed that group differences on the order of 20 percentage points could not be anticipated until 54 months following randomization. This analysis demonstrated that the trial as initially designed was underpowered to detect a difference between the arms at 44 months. In order to accommodate both the slow rate of enrollment and the new information on effect size, a hierarchical composite endpoint was developed. The study was amended to include the new endpoint at 54 months with a reduced sample size of 113 subjects.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives<br />The SCOT trial was originally designed as a phase III trial to determine whether event free survival would be greater in subjects with severe systemic sclerosis receiving high dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT) followed by Auto-CD34+HPC transplantation than in subjects who received a 12 month course of pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide at 44 months after randomization.</p>
<p>Despite the barriers, the study has randomized 64 subjects to date. The purpose of this contract is to provide funds to complete the clinical study. Enrollment will be closed March 31, 2011. Subject follow up will be completed 54 months following the randomization of the last subject.</p>
<p>A non randomized patient registry has been developed and is currently enrolling subjects. The collection of data from subjects eligible for participation in SCOT but who have declined to do so and are undergoing standard of care, will inform the rheumatology community about the progression of SSc in the current treatment climate. The registry will help to assess whether the outcomes for subjects enrolled in SCOT differ from those seen in individuals treated in the community.</p>
<p>Other tasks to be completed include: flow cytometry studies, high resolution computer assisted tomography studies, and mechanistic studies evaluating the underlying immunologic basis of scleroderma, the effect of treatment on disease status and collection and management of a specimen repository.</p>
<p><br />Project Requirements<br />&bull; The consortium of clinical sites developed by the contractor to perform this trial has been maintained and currently consists of 8 transplant centers across the US and Canada. In addition to the transplant centers, 11 rheumatology centers across the US and Canada work to treat and follow subjects from a wider geographic area. Clinical follow up for subjects participating in SCOT needs to be completed.</p>
<p>&bull; Follow up will continue for 54 months following the randomization of the last subject. This time period is essential in order to demonstrate efficacy given the sample size and statistical assumptions. Subjects will be seen on the schedule delineated in the clinical protocol. Data will be submitted to the Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center and publications on the outcome of the trial need to be written.</p>
<p>&bull; Long term follow up of mortality and morbidity of subjects originally enrolled in the Scleroderma Lung Study will be obtained in order to understand the long term effectiveness of cyclophosphamide in the treatment of scleroderma lung disease. A repository has been established for future use and is collecting serum, plasma, RNA, DNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p>
<p>&bull; Mechanistic studies are ongoing including pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide relative to clinical outcome in both arms of SCOT, immunophenotying by flow cytometry, pulmonary response as measured by high resolution compute assisted tomography, molecular analysis of T cell recovery, and the role of endothelial progenitor cells in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis.</p>
<p><br />Anticipated Period of Performance<br />Base: June 1, 2011 - September 30, 2015<br />Option: October 1, 2015 - September 30, 2016</p>
<p><br />Other Important Considerations<br />&bull; The transplant sites have to conform to standards for cell processing mandated by the FDA.<br />&bull; Incumbent developed a website, advertising, and educational materials to aid in the conduct of the trial. All of these materials require IRB review before they can be made public.</p>
<p><br />Capability Statement /Information Sought<br />Offerors must demonstrate related experience, describe available facilities, list the staff qualified to support this effort, has appropriate financial resources and the ability to complete the work by the designated contract completion date.</p>
<p><br />Disclaimer and Important Notes<br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>

<DESC>HC-144A THERMAL INSULATION FOR BLEED AIR COUPLINGS
<p>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The USCG Aircraft Logistics Center is seeking potential sources, and information from FAA certified vendors of like or similar products, that can provide removable, durable, and reusable thermal insulation for thirteen (13) bleed air couplings located forward of the center wing integral fuel tank structure of the USCG HC-144A aircraft. The USCG currently operates eleven, HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft manufactured by EADS-CASA in Seville, Spain. The CASA CN-235-300M provides the basis for the Coast Guard HC-144A, aircraft resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235-300M. The fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets, with each programmed for 1200-1500 flight hours annually. These Aircraft are continually inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with the Manufacturer's periodic requirements, and in conjunction with the specialized USCG Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System. The USCG will not be able to provide OEM manuals, drawings, or specifications for this requirement. Interested parties must have access to the OEM data and manuals. Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options. Also, state the approximate lead-time for acquiring your product. Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Additionally, detail any similar or like products your company has provided for use on other Department Of Defense (DoD) or Federal Government Aircraft. Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions. After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO). Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the USCG to award any contract. Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to: Wade Johnson, Contracting Officer, at U.S. Coast Guard ALC, 1664 Weeksville Road Bldg 63, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001 or e-mailed to Wade.Johnson@uscg.mil. TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Responses must be received no later than FEB 25, 2011 at 1545 hours (3:45 PM EST). Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the USCG make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.</p>

<a href="mailto:Samuel.Brown@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affair, VISN 7 Network Contracting Activity, intends to negotiate sole source procurement in accordance with Far Part 12 and Far Part 13.5 with RGI Informatics, LLC under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This procurement is a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) healthcare analytics software and system with associated supplies and services for all facilities located within VISN 7.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price contract for a Term License and shall include all labor, material, tools, equipment, training, software/software license, and all associated hardware required to furnish and install the healthcare analytics software.  The contractor will also provide five years of support for the system, which shall include periodic updates to the software, hosting / infrastructure, and professional services (data warehouse maintenance, server & database administration, analytics support, basic user support, and data standardization support).  In conjunction with the healthcare analytics software provided under this contract, VISN 7intends to install an ARK and / or ICU CIS. 
 Executive Summary. VISN 7 is implementing the Department of Veterans Affairs CIS (ICU/ARK) and Analytics program.  This program establishes technology infrastructure for the capture, storage and analysis of clinical data during the most critical and data intensive portions of a patientâ€™s hospital stay with the goals of improving patient safety and clinical outcomes, conserving heath care resources, and supporting research.  The upcoming solicitation will be for the requirements for the analytics component from the perspective of the intended clinical users.   The data available from electronic medical records contain a wealth of detailed information that is useful for clinical care, traditional and clinical effectiveness research, and the administration of health care â€“ medical analytics must provide the tools needed to access and examine the data.  
Medical analytics in the critical care areas (intensive care units, the operating and recovery rooms, as well as the emergency department) has great value.  Patients in these areas have the most complex diseases and therapies, variable clinical courses, and morbidity and mortality of all hospital locations. Specialized CIS medical record systems capture and store the vast amount of data recorded on patients while undergoing anesthesia and surgery or while in the intensive care unit.  Together these systems capture and store thousands of records of clinical data for every patient. 
The challenge of medical analytics. Unprocessed healthcare data are difficult to use and resident in a diversity of database architectures.  Analyzing that data has proven difficult in part because most medical analytics systems developed as an outgrowth of business analytics not biomedical research.  Unfortunately business analytics information technology is not well suited for the analysis of healthcare data.  The most basic business transaction is the buying and selling of goods and services.  The semantics of business transactions are straightforward and generally accepted.  The behavior of each type of business data, and its relationship to other data can readily be defined and incorporated in an analytic model as â€œbusiness rulesâ€ or metadata.  Before data can be used in business analytics or by business analytic systems, it must be well defined and its properties included in an analytic model.  These requirements severely limit the application of business analytics systems to healthcare. 
Clinical transactions and its associated data are fundamentally different than business transactions.  The semantics of healthcare data are not well defined or generally accepted for a broad range of healthcare data types and clinical business rules have, for the most part, yet to be developed.  The types and sources of healthcare data are both diverse and dissimilar.  The healthcare community has adopted only very limited standardized nomenclature to name data, or structure field entries.  Even within a unified organization like the Department of Veterans Affairs, there are major differences from hospital to hospital in the name and use of many of the VAâ€™s electronic medical record fields.  As a result, medical analytics requires a new generation of analytics technology that can accept and store healthcare data without first requiring semantic modeling or the pre-programming of clinical business rules.  
Medical analytics has additional requirements not addressed by most business analytics solutions. It must include the ability to analyze and find patterns across millions of rows of physiologic or genomic data and determine temporal relationships among all the diverse data sets. It must provide a true â€œad hocâ€ and iterative query environment with rapid query response times despite billions of records.  Furthermore, the architecture of many business intelligence, statistical or graphical visualization software tools requires that the data to be analyzed undergo â€˜pre-analysesâ€™ and be removed from the analytics system computer to the userâ€™s computer.  This distribution of patient specific data is a threat to patient confidentiality and privacy.  
VISN 7 REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICAL ANALYTICS
In the critical care setting, medical analytics must allow physicians and other clinicians to leverage the value of data generated by clinical information systems and medical devices to: 

-	Determine and implement best practice (comparative effectiveness), 
-	Reduce medical errors,
-	Add value to traditional research initiatives and 
-	Improve the quality the care.  
Medical Analytics can play a critical role in improving the quality and reducing the cost of health care. 
The desired outcome will enable healthcare professionals to directly access clinical data stores, which will improve patient care, reduce medical errors, and enable a broad range of research capabilities. The software and hardware shall be compatible with all existing computer programs/operating systems currently installed and shall allow for future upgrades to the existing systems in VISN 7.  These shall include but not be limited to the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) VISTA/CPRS, Windows XP, and VISTA, Microsoft Office Products, Internet Explorer, VA Windows Based programs and VA antivirus software.  All software to be provided under any resulting contract shall be Section 508 compliant. 
Application will not interfere with VA approved programs including but not limited to VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), VHA Barcode Medication Administration System (BCMA), Internet browser, etc.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 1: An analytic solution must be capable of extracting value from clinical data stores, (including but not limited to CIS (ICU and ARK), VISTA, and National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), specifically addressing issues relating to clinical quality; medical errors; healthcare costs; and comparisons of costs, practice patterns, and outcomes in addition to clinical and comparative effectiveness research endeavors. 
The healthcare analytics shall accept extract data from VISTA to include (but not limited to) data regarding inpatient and outpatient medications, PTF file data, orders, allergies, code status (including CWAD), problem lists, vital signs, laboratory results, bed movement, the VISTA Surgery Package (including NSQIP elements), and from a CIS.  Types of data include all clinical and administrative dataâ€”and specifically very granular dataâ€”recording physiologic and other clinical measurements as frequently as every 30 seconds.  The granularity of the analytic tables should reflect and directly relate to the clinical unit of inquiry and source system extract capabilities.
The solution must accept data from any clinical system that is Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) compliant or able to export or â€œprintâ€ to flat files.  The analytic solution shall be capable of including data from diverse sources, and specifically, shall be able to integrate VISTA and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Operating Room (OR) clinical systems data, regardless of vendor.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 1a: The analytic solution shall be capable, at a minimum, of updates on a daily basis from the CIS, ARK, VISTA, and NSQIP data sources.  The supporting data stores shall store data at the most detailed level captured by the CIS, and still support high performance query response times.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 2:  Analytics data shall span not only the entire critical care or surgical visit and include data from numerous sources as defined herein but relevant historic healthcare data for each patient (prior hospitalizations, ICU encounters, operations, diagnoses, etc.).  The analytic database must be capable of including data from diverse sources, and must specifically be able to integrate CIS/ARK and VistA data. 
- Accept data from any system that can export data, regardless of underlying software or hardware platform. 
- Store and integrate data from all major ICU and OR clinical information system vendors.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 3: Analytics design shall specifically allow for the storage and analysis of all very granular data captured by the CIS or ARK rather than a sample or summary of the data.  Physiologic data, including but not limited to, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, shall be captured by the CIS at least once a minute.  The analysis of detailed physiologic and assessment data offers an unprecedented opportunity to advance the quality of patient care.
- Provide access to (store and retrieve) physiologic data at the most detailed level available from the monitoring device or source clinical information system including digitized waveform.  At a minimum, store thirty second data from the OR and sixty second data from the ICU.
- Provide for the future addition and analysis of genomic data
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 4:  Permit clinical users who understand the data but do not have programming skills to directly analyze clinical data from ICU/ARK systems and VistA.  New queries or algorithms can be deployed without first requiring support from information technology experts.  To use the analytics, a clinical user need understand only the meaning of the data (e.g. what is a heart rate); it does not require specialized data analysis or programming skills. 
The analytic application or environment shall be both open and enabling.  It shall allow the user (e.g., clinician with no special training) to investigate the contents of fields through simple statistics, sorting, bounding, and filtering; create new tables, and new queries â€“ as well as access to analytic tables; including the ability to modify and add data elements, create new analytic tables, and author / program new queries. The analytic solution, including the capability of writing new questions, shall ensure high performance query response times even in the face of large databases and long tables (typically second to minutes). The analytic solution shall allow the user to create new analytic events and stratifications of populations from all suitable elements in the analytic solution; and to join any number of elements or events using the full range of Boolean operators.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 5: Accept user-generated concepts on the fly.  The analytics system must enable users to ask clinical questions of data without knowing the question in advance (true â€œad hocâ€ queries).  The analytic solution must allow the clinical user to create new analytic events (business rules) and stratifications of populations from all suitable elements in the analytic database but also to define data properties, define the relationship between data elements, and join any number of elements or events using the full range of Boolean operators.  The response time for these questions shall be rapid (within seconds / minutes).
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 6: The analytics must include the ability to analyze and find patterns across billions of rows of physiologic or genomic data and determine temporal relationships.  The solution must be able to work across rows and to provide for sequential analysis of data (time series) for all time-stamped elements or events. 
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 7:  The analytics system must support an iterative query environment, allowing the clinical user to iteratively formulate, test, and refine questions and accelerating the knowledge discovery process.  The response time for the majority of these queries must on the average be rapid (seconds/ minutes); 
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 8:  The analytics system must be ready to use and  a fully functioning commercially available system with demonstrated use in a complex clinical setting including EMR, ICU and ARK data.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 9:  The analytics should easily support  â€œstandardâ€ queries or reports as well as to easily and rapidly develop new queries.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 10:  The Analytics Solution shall have the capacity of developing/combing queries from individual VA facilities or from VISNs, as well as a rollup of national data. 
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 11:  Eliminate the costly and time consuming steps that most analytic systems and business intelligence software require before data can be used.
1.0	Data should be easily and readily be made available for analysis.  
1.1	Data does not require standardized nomenclature or field use.
1.2	The analytics does not require semantic modeling, the modeling of relationships or the pre-programming of clinical business rules.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 12:  The analytics must provide for the security of the data and protect the privacy of the patients with no data residing on the workstation.  The application shall meet standards set forth by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), The Privacy Act of 1974, Enterprise Architecture standards, and VA Cyber-Security requirements.  VA Policies on Confidentiality shall be strictly adhered to.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 13:  The application should be accessed through a web interface or equivalent technology with an extensive graphical user interface for sophisticated query generation including time series analyses and table joins.  GUI application must support remote view capabilities within hospital and from outside utilizing Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Citrix.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 14:  The system should be sized such that typical individual queries and analyses would have insignificant incremental costs.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 15:  The system must be capable of adapting new analyses technologies while maintaining functionality.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 16:  Libraries of queries should be included to facilitate groups of analyses and analysts.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 17:  Administrative management tools must be capable of limiting data/query access by user, patient, time ranges, facility, and individual data elements.  These tools must be intuitive, able to manage multiple individuals, and web-based.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 18:  The system must be capable of efficient data loads on a q 2 â€“ 24 hour frequency.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 19:  The system must be capable of administering activities of groups of users by easy sharing of queries, integrated help systems and version control of reports and queries.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 20:  The system must provide full statistical packages (e.g., SAS, STATA), extensive graphing capabilities, export of summary data results with tight controls for exporting sensitive data, and full audit trail of all user and administrative activities.  The healthcare analytics solution shall display results as tables, or graphs.  The user shall be able to save or display query parameters with the results.  
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 21: Individual provider reports created upon sign-in with access/verify codes and limited to the providerâ€™s specific patients.  The system shall allow: 1) the creation of custom reports, modification of existing reports, and custom enhancements to the user interface 2) development of VISN and other sites specific reports, 3) flexibility of developing reports as the needs of the facility change, and.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 22:  Sophisticated analysts must have programming assess to the full system analytic and data management capabilities.
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 23:  The contractor shall provide the analytic solution as a fully hosted service offering including support and management of the server, physical database, and analytic functions for the duration of the contract.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems Directorate (PM FSS), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: EI Electronics LLC, Westbury, NY 11590.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>This purchase is required for Wireless Data Acquisition hardware and software of Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems Equipment. Voltage, and current measurements of a 3-phase electrical system are required by the equipment procured. Wireless data acquisition is the most efficient process; due to the large amount of equipment being tested in the area. PM FSS requires that voltage, and current measurements of a 3-phase electrical system be acquired by equipment and sent back to a computer to be analyzed by project engineers.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Through the use of the internet, it was discovered that Electro Industries offered a wireless Power Sub-meter that logged and transmitted measurements through a wireless network to a computer. Due to the use of PM FSS's electrical system (cables, generators and power boxes), we were able to find a suitable 3 phase power sub meter through Electro Industries, Electro Industries offers a simple and compact sub-meter that meets all of the requirements of PM FSS. Other competitors offer a similar, but more complex product that is not as effective to the government due to an inefficient use of space. Additionally these more complex product options would increase the amount of training the government would need to provide in order for individuals to use such systems.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>Market research was performed using the Internet with Wireless Power Meter as the keyword.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (Soldier, Chemical, Research & Test), Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, has a requirement in support of US Army PM-Force Sustainment Systems to procure up to 72 Mobile Integrated Remains Systems (MIRCS) in order to complete the requirements of this program.  Guild Associates of Dublin, OH is currently the only manufacturer of these systems and is the only one that can meet the proposed delivery.  Given the history of this program, along with Market Research that has been conducted by technical experts, this is the best cost savings for the Government. Having to set-up a First Article Test and a new production line with a new contractor, for such a small quantity, would drastically impede the fielding schedule for deploying troops. These systems are currently being deployed in Theater at this time.  This acquisition will be procured under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), paragraph 6.302-1(a)(2), entitled "Only One Responsible Source".   This acquisition will be a set aside for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 333415.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code is 8711 and the Small Business Size Standard is 750 employees. Telephone calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems Directorate (PM FSS), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX 78759.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>Purchase Wireless Data Acquisition (WDA) hardware and software devices from a single source. The WDA devices are required to collect temperature, pressure and liquid flow data for evaluation and optimization of Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) equipment which will be set up at the Force Provider (FP) base camp training area at Ft. Devens, MA. Wireless data acquisition is the most efficient process to capture the required data due to amount of Equipment Under Test (EUT) and the far proximity of the EUT throughout the training area. The required Temperature, Pressure, and liquid Flow readings will be acquired by the WDA equipment and stored on a computer, accessible remotely by PM FSS engineers for analysis.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>National Instruments offers a unique solution to wireless data acquisition of Temperature, Pressure and Flow data. The National Instruments Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is the only WSN that creates a network independently, using the network of sensors and controllers placed in an area near each other. Also the LabVIEW  Software allows the data to be collected and interpreted using programs we already use, i.e. Microsoft Excel. In addition, LabVIEW   software also allows the user (PM FSS) to broadcast the information via the internet. This is the most convenient and accessible method due to the fact it would cut down trips for PM FSS to travel from Natick, MA to Fort Devens, MA.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>Market research was performed using the Internet with Wireless Data Acquisition as the keyword. Search results displayed National Instruments as the main provider for such equipment. Reviewing their products, and the products of their competitors, conclusion was reached that National Instruments, offered the only WDA products that met PM FSS' requirements.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>None<BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>None<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than 5:00 PM (EST) on February 14, 2011.<BR><BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-6180<BR>steve.streeter@us.army.mil<BR><BR>

<DESC>Introduction:  <BR><BR>Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Technology, Systems & Program Integration Directorate (TSPID) intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Eagle Picher Energy Products ULC., 13136-82A Avenue, Surrey, British Columbia, CANADA, V3W 9Y6.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR><BR>1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 13.106-1(b)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:  <BR><BR>Eagle Picher Energy Products, ULC., is the only manufacturer and distributor of the "Half Size" BA-5590 Lithium Carbon-monofluoride (LiCFx) primary battery, developed under contract W911QY-08-C-0047.   This battery was successfully demonstrated in the Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE), and is the only LiCFx battery with the correct dimensions, connector location, and compatibility with the SINCGARs power use profile for use in the AEWE experiment.  This battery is also the only product on the market that conforms to the required performance, safety, and transportation standards outlined in MIL-PRF-47491B and UN Transportation Standard ST/SG/AC.10/27/Add.2.  This battery is the only one to surpass the required Power ATO Wh/Kg threshold of 390.  The intent is to award a Firm Fixed Price type contract for $45,000.00. <BR><BR>3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Eagle Picher Energy Products, ULC., is the only manufacturer and distributor of the "Half Size" BA-5590 Lithium Carbon-monofluoride (LiCFx) primary battery, developed under contract W911QY-08-C-0047.  This contract was issued under the joint NSRDEC and CERDEC Army Technology Objective (ATO) "Power for the Dismounted Soldier D.LG.200S.01 ", and this BA-5590 battery has participated in previous Warfighter demonstrations, evaluations and other developmental venues. Also this BA-5590 has met all experimentation/demonstration safety requirements, a feat that cannot be accomplished with a new vendor in the limited amount of time before the AEWE is conducted.  The latest version produced by Eagle Picher has the highest energy density (WhlKg) available, which would allow the user to cany fewer batteries and successfully demonstrate an overall weight reduction.<BR>  <BR>4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  <BR><BR>Market research was not conducted because this is the only viable product to conduct our research. The "Half Size" BA-5590 was developed under the joint NSRDEC and CERDEC Army Technology Objective (ATO) "Power for the Dismounted Soldier D.LG.200S.01". Other vendors can propose developmental efforts related to LiCFx primary battery technology through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) hosted by the Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on their website at http://www3.natick.army.mil. As a result of this development effort and the subsequent evaluations conducted with the EPEP BA-5590 LiCFx primary battery there is no other item on the market that can satisty our requirements in the time allotted before the AEWE.<BR>	 <BR>5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: <BR><BR>Eagle Picher Energy Products, ULC., has been very responsive to governmental feedback, and has been on the forefront of advancing the LiCFx battery chemistries.  They have created the highest energy densities in LiCFx batteries to date while maintaining manufacturabiIity.<BR><BR>6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  <BR><BR>Not feasible at our level.<BR><BR>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: Lynn.M.Pina@us.army.mil no later than 8:00 a.m. on  February 18, 2011.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Lynn Pina, Contract Specialist<BR>Lynn.M.Pina@us.army.mil<BR>

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. This is a notice of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's (BEP) intent to solicit and award a sole source procurement set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.106-1(b)(1) wherein circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available, which in this case the determination is that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The purpose of the requirement is to establish a BPA under FAR Subpart 13.303 for the purchase a broad class of supplies that are proprietary in nature to the contractor and/or can only be obtained from the contractor (see Attachment A for a listing equipment and examples). The BEP currently has two (2) facilities; the Western Currency Facility and Eastern Currency Facility. These supplies though generally purchased from the contractor the exact items, quantities, and delivery requirements are not known in advance and may vary considerably as a result, this BPA provides for the general terms and conditions between the BEP and the contractor in the purchase of these supplies.</p>
<p>The maximum ceiling amount for this BPA is $150,000.00. The BEP intends to award a BPA to KBA-Giori S.A., Avenue Du Grey 55, P.O. Box 347 Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
<p>A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit documentation that clearly demonstrates their ability to provide equipment needed by the BEP. Responses to this notice shall be received by the February 15, 2011, at noon Eastern Time (ET). All responses must be in writing and are to be sent via email to Thomas.olinn@bep.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Denver, Colorado, intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to SureWorks, LLC, 618 Teal Circle, Suite 1B, Longmont, CO 80501. This ongoing research and development requirement is for software/electrical engineering support to fully develop a computerized panel display with touch panel interface for the Tracy Fish Collection Facility Count Station.  Fish species and numbers that are sub-sampled during count station procedures will be entered into a computer database using a computerized panel display with a touch panel interface that will be designed to Tracy Fish Collection Management and Operator specifications. This computerized interface would replace the use of paper record keeping and time spent entering the data into a computer later.  Images of seasonally entrained fishes that one could touch on the screen and enter quantity and provide notes if necessary would streamline the data collection process and provide greater accuracy with less human-related error.  Fish entrainment data will be gathered into Microsoft Excel and PDF documents for reporting and data management along with flow, operational, and facility-related information.  The output will also include automated daily graphs of entrainment and may include some statistical analyses with standard reports.  A fish species classification engine will be implemented to the count station in this third year phase of the contractor and Government research and development efforts.  The end goal of the project is to enable automatic identification and morphometric data of collected fish.  Proprieatry software that is being developed for the SmeltCam fish identification device by SureWorks, LLC. in conjunction with Bureau of Reclamation scientists, will be used for count station fish recognition.  Fish at the Tracy Fish Collection Facility are the same as those encountered during the SmeltCam project on the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.  Awarding to another contractor will result in a substantial duplication of research efforts because another contractor would not have the project-specific knowledge (covers a 4 year period of accumulated research effots), time investment, and inter-governmental agency research networking.   Ongoing information and data has been accumulated from both laboratory and field testing of fish identification software and algorithms which cannot be duplicated.   A final consideration is that the current research and development firm has proprietary rights to their developed software.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer.  Responses should include the firm's DUN and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 541990 which is $7 Million.  Any response shall be submitted no later than February 23, 2011, 4:00p.m. MST.   This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation for this ongoing research and development project.

<DESC>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a workshop, Stories, Neuroscience and Experimental Technologies (STORyNET): Analysis and Decomposition of Narratives in Security Contexts. This workshop is intended as a precursor to exploring the neurobiological mechanisms which undergird narrative processing so as to establish fertile ground for connecting our understanding of the neuropsychology of stories with models, simulations and sensors salient to security concerns. To this end, the workshop will focus on surveying theories of narrative, understanding what role they play in security domains, and establishing the state of the art in story analysis and decomposition frameworks.

<DESC><p>The 10th Contracting Squadron, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado, has received a request for Sole Source purchase of repair for an existing Continuum Precision II/ Sunlite EX laser system. This contract will be written for no more than 1 year. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-48, January 31, 2011. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334510 and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>USAFA requires repair/alignment/maintenance of an existing Continuum PR9010 laser system with the Sunlite EX OPO and BAP/FX wavelength extender. These systems suffered multiple component failures (burned window on OPO and seed laser malfunction) after approximately 7 years of service. The repair will include replacement of all electronic and optical components or subassemblies necessary to return the laser to a full operation condition. <br />The repair of the laser will require original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts as well as proprietary hardware and processes unique to Continuum. Such repair parts must be guaranteed to work with the existing nanosecond amplifier/OPO system.</p>
<p>Place of performance will be at HQ USAFA/DFP, USAFA CO 80840.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT submit a bid/quote at this time.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they can provide the required repair for a Continuum Precision II/ Sunlite EX laser system that meet all of the features and functions of the requirement described above may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim that they can provide all repairs with properly qualified personnel as identified in the agreement. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement can be conducted. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received NLT 5 p.m. Mountain Standard Time on February 14, 2011. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated.</p>

<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (APR 10)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, <br />Kim Diercks<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: kim.diercks@usafa.af.mil</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<a href="mailto:shannon.mitchell@navy.mil">shannon.mitchell@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>The proposed contract action is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 13.501. However, the Government will consider all responses received by 2:00pm EST on 16 February 2011. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
  
Booz Allen Hamilton is considered the only vendor who can provide these services required by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy Research, Development and Acquisition Chief Systems Engineer ASN(RDA) CHSENG to perform continued Probability of Program Success (PoPS) v2.2 and applicable Gate Review Core related support.
 The result is a ten gate review schedule covering the entire acquisition life cycle from the Joint Capabilities and Development System phase through the Operations and Support phase.  At each one of these ten gates there are 18 metrics covering all aspects of the acquisition process.  For each metric there are approximately six criteria used in determining the value/score of the metric.  This whole process equates to 180 metrics and almost 1100 criteria.  

BAH has been developing an initial set of fundamental tools to analyze the data which will help support acquisition program offices, Program Executive offices and System Commands in meeting the requirements of the ASN RDA memorandum. BAH conducted a summation briefing, the resulting analytical tools (beta version) and provided a tool demonstration.
  BAH developed the initial beta version of the tool as required by CHSENG.  A second beta version is required by the beginning of 3rd quarter FY11 with a final beta version due by the end of the 3rd quarter FY11. The development of the first accredited analytical tool set by BAH to assist ASN RDAâ€™s role in acquisition governance is due by the end of FY11. BAH has been involved in the technical details of the PoPS process for 30 months and the learning curve for another contractor to perform the total PoPS process in order to viably continue with the development of the analytical tool is significant.

All responses may be sent via email only to Shannon Mitchell at Shannon.Mitchell@navy.mil and reference number N00189-11-Q-0822.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole-source contract with the North Bethesda Marriott Hotel and Conference Center to provide conference space in support of the annual NRC awards ceremony meeting to be held on June 14, 2011.
<p>The objective of the awards ceremony meeting is to provide a forum for the Chairman and Commissioners to recognize NRC employee accomplishments this past year. The NRC requires the services of a hotel and conference center within close proximity to NRC headquarters (HQ) to allow timely access for employees. To ensure NRC employee participation, the meeting must be held within walking distance from the NRC Headquarters, located at 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852-2738. Historical data has shown that if the meeting location is not within walking distance of the NRC HQ, then NRC employee attendance decreases by 15 percent. By holding the meeting at a facility within walking distance from NRC HQ, employees will save an estimated 35 minutes per day (approximately $13,440 per day in cost savings to the NRC compared with traveling to a facility that is not within walking distance. Furthermore, transportation (i.e., shuttle buses, metro fare cards) for NRC employees to attend the meeting at a farther location would add considerable costs to the NRC. NRC will save approximately $49,500 in shuttle bus and approximately $13,500 in metro fare cards costs.</p>
<p>The North Bethesda Marriott Hotel and Conference Center (Marriott) is the only conference center that is located within walking distance from the NRC HQ that has the capacity to accommodate approximately 2,000 attendees for the meeting. The Marriott is located approximately 0.2 miles from NRC HQ and has extensive familiarity with NRC's security and meeting requirements as demonstrated by performing the annual Regulatory Information Conference in 2010, NRR All-Hands Meeting, the Integrated Regulatory Review Service Mission, and several other agency-wide and office-wide meetings. Therefore, the Marriott is the only conference facility that can meet NRC requirements in support of the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. Request for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services.<br /><br />Statutory authority:&nbsp; FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) Only one responsible source.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate and award, on a sole source basis, a modification to extend the performance period on contract W912ER-09-C-0039, with Fluor Intercontinental, Inc., Greenville, South Carolina. This action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, 'Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.' This action is required to extend operations and maintenance services for the Command Liaison Element (CLE) in Iraq for a period of performance: 10 March 2011 to 30 November 2011, in order to insure continuing service requirement. The current period of performance ends 09 March 2011. Award to any source other than Fluor Intercontinental, Inc would result in unacceptable delays and substantial cost that are considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition. This action will be awarded via a modification to the existing contract. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed towards Fluor Intercontinental, Inc. This notice of intent/synopsis is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available. All responses should be directed to Dee Warchola at deetra.c.warchola@ usace.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from publication of this synopsis.

<p>&nbsp;<strong>52.212-2</strong> <strong>EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /></strong>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement <br />(ii) Past Performance<br />(iii) Price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>In accordance with the FAR 13.106-1(a)(2), Soliciting Competition, Offerors are notified that award will be made on the basis of best value. Proposals received in response to subject request for proposal (RFP) shall be evaluated for technical acceptability and best value. Technically acceptable offers must meet all minimum specifications but offers which exceed the minimums may be rated more favorably. However, the Government will not pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price. Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision.</p>
<p><strong>52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984)<br /></strong>The Government contemplates award of a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Firm Fixed Price</span></strong> contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>

These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed <strong>6</strong> months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within <strong>60 DAYS</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)<br /></strong>(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 DAYS; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 DAYS before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed <strong>(5) FIVE YEARS AND (6) SIX MONTHS</strong>.</p>

<DESC>I. BACKGROUND AND NEED -
<p>GDM affects 2% to 10% of pregnancies in the United States. Although carbohydrate intolerance usually resolves after delivery, up to one-third of affected women will have diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism at postpartum screening, and it has been estimated that 15% to 50% will develop diabetes in the decades following the affected pregnancy. However, there is now strong evidence that interventions such as lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy can prevent or delay the development of disease in high-risk individuals, including women with a history of GDM. In addition, hyperglycemia in pregnancy has been associated with later obesity in offspring. However, it is unknown how the timing and intensity of the hyperglycemia or other related factors might influence offspring outcomes.</p>
<p>Previous studies of long-term outcomes of women with GDM and their offspring have been limited by a number of factors. In most studies, the results of post-partum screening for diabetes are unknown, making it difficult to separate women with undiagnosed preexisting diabetes from those with GDM. Studies of offspring fail to account for lifestyle factors after pregnancy, such as infant diet.</p>
<p>II. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to identify biomarkers that predict diabetes in women with recent GDM-affected pregnancies and growth in the offspring in the 1st year of life. The Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes (SWIFT) is a prospective observational study of women with recent GDM and without diabetes at 6-8 weeks postpartum. SWIFT examines the 2-year incidence of type 2 diabetes among women with recent GDM based on annual screening with the 2-hour 75 g OGTT. The SWIFT Offspring Study examines growth patterns by infant feeding method among infants of SWIFT mothers.</p>
<p>For the proposed work, maternal baseline biomarkers (plasma lipid profiles, adipocytokines, and hormones) and indicators of glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], glycated albumin [GA], and fructosamine) will be examined as potential predictors of future diabetes and of growth in offspring. In addition, saliva samples will be collected from the infants for future genetic studies.</p>
<p>III. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>We propose to secure services to analyze samples from 600 women for the following: lipid profile, adiponectin c-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), glycated albumin (GA), fructosamine, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), prolactin, and complete blood count, as well as to collect saliva from 325 offspring for storage for future analysis (Saliva Oragene Kit for offspring). The information generated from these analyses will be used to identify biomarkers that predict diabetes in women with recent GDM pregnancies and growth in the offspring in the 1st year of life. Findings from this work will provide new information regarding risk factors that may predict incident type 2 diabetes after a GDM pregnancy in a large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort. The collection of saliva from offspring will allow the investigators to conduct studies of genetic contributions to growth in offspring in the future. After this one-year, non-severable contract, CDC will not have further requirements from this vendor for this study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />IV. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>The vendor will provide all labor required to complete the tasks outlined below.</p>
<p>1. Obtain samples and transport to designated laboratory for analysis.<br />2. Use plasma samples (already collected and stored at -70&deg;C) from 600 women to conduct the following assays: <br />a. Lipid profile, fasting and complete <br />b. Adiponectin <br />c. C-reactive protein (CRP)<br />d. Leptin Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)<br />e. Glycated albumin (GA)<br />f. Fructosamine<br />g. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)<br />h. Prolactin<br />i. Complete Blood Count. <br />3. Send aggregate results to CDC in the form of a report.<br />4. Collect saliva from offspring (n=325) for future analysis, using Saliva Oragene Kits.<br />5. Send documentation of completion of saliva sample collection and storage to CDC.</p>
<p>V. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS<br />N/A</p>
<p><br />VI. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance shall commence upon award of a contract and shall continue through September 30, 2012 or until all activities are complete, whichever is sooner.</p>
<p>VII. DELIVERABLES <br />The vendor shall provide the following deliverables to the Project Officer by the dates reflected below.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLE BUDGET ACTIVITY DUE (MONTHS AFTER THE AWARD)<br />Documentation that samples for analysis have been identified and transported to designated laboratory for analysis. Month 2<br />Documentation that assays have been completed in the form of a report including results based on aggregated data Month 11<br />Documentation of successful collection of saliva samples from offspring Month 12</p>
<p>VII. MINIMUM VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>The vendor shall have expertise in the health consequences of gestational diabetes.</p>
<p>The vendor shall have experience conducting prospective observational studies in pregnant women.</p>
<p>The vendor shall have access to banked specimens from a cohort of women with GDM, information on outcomes including results of postpartum follow up evaluations, and on important potential confounders, such as breastfeeding.</p>
<p>The vendor shall have staff, facilities and infrastructure necessary to retrieve samples and analyze data.</p>
<p>The vendor shall have a lead investigator who will supervise research scientists, analysts, and other personnel.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point and Naval Post Graduate School are requesting a quote to provide Academic Red Hat Renewal for the Naval Postgraduate School CA.  Per Schedule of Supplies/Services.

This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR 13.  This procurement is brand name (Red Hat) and only vendors that are authorized to offer Academic Edition of Red Hat will be considered for award.

Acquisition Timeline:
Vendor Quotes due by: Close of Business, Wednesday, February 16, 2011 

Award issued on or before:  February 25, 2011 

Brand Name Justification: This requirement is for a Renew of existing Red Hat support ands for the NPS network.  The open source model allows the best technology to win in an open environment.
  Open source allows an unprecedented level of sharing and access. Red Hat Linux uses a graphical installer which simplifies usage for novices. This is the operating system that is currently being used in research, teaching, and in the enterprise network environment. The investment in previous work will be lost and would need to be regenerated if another product is used. The loss of this software would negatively impact NPSâ€™s mission.

Identification of Statutory Authority:	

(a) Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(c), an acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited.
  It shall be justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304.

(b) The use of a brand name description in this acquisition is essential to the Governmentâ€™s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  The hardware is a commercial item that has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition JOTFOC</p>
<p>Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by<br />FAR Subpart 6.3, HSAR 3006.3, HSAM 3006.3, CGAP 1206.3, and in accordance with (IAW)<br />requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR<br />Subpart 6.302-1 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as<br />follows:</p>
<p>1) Agency and Contracting Activity:<br />The US Coast Guard, Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN), Portsmouth Va. proposes to purchase equipment on a basis other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved:<br />Sole Source Procurement of items listed below in par-3 to support the Model SRSS-3 Prototype<br />with 8 modules, Rack Mount.</p>
<p>3) Description ofSupplies:<br />The proposed acquisition consists of the following items:<br />2 each of: SRSS-3 Squelch Proto-Type<br />1 each of: Re-design Board to Add Audio Presence Indicator Circuit<br />1 each of: SRSS-2 Spare Module<br />Estimated value of all items: $8,500.00</p>
<p>4) Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open<br />Competition:<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as<br />implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled "Only One<br />Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."</p>
<p>Section (ii) "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of<br />a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly<br />specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any<br />other source would result in-</p>
<p>(AA) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition..." is directly applicable.</p>
<p>5) Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:<br />The US Coast Guard tasked C3CEN with developing a method for one watch-stander to<br />affectively monitor multiple HF receivers. While researching capabilities, SHIPCOMs SRSS was<br />identified as an acceptable means.</p>
<p>Conventional amplitude squelch circuits used in receivers operate on the principal that the<br />amplitude of a received signal must exceed a pre determined threshold before the squelch circuit<br />will un-mute the receiver allowing audio to the speaker. While this method works well for VHF<br />and above, it is unsuitable for &lsquo;our' use on HF. The static noise found in the HF bands causes the<br />operator to set the &lsquo;adjustable' squelch circuit to respond to a higher amplitude in order to<br />eliminate the static noise.</p>
<p>A noise compensated Syllabic Rate Squelch System (SRSS) circuit minimizes this problem by<br />achieving a high sensitivity to voice signals while at the same time being insensitive to the type<br />of noise typical on an HF circuit.</p>
<p>6) Description of Efforts Made to Ensure Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential<br />Sources as Practicable: Requirement shall be posted on to FEDBIZOPS. The posting will<br />include verbiage that any Offeror that feels that they can provide items that meet this<br />requirement as stated may provide a quotation, and the Government will consider all offers.</p>
<p>7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will<br />be Fair and Reasonable:<br />It is anticipated that the purchase cost for these items will be the same or less than the General<br />Public would pay for the same items in the Commercial Market place.</p>
<p>8) Description of Market Research:<br />We have performed market research via the internet, phone and meetings, and found NO other<br />products that perform similar functions.</p>
<p>9) Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />SRSS is proprietary equipment SHIPCOM LLC is the OEM that can provide this product and<br />these items.</p>
<p>10) A Listing of the Sources, if Any, That Expressed, in Writing, An Interest in the<br />Acquisition:<br />No other parties have expressed interest at this time.</p>
<p>11) A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any<br />Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services<br />Required:<br />None at this time.</p>
<p>12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. The<br />anticipated cost to the Government is Determined to be Fair and Reasonable.</p>
<p>James A. Lassiter<br />USCG Contracting Officer, date: Feb/08/20ll</p>
<p>I certify this procurement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting<br />data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The following clause is herby referenced by full text:</p>
<p>FAR 52.211-6 - Brand Name or Equal (AUG 1999)</p>
<p>(a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as "brand name or equal," the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation. <br />(b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must- <br />(1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; <br />(2) Clearly identify the item by- <br />(i) Brand name, if any; and <br />(ii) Make or model number; <br />(3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and <br />(4) Clearly describe any modifications the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modifications. <br />(c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. <br />(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. <br />(End of provision) <br />FAR 52.211-9 - Desired and Required Time of Delivery (Jun 1997)<br />(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:<br /><br />DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />1AA 3000 21<br />1AB 1000 21<br />1AC 2000 21<br />1AD 7000 21<br />If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:<br /><br />REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />1AA 3000 30<br />1AB 1000 30<br />1AC 2000 30<br />1AD 7000 30<br />Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.</p>
<p><br /><br />OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT</p>
<p>(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.215-9023 Reverse Auction (OCT 2009) <br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply.<br />(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.<br />(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on-line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on-line auction process. The Government intends to use a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction.<br />(c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on-line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.<br />(d) Prior to the on-line auction, the Government will determine whether either all offerors' prices or just the lowest offeror's price(s) will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the on-line auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). If the Government opts to disclose one or more offerors' prices, only generic identifiers will be used for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A", or "lowest priced offeror").

<p><br />The following clause is herby referenced by full text:<br />FAR 52.211-9 - Desired and Required Time of Delivery (Jun 1997)<br />(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:<br /><br />DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />1AA 3000 21<br />1AB 1000 21<br />1AC 2000 21<br />1AD 7000 21<br />If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.

The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.215-9023 Reverse Auction (OCT 2009) <br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply.<br />(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.<br />(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on-line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on-line auction process. The Government intends to use a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction.<br />(c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on-line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.<br />(d) Prior to the on-line auction, the Government will determine whether either all offerors' prices or just the lowest offeror's price(s) will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the on-line auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). If the Government opts to disclose one or more offerors' prices, only generic identifiers will be used for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A", or "lowest priced offeror"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction.<br />(e) An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />(f) The following information is provided regarding the procedures to be followed if a reverse auction is conducted.<br />(1) Each offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by DLA's commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.<br />(2) In order for an Offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions for using its service. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service provider's terms and conditions is available at [https://govauctions.procuri.com].<br />(3) Offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or the Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. Offerors shall keep their own and other offerors' pricing in confidence until after contract award.<br />(4) Any offeror unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider's system during a reverse auction must notify the Contracting Officer or designated representative [insert name and contact information for designated representative] immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the offeror and outside the offeror's control.<br />(5) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website: [https://govauctions.procuri.com]. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and Internet connection.<br />(6) Training:<br />(i) The commercial reverse auction service provider and/or a Government representative will provide familiarization training to offerors' employees; this training may be provided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider's website, and/or other means.<br />(ii) An employee of an offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a 'trained offeror.'

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

     (2) __ Outside the United States.

       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<p>Synopsis/Announcement:<br />This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Technical Division (TD), Technology Transfer Program under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to accelerated closure of environmental sites across the Air Force, eliminate or reduce hazardous material use and environmental release, and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Restoration, Compliance, Pollution Prevention, and Military Munitions Response Programs. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field. The areas of need include:</p>
<p>1. Characterization - Proposals should focus on improved methods for effective detection, quantification, monitoring, fate and transport modeling of NAPLs and innovative methodologies for sampling, data validation, and human health and ecological risk assessments for explosive residuals at Air Force installations.</p>
<p>2. Emerging Contaminants - Proposals should include sampling and analytical methodologies or innovative treatment technologies for contaminants currently on USEPA's Candidate Contaminant List that have potential Air Force implications pending future regulations.</p>
<p>3. Long-Term Monitoring (LTM) - Proposals should describe technologies and/or methodologies that reduce the labor requirements, sampling and analyses of waste generated, energy requirements, or other costs associated with LTM programs. Such technologies could include new sensors, analytical methodologies, or statistical methods.</p>
<p>4. Pollution Prevention - Proposals should identify opportunities to eliminate or reduce the release of hazardous chemicals or minimize the regulatory burden and cost associated with the use and life-cycle management of hazardous materials. Proposals should include some quantifiable measure for either reduced chemical use or release, achievement of Executive Order 13514 goals, and total process operational cost. Proposals involving Air Force Weapon Systems may be considered if compatible with existing technical order and specification requirements for targeted systems/component.</p>
<p>5. Remediation - Proposals should demonstrate/validate innovative and/or sustainable technologies for enhanced recovery of mobile LNAPL, removal of recoverable DNAPL, in-situ treatment of residual LNAPL in vadose zone soils, in-situ treatment of residual DNAPL in unconsolidated soils or fractured bedrock environments, or improved treatment of explosives residuals in soil, runoff, and groundwater.</p>
<p>Proposal submittal is a two-phase process. Phase I requires completion of a 2 page proposal online form (white paper), which is found along with instructions attached to this solicitation and can also be obtained at http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/baa. Additionally the U.S. Air Force "BAA Guide For Industry March 2008" is attached and is also on the BAA website. Each electronic submission shall address only one area of need and shall be in accordance with this announcement. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 16 DECEMBER 2010. Phase I submittals received after 16 December 2010 will be handled according to the rules under FAR52.215-1(c)(3). Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the selection criteria included with the proposal instructions. It is critical that proposals convey the requested information accurately and concisely to facilitate their review. Offerors whose proposals are judged innovative and that meet Air Force needs are notified electronically via email to submit a Phase II proposal; those not selected are notified accordingly. Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are provided a link in the electronic notification by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted. To be eligible for an award, submission of Phase I is required.

<p>&nbsp;<strong>52.212-2</strong> <strong>EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /></strong>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement <br />(ii) Past Performance<br />(iii) Price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>In accordance with the FAR 13.106-1(a)(2), Soliciting Competition, Offerors are notified that award will be made on the basis of best value. Proposals received in response to subject request for proposal (RFP) shall be evaluated for technical acceptability and best value. Technically acceptable offers must meet all minimum specifications but offers which exceed the minimums may be rated more favorably. However, the Government will not pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price. Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision.</p>
<p><strong>52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984)<br /></strong>The Government contemplates award of a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Firm Fixed Price</span></strong> contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)<br /></strong>The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.

<p><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance in the development of Chinese standards for smart grid infrastructure.</p>
<p>China Electric Power Research Institute (CEPRI) is the country's lead entity guiding the development of power sector including the timely deployment of modern technology for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power throughout China. CEPRI is the national research arm of the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) and is responsible for research, development, demonstration, and piloting of the latest technology in the power sector. Currently SGCC is implementing more than 220 different research and demonstration projects in 21 different technology areas throughout China. At the same time, the government of China is aggressively pursuing the modernization of its power sector as part of its 12th Five Year Plan (2007 - 2012), with smart grid deployment a top priority.</p>
<p>In the development of a national smart grid system, CEPRI's specific needs include 1) benchmarking various smart grid technologies and a preliminary assessment of their applicability to China's conditions and energy use patterns; 2) guidance on the process for developing technical standards for different technologies based on international best practices; and 3) advisory support on the development of appropriate regulations to accelerate the demonstration and commercial application of smart grid technology throughout China.</p>
<p>This technical assistance will respond to these needs by reviewing key smart grid technologies and integrated solutions, drafting relevant technical standards for specific technologies, drafting overall policy and regulatory requirements/standards, and developing approaches for coordination with industry and consumers.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected for this activity will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$442,380 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>

(6)  Cadastral Survey knowledge, records research, and resolution of conflicting evidence:  Discuss your firm’s knowledge of cadastral survey practices, records research and the approach you have used on previous surveys to resolve problems resulting from conflicting title or physical evidence.

The machinery control system is being installed as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and will be the main focus of the availability alterations. Another large set of alterations are the habmod requirements. The installation of a fully functional prototype Heavy UNREP System for Station No. 6 and backbone equipment for Station 12 (not functional) are also major alterations. The alterations are to enhance operational and control characteristics and consolidate disparate monitoring systems.</p>
<p>The ship particulars are as follows:<br />USNS ARCTIC (T-AOE-8)<br />Length Overall - 753 FT. - 8 &frac12; IN<br />Max Beam - 107 FT. - 0 IN<br />Full Load Displacement -53,000 LT</p>

<p>Questions for Industry:</p>
<p>Please prepare a capabilities statement to address the foregoing and at a minimum the items enumerated below:</p>
<p>(1) Is the shipyard's dry-dock currently NAVSEA certified? If not, what certification does it currently hold? Has it ever been NAVSEA certified in the past?</p>
<p>(2) This availability is currently anticipated to have a period of performance of approximately 270 beginning on/about 12 January 2012. The dry-docking will be restricted to the first 60 days of the availability. Is your dry-dock available in this timeframe? Do you have the capacity to manage this size availability given other workload anticipated for this same timeframe?</p>
<p>(3) The machinery control system will be replaced during this availability by a Government Contractor. The shipyard will be responsible for removing the existing control consoles and supporting GFE installation. The time frame to accomplish this removal is within the first 60 days of the overhaul. What if any experience does the shipyard have with this type of work with imposed time frames of this sort?</p>
<p>(4) A large alteration in this package is the installation of a new Heavy UNREP system for Station 6 which will be a fully functional prototype. The Station 12 Heavy UNREP requirements are a "backbone" of equipment which will have to be modified in the future to become functional. The Heavy Unrep alterations will require removal of machinery and installation of foundations and equipment while the ship is on dock to support installation and testing schedules. Also, significant pier testing will be required once the installation is completed by the shipyard. How has your shipyard tested new UNREP systems in the past? Can your facilities accommodate the stretch testing required for completion of this work? A guide to testing is provided as Enclosure (1).</p>
<p>(5) This procurement will be solicited under NAICS 336611, Ship Building and Repair. Please indicate your business size status for this NAICS. Is your company a large or small business, and if a small business, do you fall within any of the further classifications (Hubzone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.)</p>
<p>Please provide your response to this Request for Information by COB 23 February 2011. Submissions should be made by email to Reyn.Schuttler@Navy.Mil. MSC has limitations on file sizes, so if the attached files are larger than a total of 3M, please submit via separate emails. Submission of a capabilities statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Government as to the extent of shipyards available for this procurement. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice.</p>

<CONTACT>Susan Messina, Contracting Officer, Phone 571-227-4055, Email susan.messina@dhs.gov
<DESC>Subject: Request for Information (RFI) to support the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Security Technology, Checkpoint Efficiency.
<p>1. DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is currently conducting market research to determine if products currently exist to create efficiencies within the checkpoint environment. This RFI does not constitute a future contract and vendors shall not be compensated for providing information. TSA is currently performing a market survey to determine if vendors exist that can meet the following concepts. <br /><br />The two concepts that are being investigated are the following:<br /><br />Automation of Passenger Flow<br /><br />Data identification and correlation<br /><br />Specifically, TSA seeks to obtain (1) information about solutions based on vendor experience in environments similar to TSA, (2) information about products and services offered by industry that provides a turn key solution that meets the above concept(s), and (3) suggestions on alternative approaches to minimize total life cycle cost.</p>
<p>Background: TSA is responsible for "protecting the Nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce." The proposed concept are initiatives being investigated by TSA that incorporates hardware and software in order to move toward a process improvement solution.</p>
<p>There are over 12,000 pieces of airport security equipment installed nationwide including Advanced Imaging Technologies (AIT), AT X-ray, Explosive Trace Detectors and Electronic Metal Detectors (EMD). Passengers currently arrive at a checkpoint and traverse the checkpoint process. This includes divesting items from their person and carry-on items. Their carry-on items and divested items pass through the AT X-ray while the passenger passes through either the AIT or EMD.</p>
<p>The concept that is being investigated includes the following properties: <br /><br />&bull; Provide automated flow of passengers through the process identified above</p>
<p>&bull; Identify and correlate data for systems and processes;</p>
<p>&bull; Be mindful of space constraints within the common checkpoint environment</p>
<p>&bull; Identify hardware/software for identification of data</p>
<p>2. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Vendors should refer to the DHS website at www.dhs.gov and the TSA website at www.tsa.gov for information about the TSA mission, organization, locations, customer services, and current initiatives.</p>
<p>3. RESPONSES TO THE RFI</p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis announcement and IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.  The Government will NOT reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this synopsis.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this synopsis.<BR><BR>USACE-AES plans to solicit offers for the award of base Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), which will serve to support the Construction and Design-Build of multiple projects/facilities in support of Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) facilities requirements in southern and western Afghanistan, often incorporating a specialty construction method requiring contractors to construct K-span (rolled metal arch) buildings.  <BR><BR>USACE-AES intends to award up to seven (7) contracts under this MATOC.  Each contract will include a 2-year base period (not-to-exceed (NTE) 24 months) and three, one-year option periods (NTE 12 months each).  The total period of performance will not exceed five years.  The total capacity of the MATOC will be $499,999,000.00.  While the Government contemplates awarding a target of seven MATOCs, it reserves the right to award more, less, or none at all.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The small business size standard is $33.5 Million.  The magnitude of construction for the basic MATOCs are estimated to be between $100,000,000.00 and $250,000,000.00.  The magnitude of construction for the individual Task Orders are estimated to be between $5,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00.<BR><BR>Individual design/build or construction efforts will be solicited from MATOC awardees and awarded by task order in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1), Fair Opportunity.  When issued, the solicitation will include one actual task order which will also be awarded.  Task orders will be firm-fixed-price for construction and design-build efforts in support of a full range of projects in various locations throughout the AES Area of Responsibility (AOR).  <BR><BR>Task Orders issued under this MATOC contract will primarily address new construction, design-build (D-B) , design-bid-build (D-B-B), site-adapt-construction (S-A-C) (which is design-build using bridging documents), multi-story construction, barracks, dining facilities, utilities and infrastructure construction, general building renovation, security, perimeters, new road construction, and general environmental work including but not limited to, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical and concrete work, etc.  Task orders will primarily include Afghan National Security Force (ANSF) construction and D-B projects, but may also include Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) and Military Construction (MILCON) projects involving a variety of trades, in the region.  <BR><BR>A project similar to the following description will be used to evaluate offers and serve as the first awarded Task Order.  This Task Order will be for the design, materials, labor, and equipment to construct buildings, utilities and other infrastructure for the expansion of a Corps and Brigade Garrison, located in the Afghanistan AOR, to include all facilities to be constructed with applicable drawings.   The task order may include design and construction of a courthouse, military police (MP) administration and/or training buildings, facilities for a Military Intelligence (MI) Kandak, four Kandak training buildings, and two literacy classrooms, for a design end population of approximately 600 personnel.  The buildings included in the sample project will be constructed using CMU and K-Span construction methods.  Final design drawings of most facilities, site work, construction, and related designs would be accomplished by the Contractor.  The magnitude of construction for this Task Order is estimated to be between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. <BR><BR>The point-of-contact for this procurement is Raquel Blankenhorn, Contract Specialist, USACE-AES, APO AE 09355.

<a href="mailto:aragon.n.liebzeit@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Walla Walla</a>
<DESC><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Walla Walla District has a requirement for a Performance Oriented Construction Activities (POCA) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple-Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) with capability to award design build construction projects.  <BR><BR>The purpose of the MATOC is to provide a variety of public works design and construction services including but not limited to the following:  repair and maintenance of real property, environmental work, incidental services, force protection work, property repair and maintenance, habitat restoration (environmental work), new construction, and renovation. <BR> <BR>Use of the MATOC provides a construction product delivery method that utilizes industry innovation, can accommodate quick and straight-forward projects, as well as some small but complex projects, can help minimize design effort and related overhead expenditures, as well as handle compressed schedules while reducing acquisition-related lead time.  Projects may range from those where the government provides full design (Design-Bid-Build) to those with limited design and functional specifications requiring the contractor to complete the design and construct the project.  <BR><BR>This procurement is an SBA certified HUBZone Small-Business set-aside.  The primary NAICS code for work under this procurement is 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction) with a small business size standard of $33.5 million.  This requirement will be awarded using a Best Value, two-phase design-build process in accordance with FAR 15.101-1 and FAR Subpart 36.3.  <BR><BR>Two solicitations will be issued in sequence consisting of a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) during Phase One and a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Phase Two.  <BR><BR>In Phase One an RFQ will be issued requesting qualification proposals from interested HUBZone firms based on the overall MATOC scope of work.  Not more than the seven (7) most qualified firms will be selected to submit Phase Two proposals based on the following Phase One evaluation criteria:  design-build experience, past performance, and management approach. <BR><BR>No pre-proposal conference/site visit will be conducted during Phase One.  <BR><BR>The Phase One Request for Qualifications will be issued on or about February 18, 2011-not less than 15 days from the date this notice is posted.  <BR><BR>In Phase Two, an RFP will be issued to up to the seven (7) most qualified offeror's selected in Phase One.  The RFP will include the scope of work for the first Task Order, Task Order 0001, to be awarded under this contract(s).    <BR> <BR>Phase One evaluations of qualification proposals will not be utilized in the Phase Two trade-off evaluations and Best Value determinations.  All contract requirements will be detailed in the RFP using the USACE Contract Format consisting of the following sections:  00010- Solicitation/Contract Form, 00100-Schedule/Instruction to Offerors/Evaluation Factors for Award, 00600C-Representations and Certifications, 00700-Contract Clauses, 00800-Special Contract Requirements, 01000-Division 1/General Requirements, and 16999-Division 2-16/Technical Provisions. <BR><BR>A pre-proposal conference/site visit may be conducted during Phase Two.<BR><BR>Phase Two offerors will have not less than 30 days to provide their proposals.  Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of a technical and price proposal based on the aforementioned Task Order 0001 project. <BR> <BR>Proposals received in response to the Phase Two RFP will be evaluated in accordance with source selection procedures outlined in FAR 15.305.  Up to four (4) MATOC contract awards will be made to the offerors whose total evaluated price and technical proposal provide the best value to the Government.  Only one firm will be awarded the first Task Order (Task Order 0001) as a result of this RFP.   <BR>  <BR>It is the Government's intent to award up to four (4) IDIQ contracts to the offeror(s) whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value.  Task Orders will be awarded on a firm-fixed price basis.  The value of each Task Order is expected to primarily be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), $150,000, but the Government reserves the right to issue Task Orders valued up to $500,000.<BR>  <BR>MATOC Scope of Work <BR>A.	Performance Period:  One year base period and three twelve-month option periods.<BR>B.	Maximum Contract Value:  The total dollar capacity shared between firms will not exceed $6 million dollars.  The annual aggregate amount is estimated at $1,500,000.  Any unused capacity in one period may be carried over into the subsequent contract period.  <BR>C.	Minimum Guarantee:  The minimum guarantee amount for the entire life of the contract for each IDIQ awardee is $10,000.<BR>D.	Task Order Limitations:  The minimum Task Order value is $2,000 and the maximum Task Order value is limited to $500,000.<BR><BR>General:  Task Orders will primarily address general public works construction and renovation including but not limited to the following:  dams, roads and pavement construction and repair, general environmental work, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete work, environmental remedial work and other presently unforeseeable requirements that may arise.  Projects will generally be design-build, requiring some element of design for various construction types, but may include projects in which the Government provides a full design.  The awarded IDIQ's will not be utilized for AE design only requirements that do not involve constructing the completed design.  Task Orders may be issued for construction work in which no design is required.  Task Order projects may be non-complex performance oriented tasks requiring minimal design, or they may be complex construction Task Orders requiring design development for design-build construction, or a combination thereof.  Task Order Proposal Requests (TOPR) may or may not include traditional plans and specifications or may include sketches and other informational submittals. <BR><BR>"Design-Build" is defined for solicitation purposes as a project in which the contractor is provided less than a full design and is required to complete the design.  This includes participating in design review and total construction of the designed project. <BR><BR>Placement of Task Orders:  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by a USACE Contracting Officer who will issue written Task Orders to the IDIQ awardees.  Prices will be requested and evaluated for each Task Order in accordance with FAR 16.505.  Each individual TOPR will state the evaluation criteria for Task Order award.  Individual Task Order awards may be evaluated on price only or price and other non-cost evaluation factors as outlined in the TOPR.  Whenever possible, award will be made without discussions. <BR><BR>Area of Responsibility:  The MATOC work will primarily be geographically located throughout the Walla Walla District area of operations, principally Washington, and work concentrated at Mc Nary (Washington and Oregon), Ice Harbor, Little Goose, Lower Monumental, Lower Granite, Dworshak (Orofino, Idaho) and Lucky Peak (Boise, Idaho) Dams.  The Walla Walla District's civil works boundaries generally follow the Snake River drainage and include approximately 107,000 square miles in six states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, and small parts of Nevada and Utah.  Work may include additional project locations within the Pacific Northwest covered by USACE Seattle and Portland Districts.  The Government reserves the right to issue additional solicitations and award additional contracts for the same or similar work within the area covered by this MATOC.  This is not a solicitation for a Requirements Contract.  <BR><BR>Task Order 0001:  The Government intends to award Task Order 0001 for the design completion and electrification of the storage building at Ice Harbor Lock and Dam concurrently with the MATOC awards.  The project includes minor construction consisting of electrical design completion and interior electrical construction.  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of this first Task Order is between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00.  This Task Order will be awarded on the basis of price and technical criteria. <BR> <BR>Award of the first IDIQ and Task Order 0001 will be made to the Offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best overall value to the Government based on the evaluated ratings from the Phase Two proposals. The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer or to reject all offers. The Government will not award a contract to an Offeror whose proposal contains a deficiency, as defined in FAR 15.001. <BR><BR>The Contracting Officer will award the subsequent IDIQ contracts to the Offerors whose proposals are considered to represent the remaining best value to the Government based on the evaluated ratings from Phase Two. <BR><BR>Joint Ventures (JV)<BR>A joint venture is defined as follows:  a legal business entity formed between two or more companies (parties) to undertake the performance activities of a contract together.  This does not include other arrangements such as "teaming agreements" or "strategic alliance", which are not recognized as bona fide joint ventures for the purposes of this solicitation.  <BR><BR>A company that is part of a joint venture must submit a legally binding joint venture agreement.  The Government will not evaluate the capability of any contractors that are not included in the joint venture agreement.  Joint ventures must include a copy of the legal joint venture agreement signed by an authorized officer from each of the firms comprising the joint venture with the chief executive of each entity identified.<BR><BR>If submitting a proposal as a joint venture, the experience, past performance, and management plan of each of the joint venture partners can be submitted for the joint venture entity.  The experience for each joint venture partner will be considered the experience of the joint venture entity.  Page and project form limits apply to the joint venture as a whole.  Prospective Offerors that submit Phase One proposals may not change their firm (including LOC's and proposed sub-contractors) or their Joint Venture firms, if selected to submit Phase Two proposals.  <BR><BR>Credit for Subcontractor Experience; Letter of Commitment (LOC)<BR>If an Offeror wishes to be credited with a subcontractor or supplier, i.e. a firm that is not the prime contractor or part of the joint venture, a letter of commitment signed by the subcontractor and the prime contractor must be submitted.  The commitment letter must be submitted even if the firm is in some way related to a joint venture partner (for example, the subcontractor is subsidiary of a joint venture partner, or a subsidiary of a firm to which the joint venture partner is also a subsidiary).  In regard to Experience, if an Offeror submits projects demonstrating experience in one of the factors, and that project was completed by a subcontractor, a subsidiary, or a supplier, as opposed to the prime or one of the joint venture partners, the Offeror MUST submit a signed letter of commitment from the contractor who performed and completed the work.  If a letter of commitment is not submitted, the experience will not be considered.  Prospective Offerors that submit Phase One proposals may not change their firm (including LOC's and proposed sub-contractors) or their Joint Venture firms, if selected to submit Phase Two proposals. <BR> <BR>NOTE:  The closing date annotated on the pre-solicitation notice via FedBizOpps is for FedBizOpps archiving purpose only.  <BR>
