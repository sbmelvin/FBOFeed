GENERAL 1A	Description of Work Contractor will aerially treat emergent and invasive plant species at specified work sites with chemical controls to improve irrigation efficiency.  The vegetation to be treated include dense stands of cattails and bulrushes, isolated upland pockets of perennial pepperweed, and satellite populations of common reed. 1B	Location of Work All spraying activities will take place in two areas, both of which are located in the Blitzen Valley south of refuge headquarters.  The Buena Vista and P Ranch areas are approximately 40 miles and 60 miles south of Burns, Oregon, respectively.  1C	Access to Project Areas For this contract, standard access is defined as passable with a semi and trailer necessary to haul a helicopter to a site where lift-off, landing, and tank filling activities can be carried out safely and efficiently.  The cost of standard access is to be included in the unit bid price.  Water is available at the P Ranch and Buena Vista substations.  These locations are not available for refilling aircraft, however.  All hauling expenses to launch sites should be accounted for in the per acre bid. 2	DEFINITIONS "	EPA:		Environmental Protection Agency "	PAR:		Pesticide Application Report Record "	PPE:		Personal Protective Equipment "	PUP:		Pesticide Use Proposal "	Refuge:	Malheur National Wildlife Refuge "	CGS:		Contract and General Services 3	SCOPE This contract guarantees the spraying of 1400 acres, of which approximately 140 acres will involve spot-spraying isolated patches of common reed (Phragmites australis), 350 acres will involve spot-spraying perennial pepperweed (perennial pepperweed).  The remaining acres will consist of treating large blocks of emergents such as cattails and bulrushes.   3A	Application of Herbicides Contractor shall dispose of empty containers off-refuge in accordance with label requirements. All treatment locations will be documented with a Trimble Global Positioning System (GPS) or equal unit.  GPS protocol will be agreed upon by the Contractor and Habitat Program Manager. The following chemicals will be used in this contract: Aquatic glyphosate (Rodeo, Aquaneat, etc.): For treatment of common reed and general emergent vegetation.  All applications must be in accordance with the chemical label and refuge PUP.  Include an appropriate nonionic surfactant such as Syl-tac (1 pint per 100 gallons) in all estimated costs. 	Application rate: 6 pints/acre Escort: For treatment of perennial pepperweed.  All applications must be in accordance with the chemical label and refuge PUP.  Include an appropriate nonionic surfactant such as Syl-tac (1 pint per 100 gallons) in all estimated costs. 	Application rate: 1 oz/acre * It is important to note that chemicals will not be provided by the refuge and must be included in per acre estimates.   Multiple staging sites may be required depending on the preferences of the applicator.   The project involves two units (Buena Vista and P Ranch), approximately 10 miles apart, involving roughly half of the total acreage for each unit. The spraying window is based plant physiology factors and lies between June 15 and July 15, 2006.   3B	Application Prerequisites Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, supervision, transportation, and incidentals necessary for herbicide application and associated activities in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications herein. 3C	Personal Protective Equipment Contractor shall provide relevant PPE equipment and will ensure that it is used in accordance with pertinent herbicide labels. 3D	State/Federal Qualifications Contractor must hold appropriate applicator licenses that include an aquatic category.  All herbicide applications must be made in accordance with pertinent federal, state, and local regulations.    Proof of license must be presented to the Contracting Officer before any Award of Contract will be made. 4	PLACE/DELIVERY AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE All spraying will take place on Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as detailed above.  The total amount of acres that are funded through this contract will be treated during the specified window. Spraying activities must take place in 2006 during the one month period between June 15 and July 15.  Spraying can be postponed until June 15 through July 15, 2007 if unforeseen circumstances prevent spraying in 2006. 5.	INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE The U.S. Government will make periodic inspections as a basis for acceptance        	and payment.  The Contractor is encouraged to observe inspections while they   	are being made.  The Contractor will coordinate with the Habitat Program    	Manager on any herbicides applied to the project sites.  The Habitat Program    	Manager will make verbal approval before applications take place at each site.     	A Project Inspector may be assigned to observe applications.  For projects    	treated in the absence of a Project Inspector, the Refuge may inspect these      	treatment sites within 60 to 80 days after the date of application.  If a random    	inspection of 10% of the sites does not reflect that 80% of the plants within the    	treated area have been impacted by the herbicides, all treated sites shall be    	inspected.  If inspections of all treated areas with each site reflect an impacted    	rate of less than 80%, the Contractor shall be required to treat the plants missed    	at no additional cost to the   Refuge. All invoices sent to the refuge should be accompanied by the following treatment documentation: 1.	Billing statements listing the number and location of treated acres and  charge rates per acre (including travel, administration, per-diem, and other labor-related expenses). 2.	Tank mix information indicating date of activity, mix ratios (water, surfactant, herbicide, etc.), and acres per tank treatment. 	Billing statements should also include the contract number assigned by CGS. 6. 	GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT OR MATERIALS/INFORMATION: 	No government furnished equipment is required.   7.	AVAILABILITY Normal duty hours are 7:00 am to 4:30 pm from Monday thru Thursday and 7:00 am to 3:30 pm on Friday.  In the event of emergencies, the contractor shall provide contact information.  Because of the time of year, air temperatures can negatively impact lift and thermals, thus reducing the amount of time aerial spraying takes place on any given day.  Mosquitoes are also quite bad and can impact the effectiveness of ground crews if appropriate protective measures are not taken. Because bird populations are high in the Blitzen Valley, they could present a significant collision risk. 8.	TECHNICAL COORDINATOR Questions/ communications regarding the work should be directed to Jess Wenick, Habitat Program Manager, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 36391 Sodhouse Lane, Princeton, OR 97721.  Phone: (541) 493-2612.

Exeter, NH for the purchase of 300 Sig Sauer P229 Pistols and 600 P228/P229 13rd Magazines.  SIGARMS is the sole manufacturer of the aforementioned items.  The Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol is a unique system that our armorers have been certified to repair and DS agents have been trained to use which presents a legal liability issue.  The U.S. Department of State cannot utilize multiple systems for our weapons for the above reasons. The DS Firearms Policy and Review Board has approved the use of the Sig Sauer as the ONLY pistol authorized for use by DS agents.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items that what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons systems to issue to the various mission locations overseas and domestic.  Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol specifications are as follows:  Overall length: 7.1 inches, Overall height: 5.4 inches, Overall Width: 1.5 inches, Barrel length: 3.9 inches, Weight w/o mag: 28.1 oz, Mag weight: 3.0 oz, Sight radius: 5.7 inches.

Since the background investigation and badging processes can take several weeks to complete, we would like to start the process for the potential offerors on this procurement now, before the RFP is issued.

<DESC>THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, LETTER-WRITTEN, OR FAXED REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION (RFP) FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  Instead, all prospective offerors (bidders) MUST obtain the Solicitation from the FedBizOpps website, whose address is:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov .  The Pre-Solicitation Notice (Synopsis) that you are now reading is NOT the Solicitation; the Solicitation will be published HEREAFTER in this SAME FedBizOpps website.  The procurement announced in this Pre-Solicitation Notice is FULL-AND-OPEN-COMPETITIVE, and it will be a FOLLOW-ON project.  In performing this follow-on project, the contractor will create an open systems design for transmitting E9-1-1 calls from most types of communications devices, will demonstrate a working proof of concept showing coordinated performance among the system’s components, and will prepare a plan for transitioning from disparate 9-1-1 systems to an IP environment in a national next generation system (or “system of systems”).   For this follow-on project, the FHWA plans to award one and only one cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, which will have a two-year Period of Performance and NO task orders.   The INCUMBENT contractor is the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), located at Suite 750, 4350 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1695.  Under that incumbent contract, numbered DTFH61-02-C-00015 and entitled “Facilitating the Implementation of Emergency Wireless Communications”, NENA, since October of 2001, has been working toward a goal of developing the necessary tools, technical guidance, and training and outreach materials to facilitate implementation of wireless E9-1-1 services throughout the 50 states.  However, the follow-on project synopsized here is MORE than just a simple CONTINUATION of the work done by NENA and should be considered separate and distinct form the work completed by NENA.  For example, the key operational capabilities of the NG9-1-1 system that will be developed under this FOLLOW-ON project will enable E9-1-1 calls from any networked communication device, as well as geographic-independent call access, transfer, and backup among Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) and between PSAPs and other authorized emergency organizations.  The systems architecture specifications that will be developed in this FOLLOW-ON project will require the 9-1-1 system to transition from analog to digital and from landline to Internet-based Protocols.   In short, in this FOLLOW-ON project a fundamental reexamination of the technological approach to 9-1-1 is required for the public safety emergency network adaptations to accommodate the challenges of wireless communications.   NENA IS eligible to COMPETE for the follow-on project announced in this Pre-Solicitation Notice.  NENA’s point of contact is Mr. Robert Cobb, who can be reached at the following e-mail address: bcobb@nena.org.  Although telephone numbers for NENA and for Mr. Cobb are obtainable on the Internet, prospective offerors for this follow-on project who wish to contact NENA are asked to use Mr. Cobb’s e-mail address rather than calling him.  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for copies of NENA’s INCUMBENT contract document are unlikely to be fruitful for organizations wishing to compete for this FOLLOW-ON project, for the following reasons:  (a) the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) routinely REDACTS, from contract documents furnished to FOIA requesters, all pricing data and all staffing data; (b) the Statement of Work that will be published hereafter in the Solicitation (RFP) for this FOLLOW-ON project will be self-contained and will stand alone and will DIFFER in many crucial respects from the Statement of Work set forth in NENA’s INCUMBENT contract document; (c) any attempt, by an offeror submitting a proposal for this follow-on project, to respond to the INCUMBENT contract’s Statement of Work would almost certainly call into serious question the offeror’s grasp of, and commitment to attaining, the technical objectives of this follow-on project; and (d) given the time-consuming procedure governing the FHWA’s processing of FOIA requests, it is unlikely that even an extensively redacted and probably useless copy of NENA’s INCUMBENT contract document could be made available to any FOIA requester before the due date for submitting PROPOSALS under this follow-on procurement.  The contractor performing this follow-on project will develop technical specifications and a transition plan for implementing a nationwide NG9-1-1 system.  Using a systems engineering approach, the contractor for this follow-on project will develop and validate requirements for the NG9-1-1 system, will define a system architecture, and will demonstrate a proof-of-concept prototype.  The contractor for this follow-on project will evaluate the system to determine how it supports emergency call initiation, routing, and processing that will ultimately fulfill public safety emergency response information needs.  In parallel to the engineering and test phases, the contractor for this follow-on project will develop an operationally and institutionally feasible transition plan for migrating today’s 9-1-1 system to a nationwide internetwork capable of managing emergency calls from most types of communications devices.  Production system deployment is NOT expected within this follow-on project.  It is estimated that the performance of this two-year follow-on project will require a total of 837 labor-hours to be worked by ONE Program Manager, who must be NAMED in each offeror’s INITIALLY-submitted written proposal for this follow-on project.  The Program Manager SHALL possess a technical degree and at least 15 years of experience in the research, development and application of emergency communications technologies, and shall possess at least five years of experience in managing a group of engineers in this field; but that five years of managerial experience could overlap with, or be contained within, the 15 years of research and development experience.  The Program Manager SHALL possess skills and knowledge that include systems engineering and integration, state/local 9-1-1 operations, emergency response operations, traditional 9-1-1 network technology and services, IP-network technology and operations, traditional telecommunications services, other IT / telecommunication application services, and IP-network access infrastructure and services.  It is further estimated that this follow-on project will require a total of 1,988 labor-hours to be worked by ONE Project Leader, who must be NAMED in an offeror’s INITIALLY-submitted written proposal for this follow-on project.  The Project Leader must have a degree, but a non-technical degree (e.g., a J. D. or a B. A. or a B. S. or an MBA) could substitute for a technical degree.  The Project Leader’s background shall be similar to that of the Program Manager, except that the Project Leader must possess a minimum of only seven years of experience in the research, development and application of emergency communications technologies, and the Project Leader must possess a minimum of only two years of experience in managing a group of engineers in this field.  It is also estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 6,030 labor-hours to be worked by MORE than one individual serving in Senior Level Staff positions.  Each particular Senior Level Staff person must be NAMED in an offeror’s INITIALLY-submitted written proposal for this follow-on project.  Each particular Senior Level Staff person shall possess five or more years of experience in systems engineering and integration, state / local 9-1-1 operations, emergency response operations, traditional 9-1-1 network technology and services, IP-network technology and operations, traditional telecommunications services, other IT / telecommunication application services, and IP-network access infrastructure and services, and shall have a technical degree, preferably related to one of the following disciplines:  systems engineering; electrical engineering; computer science; management information systems; or economics.  Additionally, it is estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 9,460 labor-hours to be worked by MORE than one individual serving in Mid-Level Staff positions.  Each particular Mid-Level staff person SHALL possess two or more years of experience in technical areas related to NG9-1-1, and SHOULD have a related technical degree.  Also, it is estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 8,430 labor-hours to be worked by MORE than one individual serving in Junior Level Staff positions.  Each particular Junior Level Staff person SHALL possess a degree relevant to transportation management or ITS and shall be capable of performing analyses, research, and the evaluation of technical products.  Finally, it is estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 1,155 labor-hours for Administrative Support persons.   Each individual proposed as an Administrative Support Staff person shall have skills in word processing, graphical illustration, desktop publishing and mailing list software, and shall have the ability to turn products of technical staff into documents and presentations of specified formats and of high quality, including camera-ready copy for publications, and the ability to distribute such materials promptly to mailing lists of reviewers and participants.    Each proposed Administrative Support Staff member shall possess at least one year of work experience in rendering general office support, but such experience need not necessarily be in a transportation-related field.   Each proposed Administrative Support Staff member shall, at a minimum, possess an associate’s degree in any field, whether related to this 9-1-1 project or not.   THE DUE DATE FOR THE FHWA’S RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS, AS PUBLISHED IN THIS PRE-S0LICITATION NOTICE, IS ONLY AN ESTIMATED DUE DATE.  THE ACTUAL DUE DATE FOR THE FHWA’S RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS WILL BE STATED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SOLICITATION (RFP) HEREAFTER PUBLISHED IN THIS SAME FedBizOpps WEBSITE.  The FHWA’s best current ESTIMATE is that the Solicitation MIGHT be published in this FedBizOpps website on or about May 19, 2006.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS) is conducting a market survey to determine industry’s capability to provide Modular Non-Live Fire Combined Arms Mobilized Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT) at Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command (MAGTFTC), Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms, California. The scope of the effort entails performing a mix of design, fabrication, installation, integration, verification and fielding of the Combined Arms MOUT.   Extensive studies by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory have shown that units that are trained to operate an integrated combined arms team are more successful within the urban battle space and suffer fewer casualties.  With this in mind and given the nature of operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the requirement to train battalion sized forces is critical.  This training is required to ensure Marines are properly trained prior to deployment for real world operations in Iraq.  Facilities are required in order for the Marine Corps to conduct quality and credible battalion level force-on-force MOUT training.   The non-live fire Combined Arms MOUT facilities will primarily be used for company and battalion force-on-force fire and maneuver training using SESAMs ammunition and MILES gear within an urban terrain!   facility. As part of this presolicitation, a DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT RFP for Industry will be released within ten days of this posting, in the form of an amendment.  Interested vendors should supply comments to the documents indicating ability to meet specified requirements, specific items requiring clarification for responsive industry proposal.  Received comments will be considered by the Government for basis of modification to the subject documents.  Comments will not be directly responded to but may be addressed collectively at a future date during or prior to solicitation. These documents and all future documents are available for download from the PM TRASYS website, Business Opportunities Division at: http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/trasys/trasysweb.nsf/  In addition, the Government intends to hold a Pre-Solicitation Conference and Site Visit at Twentynine Palms, CA on 17 May 2006.  Further information will be contained in a DRAFT RFP to be released prior to the Pre-Solicitation Conference.   Due to range policy and safety regulations, anyone attending the Pre-Solicitation Conference who plans to attend the Site Visit shall have a four-wheel drive vehicle with spare tire and jack.  Anyone without a four-wheel drive vehicle will not be allowed beyond main side of MAGTFTC.   This request for information in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the US Government for information or materials provided.  It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.   All information provided becomes USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  All interested potential offerors shall submit an email request to Ms. Sandi Brubaker and Ms. Judy L. Volk to be placed on bidders list for future correspondence and documentation.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for an Infinite Portable Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) Arm that will be used to take metrology measurements in the field.  In addition to the infinite portable CMM arm, NASA/KSC requires the following associated components (quantity of 1 each): (a) laptop computer; (b) battery charger (c) 7.2 V Li-ion battery; (d) PC-DMIS 3.7 Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Manual Software Package; (e) PC-DMIS CAD Training; (f) Brunson Stand Model 231; (g) Brunson laptop support arm and tray; (h) sheet metal option. NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from CimCore Corporation.  KSC’s Metrology Laboratory (ML) has identified CimCore as the only known responsible source to complete the requirement based on instrument compatibility and software conformity with existing instruments already in use at KSC.  The ML’s existing CMMs contain proprietary hardware and software developed by CimCore.  Moreover, the ML maintains an extensive inventory of spare parts for maintenance of the instruments.  To ensure compatibility via the interchangeability of parts with current inventory, it would be impractical to introduce a non-compatible CMM to the ML’s current structure. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, May 2, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: 

(1) Overall scientific and/or technical merit, including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational approach;

(2) The effort's potential contribution and relevance to the National Intelligence Community's Information Assurance requirements, 

(3) Approach for evaluation of the technology; 

(4) The prospect for effective transfer of technology produced into the Intelligence Community; and 

(5) The reasonableness and realism of: proposed costs, fee (if any), and program milestones/schedule. 

Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate and the Disruptive Technology Office (DTO) has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

The Government may use the services of Omen Inc., Scitor Corp, Booz Allen Hamilton, Teknoworks, Mitre, and Institute for Defense Analysis personnel in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of proposals. The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government. Representatives of the foregoing firm(s) participating in the evaluation process will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. Any objection to the use of any or all the personnel identified above must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.


VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is presenting a pre-proposal meeting for the next phase of its academic computational science program that will focus on the goal of “Predictive Science.”  
The program, called Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program (PSAAP), will be funded by NNSA’s Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) program and coordinated with the three NNSA National Laboratories (Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia).  PSAAP is the third cycle of the program, and builds from the ASC Academic Strategic Alliances Program (ASAP). In the first two cycles, ASAP helped the university partners develop multi-departmental teams that defined the forefront of academic multi-scale computational science.  The goal is to have impacts on the academic community as ASAP did, with computational science emerging as a discipline integrated into the universities’ educational efforts and enabling fundamental research advancements across multiple disciplines.
The PSAAP program pre-proposal meeting will be held May 16-17, 2006 to announce the Request for Information (RFI) phase of the program, to present the background on PSAAP, and to discuss with interested proposers the science areas and application domains of particular interests to NNSA. The competition is expected to culminate with awards in place by the beginning of FY08.
Further details on the May 2006 pre-proposal meeting, the program itself and draft RFI can be found at the PSAAP web site, http://www.llnl.gov/asci/alliances/psaap.

The National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB) Cancer Array Informatics Project (caArray) is seeking a Subcontractor with adequate database support, domain knowledge in microarray, technical leadership, and program management services.  These service professionals will work in concert with the NCICB appointed caArray Project Manager.  These experts must have had previous experience in: microarray databases and related software, n-tier architecture and design; Java and database application development, software and data model design; and robust software development methodology that optimizes for high quality deliverables.  The Subcontractor will include test plan development, software quality assurance procedures, and professional project management activities in its planning and execution. Details included in the attached Request For Proposal (RFP).

 

Background:

 

The (NCICB) cancer array informatics project, caArray, consists of a microarray database and data analysis and visualization tools. CaArray is an open source project, and the source code and APIs are available from the caArray Informatics page. The caArray project provides NCI intramural and extramural researchers with technologies to efficiently store, retrieve, and analyze cancer gene expression data.  The caArray project supports several NCI-funded programs, including caBIG, SPOREs, MMHCC, and the NCI Director’s Challenge.

 

The caArray project includes the implementation and deployment of a microarray repository that is accessible via a web portal and programmatic APIs.  The caArray platform allows researchers to submit and retrieve gene expression data.  Data persisted in the caArray database can be analyzed using NCICB as well as third-party analysis tools. The application is clearly divided into front end, middle tier and back ends. All of experiment annotation data is entered via the front end portal and persisted in the database. Array design (MAGE-ML for Affymetrix Array designs, Gal files for GenePix) are also parsed and stored into the caArray database. Experiment data files (CEL and CHP files for Affymetrix and GPR for GenePix Result Format) are converted into Net CDF format for faster access to individual spot values and stored on the server file system (Network Common Data Form http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ ). The original file (experiment data file) is also archived on the file server. All writes to the back end via the data access middle tier, which utilizes OJB and EJB for persisting into the database. 

 

The caArray 1.3.1 release involved the initial development of core caArray functionality.  This functionality included support for microarray data submission and retrieval based on industry standards for microarray data.  These standards included the Microarray Gene Expression Object Model (MAGE-OM), Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME), and terminologies defined by the Microarray Gene Expression Data Society (MGED) Ontology development effort. The caArray 1.3.1 release supports MGED Ontology version

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The following are the responses to questions regarding this solicitation.  Question:  What does electronic services reference (types of services, projects, personnel) and in what nature should a contractor approach this in the submittal? Response:  The term electronic has been removed from this section.  Question:  Is the maximum number of example projects 10 or will the primes example projects be 10 and include additional example projects for subs.  This requirement varies between distri cts. Response:  Since a specific number of projects are not specified, the maximum number of projects is 10, inclusive of subcontractors.   Question:  May proposal responses for Solicitation W911WN-06-R-0012 be hand delivered on the due date of May 5, 2006?  Response:  Yes.  The location is the same as noted in the synopsis; USACE Contracting is located on the 21st Floor.  The proposal must be  delivered by the specified time and date.  Question:  Under the Submission section of the above-referenced solicitation, it states use no smaller than 12 font type.  When preparing our SF 330 in response to this solicitation, is this a requirement for all  330 sections, i.e. the Section E Resume?  Response:  Yes  Question:  In review of the recent advertisement in Fed Biz Ops we noticed the requirement under Paragraph 4. that the font be no smaller than 12 pitch. Does that include the forms and input to them, or is that just for Section H ? Also is the 125 page lim itation under the same paragraph including the Part II submittals for the prime and subs, or just for Part I , Sections A thru H ? Do the covers and divider pages count as well?  Response:  The input to the Form must be 12 pitch.  The total combined submis sion, inclusive of Part I and part II, shall not exceed 125 pages.  Covers and dividers pages will not count.  Question:  With regards to subcontracting opportunities, can a list of interested parties be developed?  Response:  Interested firms that are pla nning to submit a proposal may provide their contact information to Mr. Costantino (information provided in the synopsis).   A list will be compiled and posted to the FedBiz announcement at a later date.  Question:  The solicitation requests the services o f Electronic Engineering.  How do the services provided by Electronic Engineering differ from the services of Electrical Engineering also requested?  Response:  See above. Question:  In the original synopsis, section g of the Selection Criteria states g) Location of the firm in the general geographic area of the Pittsburgh District.  Is there yet a preference for firms with offices located in the Pittsburgh District? Respons e:  The original synopsis regarding this item remains unchanged.  As noted in the original synopsis, Criteria (f) through (h) are secondary and will only be used as tie-breakers among technically equal firms.

(b) Although proposal and offer may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying information on the AN/AAR-47 Missile Warning System Set (MWS ) Ground Test Set that have already been developed and may be modified to meet the agency requirement as listed below: Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center (AATC) is conducting a Request for Information/ Sources Sought in an effort to d etermine potential sources for a new and/or improved AN/AAR-47 Missile Warning Set Ground Test Set.  This announcement is for market research and does not constitute an RFP.  AATC is seeking contractors who are interested in providing a ground test set tha t will conduct end-to-end testing of the AAR-47 MWS as installed in various military aircraft.  The Government is looking for a system that offers best value to the Government, not necessarily the lowest procurement cost; however, affordability is the most  important factor.  The following information is provided to assist in conducting a RFI/Sources Sought by identifying potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort.   Test set requirements: (1) The O-Level test set, hereinafter referred to as the test set, shall emit a detectable test signal recognizable by the AN/AAR-47(V)1/(V)2/A(V)2 Missile Warning System to verify sensor functionality and determine sensor sensitivit y at the organizational and operational levels.    (2) The test set shall consist of a ruggeddized shipping / storage container, a battery operated, self-contained, hand-held programmable signal generator/emitter, a removable filter (if applicable), a batt ery charger, and provisions for a spare lamp and battery.  The test set shall be used in ground and shipboard environments.  Operation of the test set under all environmental conditions shall not result in damage or degradation of the AN/AAR-47(V)1/(V)2/A( V)2 performance.   Must provide a display that is clearly visible in low-light and sunlight conditions.  (3) Operating Life: the test set shall be designed to have a useful operating life of fifteen (15) years when maintained in accordance with applicable maintenance procedures.   (4)  The test set shall weigh no more than 25 lbs.  The programmable signal generator/emitter (with battery installed) shall weigh no more than fifteen (15) lbs and shall not exceed twenty (20) inches in length nor have a diameter  greater than six (6) inches.   (5) The test set shall have a predicted useful life of at least 5000 hours mean time between failures (MTBF) when operated under conditions specified herein.  A failure is defined as any fault that requires unscheduled maint enance as a corrective action.  The MTBF shall be calculated in accordance with MIL-HDBK-217.  Replacement of lamps, fuses, batteries, and desiccants shall not be considered failures for reliability.   (6) Electronic Discharge: the contractor shall comply with the requirements of MIL STD 1686.   (7)  Interface with the AN/AAR-47(V)1/(V)2/A(V)2 MWS: the range of operation for end-to-end functional systems testing shall be no less than fifteen (15) meters from the sensor.  The test set applications environmen t will be fixed and rotary wing, high velocity, low/slow, transport and civil aircraft.    (8) Organizational Level Test Signal: the test set shall emit a detectable test signal r ecognizable by the MWS.  The range of operation for the test signal shall be from 0.15 meters up to a minimum of fifteen (15) meters from any sensor.   (9) Sensitivity Signal: the test set shall emit a detectable sensitivity signal at an irradiance level w hich, at a zero (0) meter distance, or ability to block ambient UV sources, and will generate a constant 70,000 counts per second within a tolerance of +/- 10%, for a sensor with a normalized photon irradiance response (PIR) of 1.0.    (10) Operational End -to-End Signal: the test set shall emit a detectable signal in the operational (normal) mode which will in turn trigger both an indication on the AN/AAR-47s control indicator and dispense command to the countermeasures dispensing systems (CMDS) such as th e ALE-39/40/47 system.  (11)  The test set must remain in calibration, and not require factory calibration after delivery.     Interested parties capable of providing a test set, which meets or exceeds the above requirements, shall provide a Statement of Capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to provide, modify, and sustain the system and a description of syste m capabilities.  The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify system capability as related to the technical effort requested above.  A limit of fifty (50) pages is imposed for the responses. Responses sho uld be received by close of business 22 May 2006.

<DESC>The Department Of Commerce intends to award a sole source purchase order, base period and one option year to Michael Kandrashoff to act as project field manager in a study of the prevalence of fish with abnormalities in the St. Lucie estuarine system and nearby reference sites.  Mr Kandrashoff is familiar with the St. Lucie estuarine system project.  Mr. Kandrashoff has  helped NOAA develop a detailed list of the types of externally visible abnormalities that occur in fish in South Florida.  He also helped NOAA develop a categorization scheme for these abnormalities that has been applied within the NMFS.   He is thoroughly acquainted with the codes and categorization schemes used to record fish species and the various types of abnormalities used by NOAA in this project. He is familiar with the fish species of this area, their scientific names, their habits and habitats as related to their capture, and the various abnormalities that occur in the fish of this area.  He is well versed in the literature on abnormalities in fish and fish as indicators of environmental quality.   He has been trained to collect and preserve skin, fin, and liver tissues for histopathological analyses.  Analysis of the database to date has shown distinct relationships between abnormalities and potential sources of variation, including especially species but also year, season, and area. The strong statistical relationships evident in the data attest to the quality of field screening and recording of data. This service is to continue the biological sampling component of a multi-year NOAA project being conducted with funding through the State of Florida in the St. Lucie Issue Team Initiative.  Because of the nature of this requirement, it is important to the success of this multi-year project that collection of data be continued without interruption. Missing data points affect the quality of the analysis. Further, it is also important that there remains some consistency among the observers screening the fish to ensure that discrimination is consistent.  The data could be seriously compromised if consistency in technique is compromised.  Project objectives are to (1) quantify the most obvious sources of variation in the prevalence of abnormal fish (taxonomic, temporal, spatial, and type of abnormality), (2) standardize an index of prevalence for sources of variation that might confound the ability to discern trends, (3) determine trends over time, (4) compare the St. Lucie estuarine system to nearby reference areas, (5) characterize the abnormalities miscroscopically, (6) examine the relationship of prevalence to potential causal factors, and (7) develop performance measures for use in evaluating biological effects of regional and local restoration projects.  The major objective of the field component of the St. Lucie project is to sample the fish of the St. Lucie estuarine system and a reference site to extend a multi-year database and facilitate statistical analyses. A second objective is to acquire tissue samples to allow microscopic analysis of the abnormalities.  The Government requires the services of a project field manager and principal sampler to  perform the following:  1) sample fish with rod and reel (and other gear, as required) one full day (8 hrs per day in each of three general areas:  the outer St. Lucie estuary, the inner St. Lucie estuary (upstream from Hell’s Gate), and Jupiter Inlet), for a total of 3 sampling days per week. The contractor shall screen the fish for externally visible abnormalities and record the following information for each fish caught: date, station, salinity, temperature, wind observations, observed dredging activity, species, length, number of abnormalities of each type :2)  The contractor shall assign to each abnormal fish a unique identifier in the form of a code that indicates capture date, capture location (station), species, and number.  Fish should be numbered as they are caught. The contractor shall enter the data from each sampling trip into a database (Quattro Pro), with a separate data file for each month and main region (i.e., outer St. Lucie, inner St. Lucie, Jupiter Inlet), and provide the three data files to NOAA/NMFS each month.3)  The contractor shall manage and coordinate a volunteer reporting program with charter-boat guides and recreational fishers.  The contractor shall show the volunteers how to screen fish for externally visible abnormalities, how to recognize the 17 major categories of abnormalities seen in the St. Lucie system, how to record the data in the field, and how to enter the data in a database.  Where necessary, the contractor shall provide the data entry.  These data shall be maintained separately from the data acquired directly by the contractor to avoid loss of reliability in the contractor’s data. Data obtained from each volunteer shall be identified with the name of the volunteer in each record.  The contractor shall maintain regular contact with the volunteers to ensure consistency and timely acquisition of data; 4)The contractor shall provide the motorized boat, fuel, bait, gear, and ice required for sampling; 5) The contractor shall provide a freezer and maintain special samples in the freezer as required by the COTR.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 10 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications, and any additional supporting literature that demonstrates their knowledge of and experience in performing the type of service described herein. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the technical ability and demonstrated past experience to meet the requirements described in the description section above. Interested firms should submit the required information to Sharon Walker. Fax to 816-274-6983

<DESC>United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) is contemplating a modification to contract F08626-98-C0029, USAFE Rangeless Interim System (URITS).  The purpose of the modification is to extend the period of performance of the current contract by 5 years to end 30 September 2012.  This contract action is contemplated to be sole source based on the fact that URITS was specifically developed for USAFE and contains proprietary hardware and software.  This contract provides for operations and maintenance and contractor logistical support services on 110 leased aircraft mounted pods that supports the USAFE pilot training program.  URITS is a derivative of the Range Applications Program system called the Metrics Autonomous ACTS and was developed and built by Metric Systems Corporation now named DRS Training & Control Systems, Inc., 645 Anchor Street, Fort Walton Beach, Florida 32548.  Pods are owned assets of DRS and leased by USAFE.  All Pods used require full compatibility with the existing URITS, including hardware and software interfaces such as the Data Transfer Devices (DTDs) and Datalink capability.  Additionally, pods shall have system Certification and Accreditation mandated by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force.  The primary purpose of this action is to provide small business access to acquisition information and enhance competition by identifying contracting and subcontracting activities.

<OFFADD>Bureau of Reclamation - PNRO 1150 N Curtis Rd, Ste 100 Boise ID 83706
<SUBJECT>P--Informational Site Visit FDR Lake Debris Collection and Removal
<DESC>Later in the Fall of this year, the Bureau of Reclamation will issue a solicitation for a five-year contract for the operation and maintenance of a series of log booms for the collection and disposal of floating debris on Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) Lake.  FDR Lake was formed by the impoundment of the Columbia River behind the Grand Coulee Dam.  The work sites are at the upper end of FDR Lake near the town of Kettle Falls, Washington, which is approximately 80 miles North/Northwest of Spokane, Washington.  An informational site visit for the work described below will be held on Tuesday, May 16, 2006.  The NAICS Code for this action is 488390. Reclamation has two debris collection sites and one debris removal site on the Columbia River near Kettle Falls, WA.  The two collection sites are located at China Bar (approximately River Mile 724) and at the mouth of the Kettle River (approximately River Mile 707).  The disposal site is at Boise Cove, downstream from the mouth of the Kettle River (approximately River Mile 702).  The collection sites use log booms to capture floating debris.  The floating debris consists of logs, snags, and slash from up-river logging, uprooted trees and brush from riverbank undercutting, miscellaneous debris, and garbage.  Historically, the debris has been constrained with log booms and towed to Boise Cove for removal.  Depending on the lake level, a concrete boat ramp at Boise Cove allows a contractor easy access for removing debris.  Once out of the water the debris becomes the property of the contractor.  Reclamation does not have land locations for the permanent storage of debris. The China Bar debris collection site consists of a 2,070-foot main earthen dike, a 1,600-foot auxiliary earthen dike, and a number of log booms.  The North, Middle, and South log booms form a string of boom logs that remove debris from the current of the river in a shearing action and together are referred to as the shear boom.  The 2,500-foot North Main Boom consists of a double string of boom logs; each boom log is approximately 33 feet long.  The 950-foot Middle Main Boom consists of a double string of boom logs.  The 2,500-foot South Main Boom consists of a single string of boom logs.  There is a holding area log boom for storage of debris diverted by the main shear boom and a safety log boom to ensure that debris doesn't escape the collection facility.  Government-furnished facilities include storage buildings, a small work shop, basic sanitary facilities, and a small building for day-time use. The Kettle River debris collection boom is located in FDR Lake at the mouth of the Kettle River.  It consists of single-string log booms totaling about 4,500 feet in length and spanning the mouth of the Kettle River.  There is a permanent opening in the log boom for public navigation when the lake elevation is above 1255 feet.  An additional single string of boom logs, approximately 2,800 feet long, forms a liner along the main section of the collection area of the log boom for additional strength to hold collected debris.  It is used to encircle the debris to hold it in place after the collection period and to tow the debris to Boise Cove. The Boise Cove site is located on Lake Roosevelt and is adjacent to Boise Cascade Corporation's log storage yard.  It consists of a log boom of about 45 boom logs in a single string, enclosing a majority of the river cove.  This log boom is used to store bagged debris on the inside.  Government and Contractor flotilla is usually moored around the perimeter.  A concrete access ramp is used for debris removal.  The access ramp must have a lake elevation of approximately 1275 feet or above for equipment to reach the debris. The contractor will have to work with changing river level, current, and velocity in order to maintain and manipulate the log booms, anchors, and buoys for efficient debris collection, debris breach protection, and moorage of flotilla.  Hazardous operating conditions may be encountered on the upper Columbia River.  The contractor also must maintain a few navigational lights.  Preparation for the debris collection season and for the Spring runoff begins April 1st.  Collection, monitoring, and maintenance is ongoing from April 1st, culminating with the removal of debris by November 30th. Please contact me to register to attend the site visit, that way we know if you're coming or not.  We will convene for the site visit in Kettle Falls at 9:00am Tuesday morning at the Chevron Gas and Go Minimart/Truck Stop at the intersection of Highways 25 and 395.  We anticipate that the site visit will take about 3 hours.  This first site visit will give potential contractors the opportunity to view the work sites during Spring conditions.  Another site visit will be held in the October/November timeframe after the solicitation is issued.  Attendance at site visits is not mandatory but highly encouraged.  My phone number is 208-378-5105, our fax number is 208-378-5108, and my email address is jhedeen@pn.usbr.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Augmented Reality Technology Roadmap Request For Information
<DESC>The Simulation & Training Technology Center (STTC), supporting the Research, Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM), has formed a Technology Working Group for the purpose of developing a Augmented Reality Technology Roadmap.  The Roadmap's overall objective is to support the Army’s endeavor to develop and mature augmented reality capabilities for military training and the creation of “Augmented Live Environment Concepts,” covering man-worn, vehicle-mounted and fixed site (e.g. training and test ranges, individual and crew-served gunnery, etc.) applications.  To this end, a Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to survey Other Government Agencies, Private Industry and Academia, to collect information and data that would be useful for the accelerated development of a comprehensive “Augmented Reality Technology Roadmap.”  This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Solicitation for an offer but a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. 

The Roadmap will address the research, development, production, technology insertion, fielding, and effective use of augmented reality (or mixed reality) systems for military training.  Upon completion, the Roadmap will be a living document that will support:

1.The Army’s understanding of R&D trends within other government agencies, private industry and academia, in the field of augmented reality or related technologies.

2.TRADOC requirements writers in the assessment of current and future army training requirements and identification of technology shortfalls.  

3.RDECOM Science & Technology (S&T) managers in developing appropriate augmented reality solutions that address identified technology shortfalls. 

4.The Army’s planning, funding and future implementation of Army Technology Objectives (ATOs), Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) efforts, Technology Demonstrations (TDs), etc. in this area of technology.

5.Maintaining a dialogue mechanism to help focus the R&D efforts of other government agencies, industry and academia participants toward Army Force Operating Capabilities and Technology Shortfalls.

This survey covers the seven year planning, programming, budgeting, and execution period beginning in FY ’07 through FY ’13. 

Augmented Reality - Army Research Vision:Augmented reality (AR) is a concept and method of presenting data/information, graphics and 2D/3D virtual objects (generated by virtual and constructive simulations) to a subject or trainee, while operating in a live field environment.  Rather than viewing and operating fully immersed in a synthetic virtual environment, a subject or trainee operates in the live field environment while receiving real-time data or information into his field of view that is relevant to the mission.  Additionally, the operator would interact with virtual targets, personnel or vehicles (that are controlled by virtual and constructive simulations) as though they were real.  In the future, these same concepts and technologies would potentially allow for situational awareness, communications, map data, etc. to be provided to Warfighters in complex operational environments without impeding their live view.   

At present, the U.S. Army does not have a definitive requirement for the use of augmented reality.  (The Roadmap will be used to address this issue.)  However, recent Army funded research suggests that augmented reality may be used in a broad variety of army training applications; especially as an enabling technology that supports the live player in the Live Virtual Constructive Integration Architecture (LVC-IA).  Currently, there is no two-way flow and presentation of training data between the live training domain and the virtual-constructive training domains.  The existing LVC-IA focuses mainly on transmitting live participants’ position data into the virtual domain for viewing and interaction; however, live participants cannot "see" the real-time rendering of personnel, vehicles, fire and effects, etc. that originate from the virtual domain.  In order to effectively “Train the Force, How and As It Fights!,” there must be a complete replication of the complex operating environment, through the full integration of live, virtual, and constructive simulations.  The concept of Live Augmented Environments have the potential to create interactive, multi-sensory, non-linear environments that provides the Warfighter with unparalleled and realistic live training and experiential learning.  Such a capability would potentially provide commanders and trainers with creative and flexible solutions sets for the ever-changing and fluctuating missions and training requirements of the modern Warfighter.

Augmented Reality Pacing Technology Categories & Human Performance Concerns:Augmented reality is a highly inter-disciplinary concept and approach to merging the real and virtual worlds; which can be implemented using a wide variety of configurations and approaches.  However, there are several broad categories of technology that must be effectively integrated together to implement an effective, real-time augmented reality system.  Based on past research efforts and for the purpose of this survey, these AR pacing technologies are divided into the following categories:

1.Position, Orientation & Movement Tracking within Live Environments. Robust man-worn and vehicle mounted tracking systems based on multiple/hybrid sensor packages with sophisticated filtering algorithms that would more accurately sense, track and relate real and virtual objects that are operating in the live environment; whether indoors or outdoors.  Systems supporting dismounted and mounted applications should be mobile and operate free (tether-less) from any fixed infrastructure.  Fixed site and range applications may make use of appropriate tracking infrastructure; including markers and marker-less tracking techniques.

2.High-Speed Stereo and Machine Vision Video Analysis Techniques. 
Facilitate the capture and analysis of live video streams to be used as supplemental tracking data.  This data would aid in distance measurement, depth perception and further tracking of prominent man-made and natural objects in the real environment.

3.Head/Vehicle Mounted, Hand-Held, etc.  Displays. 
Low-cost head mounted/vehicle mounted and hand-held displays.  Focus on rugged, flexible materials and techniques that can mold, infuse or embed a wide field-of-view heads up display capability, into existing and planned helmet and vehicle designs.

4.High-Speed Computing and Real-Time Graphics and Image Rendering. Dual and multi-processing techniques that render virtual objects in a believable (continuous, accurate placement and manipulation of occlusion models) manner that is compelling and realistic to the observer operating in an augmented live environment.

5.Real-Time, Distributed Collaboration. Networking and communications capability, necessary to interface augmented reality systems with and across other distributed training domains.

6.Human Performance and Training Effectiveness. Programs of experimentation on human perception in AR including the following topics: research on design of the human system interface; prevalence of simulator sickness or other side effects, especially as a function of system characteristics or conditions of use; strategies for using AR in training, and their effectiveness in both skill acquisition and transfer; fidelity requirements for effective training and transfer.

Program Objective:
The resulting technology roadmap will support RDECOM’s overall program objective for this technology area, which is to develop and mature augmented reality capabilities for military training and the creation of “Augmented Live Environments Concepts,” covering man-worn, vehicle-mounted and fixed site (e.g. training and test ranges, individual and crew-served gunnery, etc.) applications.  Success would require obtaining technology readiness levels (TRL) 6, for discrete applications, while endeavoring to transition system and subsystem components to other military technology and acquisition programs.  

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITAION and a contract will not be awarded; however, other government agencies, academia and private industry are encouraged to participate in this survey and to provide any type and amount of information as deemed appropriate.  The following are suggested guidelines for the type of information that would be most useful in the development of the U.S. Army’s Augmented Reality Technology Roadmap* (Augmented reality is the real-time rendering and presentation of virtual objects to personnel operating in a live complex environment):

1.Provide information that describes your company or organization’s background, capabilities, and areas of expertise.

2.Cover currently available and/or emerging technologies; as well as planned and futuristic concepts that would be necessary to employ real-time augmented reality in a live field training environment.

3.Describe your company or organization’s recent research, developments, existing prototypes and systems fielded to the military or sold in the commercial market.  What specific military training application would be best supported by your R&D, prototypes and systems?  Provide brochures, spec sheets, pictures and video clips of the system in use. 

4.Describe your view of the current state-of-the-art for each of the AR pacing technology categories; and where these technologies are heading over the next 7 years (FY ’07 - FY ’13).  Identify the level of research by its level of maturity (technology readiness level) and/or research category, e.g. Basic Research (6.1), Applied Research (6.2) or Advanced Research (6.3). 

5.Identify potential military training applications for AR.  Provide a timeline for when each AR application may be ready for demonstration in a relevant military training environment (TRL 6).

6.Describe any newly emerging technologies or the latest advancements that may accelerate the development of AR capabilities and training systems for military use.

7.Describe the major obstacles to embedding or inserting AR capabilities into existing and planned military training and weapons systems.  Discuss how these obstacles may be overcome.  

8.Reference and/or provide recently published papers that address aspects of AR research that would be important for the Army to review.

Please provide all or as much information as possible on compact disks, DVDs, memory sticks and/or other appropriate digital media no later than 25 May 2006 to the Science and Technology Manager, Frank Dean, RDECOM-STTC, 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL  32826.

*It is anticipated that the results of the RFI will identify other government agencies, private industry and academia that have an interest in providing information on their recent developments and future plans for use of augmented reality systems and techniques.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION for a contract; however, those entities interested in providing information should submit their response no later than 25 May 2006 to the attention of Mr. Frank Dean, Science and Technology Manager, Phone (407) 384-3877, Fax (407) 384)-5454, email address Frank.Dean@us.army.mil

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation includes applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-09.  This synopsis, identified as No. 1014980, is to notify contractors of the government’s intent to negotiate a sole-source award to Lawrence Carroll, located in Washington, DC, for professional services to review improvement and development of management systems for CFSAN.  There is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the following reasons:  These unique services are only available from the existing contractor who has been actively involved as a consultant and has worked closely with the Deputy Center Director and the Senior Management Team in facilitating personnel issues since January 1998. CFSAN is faced this fiscal year with reduction of employees through buy options.  Some programs are being eliminated and employees may be transferred to other positions in the Center.  Dr. Carroll has thorough knowledge and understanding of FDA/CFSAN organizational procedures and effective abilities as a facilitator.  Therefore, Dr. Carroll has unique skills which enable him to provide an objective review and evaluation of the existing personnel problems.  In addition, some of the changes will be confidential in nature and Dr. Carroll has built trust with Senior Management to handle delicate issues at CFSAN.  Continuing the services of Dr. Carroll with allow CFSAN Management to maintain continuity of effort for personnel directed services.  Dr. Carroll’s long standing knowledge of and association with Center issues will (1) enhance the organization’s effectiveness, (2) achieve CFSAN’s established program priorities, (3) raise employee productivity, (4) empower employees at all levels, and (5) improve employee morale.  Dr. Carroll’s availability to the Center at this time is crucial in assisting FDA with unusually critical personnel issues.  Continuing Dr. Carroll’s consultation services will result in overall savings in resources, pertaining to both fiscal and manpower.  Scope of Work:  The contractor shall work closely with CFSAN Leadership Team and Managers.  The contractor shall provide expert advice, consultation, assistance, guidance and counseling to support &/or improve management and organization efforts.  This may involve individual &/or joint consultation sessions with managers.  The contractor shall collect, review and analyze pertinent data on CFSAN management system and propose new changes to Managers.  The contractor shall conduct organizational assessments of current activities and ongoing programs and provide strategic action plan with milestones for proposed changes.  The contractor shall work with individual Office Directors in planning and establishing internal priority efforts to enhance management/employee relations for cross referencing projects.  There will be deliverables with scheduled due dates.  Period of performance is one year from date of award.  
The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.  The following agenda have been attached to this provision:  None.  
Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items.
The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.  The following agenda have been attached to the clause:  None.
The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.  
The following FAR clauses cited are applicable:  FAR 52.222-26, FAR 52.222-35, FAR 52.222-36, FAR 52.225-3, FAR 52.225-15, FAR 52.232-33.  Clauses and provisions are incorporated by reference and apply to this acquisition.  
The associated NAICS code is 541611 –Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Service and the small business size standard is $6.5M.  The reasons stated above, considered in their entirety, are why FDA anticipates a sole source award to Lawrence Carroll, however, other sources may submit descriptive literature that fully demonstrates their capabilities and they will be reviewed to determine if they are considered qualified.  All responsible sources that intend to submit descriptive literature shall submit it by COB on the due date referenced above to the following address or e-mail:  Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 2083, HFA-500, Rockville, Maryland  20857-0001 or Lorena.Forgosh@fda.hhs.gov.  The Government will award a fixed-price, commercial services purchase order using commercial acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR 12.6.  No purchase order award will be made on the basis of any responses to this notice.  For information regarding this synopsis/solicitation, please contact Lori Forgosh at 301-827-7044, fax 301-827-7106 or e-mail Lorena.Forgosh@fda.hhs.gov.

<RESPDATE>052005
<CONTACT>Kathy P. Swanson,931-454-4409
<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT No. (BAA) 05-02-AEDC/PKP:  The Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center (DTRMC), through Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), is soliciting research proposals in the area of hypersonics testing and evaluation/science and technology (T+E/S+T) development.  DTRMC seeks innovative proposals in the hypersonics area that will allow improved test and evaluation of current systems and future systems over the next 10 to 15 years.  The goal is not to perform basic research, but to develop subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. The results of this type of effort are proof of technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use.  DTRMC seeks advances in hypersonic and related technologies in the areas of (not in priority):  1) COMBUSTION AND NON-INTRUSIVE FLOW DIAGNOSTICS for ground test applications (applications to flight test is a plus), specifically, non-intrusive measurement capability for determination of species concentration, temperature, and/or velocities in flows associated with hypersonic test facilities and scramjet engines are required.  Robust systems capable of working reliably in a test environment, that are minimally intrusive to the test article and facil!  ity hardware, and have the capability of retrieving spatially resolved flow parameters are especially needed.  2) CONCEPTS FOR AUTONOMOUS FLIGHT TERMINATION SYSTEMS FOR HYPERSONIC FLIGHT TEST VEHICLES are required.  3) Technologies that aid in the STRUCTURAL TESTING or provide new capabilities in testing of materials and whole vehicle static structural testing at elevated temperatures and pressure conditions that simulate hypersonic flight conditions are required.  4) NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE VARIABLE MACH NUMBER HYPERSONIC GROUND TESTING facilities that will provide hypersonic flight trajectory simulation capabilities are required.  Specifically, enabling technologies for large scale ground testing of integrated turbine based combined cycle/ramjet/scramjet inlet and mode transition testing are required.   It is expected that a modified AEDC Aeropropulsion Engine Test Facility (ASTF) (with extension of Mach number to 4 or 5) will be the only viable candidate for such a large scale integrated propulsion test capability and therefore will be the only viable candidate for receiving the proposed technology.  5) CLEAN AIR HEATER TECHNOLOGIES for hypersonic test facilities capable of providing reliable non-vitiated air for hypersonic testing applications is required; 6) MODELING AND SIMULATION (M+S) efforts that have application to test and evaluation are required. Areas of interest include: integrated propulsion system and airframe performance models, high speed (+M5) store separation, aerothermal heat transfer with application to aerodynamic shaping and thermal management including aerothermal chemistry and boundary-layer transition effects, transient modeling incorporating the effects of inlet un-start and combustor dynamics, electron beam energy addition to high pressure flows, !  ultra high pressure aerothermal equation of state of air (approx. 300,000 psi).  M+S efforts with demonstrated verification of predictive/modeling capabilities using existing or acquisition of new data are preferred, and must possess strong test and evaluation applications.  M+S proposals must possess a strongly stated T+E application justification. M+S proposals with primarily system development application will receive little or no preference.  PROJECT SCOPE:  Awards totaling approximately $2.5-$3.0M are expected to be made in FY06.  Increased funding levels are anticipated to occur in the following fiscal years.  The prospective proposers should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding or level of effort.  GENERAL INFORMATION:   Proposals should address development and/or operational test and evaluation technologies. DTRMC strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities.  Teaming among academia, industry, and/or government partners is encouraged; however, this is not a requirement.   Projects with strong transition plans to DoD T+E ground or flight test facilities or with DoD T+E facility participation will receive preference.  Because awards may be made in which contractors expect to access or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public, the contracts will contain DFARS Clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.  This requirement will be in subcontracts as well. Projects will be awarded in phases with the later phases being funded in FY07 or later and will be contingent on fund availability, merit of performance in previous phases, and anticipated future T+E requirements for the technologies being addressed.  In order to minimize the magnitude of the proposal preparation and review process, a proposal abstract of no more than 15 pages total should be submitted by 20 May 05.  Each proposal should specify the benefiting U.S.  military service and the executing organization with subcontractors (where applicable), and their specific roles.  The proposal should briefly describe the out-year effort beyond completion of the phase I effort.  Each proposal should address a specific T+E hypersonic need.   Each proposer and subcontractor will be required to submit written verification stating they are aware of their responsibility to have DoD approval for public release of information pertaining to the proposed project (including technical reports, papers, and presentations) as required by DoD regulations regarding the dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  EVALUATION: Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria:  (1) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) relevance to current T+E hypersonic technology test requirements not addressed in other DoD programs(3) offeror's capabilities and related experience, (4) cost realism of proposed effort, and (5) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition to T+E application and/or to DoD  T+E facilities.  Upon review, the Hypersonics Test Working Group,  T+through AEDC, will respond to proposal abstracts with a recommendation to submit or not to submit a full proposal and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposals and proposal abstracts should be submitted on CD-ROM in .pdf format and forwarded to:  AEDC/PKP, Attn:  Kathy P. Swanson, 100 Kindel Drive, Suite A332, Arnold AFB, TN 37389-1332.

Team Mate Software Updates and Maintenance
Document Number AIRAR6RA007

Background:  The mission of DFAS Internal Review (IR) is to provide responsive, professional objective information and advice to enhance DFAS stewardship over DoD resources.  One important function is internal audit.  Audits are documented using standard working paper processes.   IR follows the working paper guidance published in the DoD Office of the Inspector General Audit Manual Chapter 9.  Currently, all IR auditors utilize TeamMate, a commercial off the shelf software developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The use of this software automates and standardizes the working paper process.  All members of IR have the capability of accessing the software remotely as it resides on a terminal server housed at DFAS Indianapolis.  

Purpose: The purpose of this procurement is to purchase the necessary maintenance/software updates which support utilization of the software.  

Scope of Work:  The software is accessible to approximately 80 users (IR auditors) with current capability of supporting up to 150 users.

Requirements:  The contractor will provide telephone and electronic help desk support and software upgrades/updates.

<DESC>Request for Proposal
Wireless Internet System 
Office of Personnel Management
Federal Executive Institute

Purpose and Scope of Project

This is a new competitive procurement that will result in the award of a single firm, fixed-price contract for installing wireless internet service on the campus of the Federal Executive Institute. The Federal Executive Institute, (FEI), is a federal government facility that provides residential training to federal executives. FEI has elements of government, hospitality industry, and educational institutions in its operations. The installation requires establishing wireless service to cover the entire campus which includes three buildings with eighty two guest bedrooms, 12 classrooms, dining and fitness facilities, and offices for a staff of forty government and contract workers.

REQUIREMENTS

Coverage
Wireless service must provide 100% coverage within all three buildings with the exception of the kitchen food prep and basement storage area of the main building and the maintenance area of Pendleton Hall. Coverage must include all bedrooms, classrooms, lounge areas, office areas an outdoor classroom area located between buildings and an outdoor patio area adjacent to the main building. 
FEI currently subscribes to a high speed DSL service connection in each building through Sprint/EarthLink. It is our intention to have wireless access points extended from these services using a central control and monitoring point in each building to provide coverage and access by technical personnel.
FEI will offer only internet service to it’s customers via wireless and will not be connecting this service to its wired network in any way. 

Security
FEI facilities are located on a fourteen acre campus and wishes to take advantage of its   physical isolation and of signal encryption to protect the security of it’s users as much as is practicable. Wireless access point antennae position and power levels must be adjusted to avoid any signal radiating beyond the perimeter of the property if possible. Access points must support the latest encryption standards to include, but not limited to, WEP, WPA2, and WPA.  Configuration of the access points must be approved by FEI.   Access points must be accessible from a centrally located controller within in each building and be accessible individually via wireless connection using manufacturer supplied utility/configuration software for reprogramming encryption keys and running diagnostic programs. 

System Maintenance
The offeror must include comprehensive maintenance support for one year and a maintenance plan option for out years two, three, and four. The minimum requirement for maintenance support must include two hour business day response by phone, 24 hour response 24X7 by phone, and forty eight hour business day onsite response to perform necessary service to the system. Offerors must demonstrate that they are doing business in, and have qualified service technicians under their direct employ whose duty station is within 50 miles of the FEI campus. No exceptions will be considered for this requirement.  The offeror will also provide 4 health checks and site assessments per calendar year, one each quarter.  This will include, but is not limited to, configuration checks, equipment checks and systems security assessments.


Installation
Offeror must provide all access points, wiring, routers, hubs, power supplies, antennae, smart jacks, and any other hardware or software necessary for a complete turnkey installation. All wiring must be hidden in walls or ceilings. Exceptions for short runs in inconspicuous areas may be approved to reduce cost and complexity of installation. All exposed wiring must be pre approved by the FEI technical representative to meet the requirements of this procurement.
 The successful offeror must be responsible for communication with and coordination of service requirements involving the service provider.  FEI runs classes on a continuous basis and is at full occupancy over ninety percent of the time. Classes often include evenings and weekends.  Offeror must be flexible in scheduling installation which may include some nights and weekends. Classes can not be moved, changed, or rescheduled to accommodate installation.  A schedule of classes and facility availability will be made available to the selected offeror. An FEI representative will be available when installation personnel are on campus.
Offeror must provide relocation of existing LAN wiring in bedrooms and some common areas from the OPM network to the new system to provide both wireless and wired connection to DSL service. Hidden wiring not terminated is not required to be reconnected.  The number of connections to be relocated will not exceed 80 connections in the main building and 20 connections in each of the other two buildings. A separate equipment housing is required in the main building.  Existing connections will be removed from the OPM network. Separate patch panels and other hardware are required as necessary to physically isolate the OPM network from the wireless network.

Hardware and software
Access points must be configured for automatic 802.11 a, b, g trimode support and be capable of a minimum 40mbs pass-through for all clients. Access point hardware must have rogue access point detection fully software upgradeable to AES and 802.11i, have client isolation  capability to prevent client-to-client snooping. Hardware must be designed for configuration with external ceiling mount antennae.  Proxim AP4000 access points are preferred but access points with equivalent or higher capabilities can be used. Consumer units designed for home and small office use are not acceptable.

The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), 52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   Contract evaluation and process will conducted under FAR Part 13.5 – Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Past Performance and Price, with past performance being somewhat more important than price. (1)  Past Performance Evaluation Standards: The offeror shall demonstrate Past Performance through completion of similar U.S. Navy contracts for same or similar installations.  The Contracting Officer may consider past performance experience with contracts that cover numerous other types of marine decking installation contracts.  Data submitted by the offeror other than relevant contracts may not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Failure to submit past performance information shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate.  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm’s most recently completed U.S. Navy (not to exceed five years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance.
Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer’s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  2.  Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Jan 2004), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed.
The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.
Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award.
3.  Best Value Determination.  The Government reserves the right to select an offeror with other than the best past performance, if the price is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute best value.  On the other hand, the Government may select an offeror with other than the lowest price if the quality of past performance and a fair and reasonable price of a competitor result in the greatest value to the Government.  Any such determination of best value will be made by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the evaluation criteria identified in this plan and the solicitation.
 (b) Options. N/A.
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
