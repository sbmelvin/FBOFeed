<DESC>This notice is in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2, Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), Acquisition Operations Branch is the contracting office for this procurement.

The purpose of this notice is to announce the intent to award a firm fixed-price Purchase Order on a sole source basis to the Health & Safety Executive (HSE), Rose Court 2 Southwark Bridge London, SE1 9HS, United Kingdom (DUNS: 228753372), in accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b) soliciting from a single source.

The Health & Safety Executive (HSE) is leading a shared research program aimed at improving the collective knowledge and understanding of the long-term integrity of engineered composite repairs. For BSEE to find another organization with the expertise and capability of HSE would come at a considerable larger cost to the Government and would result in duplication of work. With a reduced cost to the Government due to the cost sharing for this JIP, the Government will obtain high quality deliverables in a subject matter in which there is a serious knowledge gap throughout the entire industry and will greatly benefit from the results of the research. Only HSE can act as the contractor as they are currently running the JIP that is being conducted at this time.

It is anticipated that a purchase order award will occur on or before October 2018. The anticipated period of performance for this Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) project as 5 months with the anticipation of a 2 month extension for continued research.

The applicable NAICS Code is 541715 (Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Live Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology). This is NOT a request for competitive quotes. This notice of intent is for informational purposes only. However, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency if received by the Point of Contact (POC) listed below by 12:00 p.m. ET, September 14, 2018 (reference Solicitation No. 140E0118Q0092). A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is within the discretion of the Government. POC: David Jablonski, Contracting Officer, BSEE, Acquisition Operations Branch - VAE-AMD, 45600 Woodland Rd., Sterling, VA 20166. Any response to this notice shall be emailed to the Contracting Officer, David Jablonski at David.Jablonski@bsee.gov.

<DESC>Performance Work Statement


Contract Title: Perfect Match   Aptitude Test

Job Profile Development for Increased Veteran Hiring for Specific Career Fields.

Background:

The VA would to put a contract in place that would create job profiles that will allow veterans to be competitive in fields with little/no experience, but the personal skills to be successful. 

Scope:

The project is intended to produce job profiles for 10 VA job categories (list out profiles), 
One Primary Care Job Profiles
One Engineering Job Profiles
One IT Job Profile
One Fiscal Job Profiles
One Logistics Job Profile
One Patient Business Services Job Profiles
Two Human Resources Job Profiles
Two Long-term Care Job Profiles
in order identify those personal traits that have made high-performing current employees successful. The program is meant to be a pilot program, based at the Chillicothe VA Medical Center (VAMC), to gauge the effectiveness of the program s objectives. 
This project will model 10 positions (by way of an Ideal Candidate Profile) and survey up to 200 veteran incumbents / candidates. The data will be used to identify individuals who closely match the qualities of "top performers" to determine who should be considered for reassignment. The vendor will ask them a series of questions that will develop the evidenced-based job profiles. This aptitude test is then administered by the vendor, on-line. An ideal aptitude profile for that job is developed. Once developed, the Vendor will then algorithmically compare this ideal aptitude profile to the Veterans in the database to find a good match.

Specific Tasks (ST):  

ST #1: Provide a final project plan and timeline to the government for approval, within 30 days of contract award. 

ST #2: Administer an online aptitude test to the current employees in those designated job categories. The government will identify the top 10% of those current employees and provide a list to the contractor. The test should take no more than 15 minutes. 

ST #3: The contractor shall comply all data received from the current position holders and provide aptitude profiles, maintained on a database, that provides information on those qualities that lie outside of experience and education, which contributes to success in those job series.

ST #4: The contractor shall develop an online assessment, based on the above those qualities identified in ST #3, and administer it online to (up to) 200 employees/candidates not in those designated job titles. These incumbents/candidates will be identified by the government and given to the contractor.

ST #5: The contractor shall provide a report to the government within 30 days of ST #4 completion. This report should provide incumbents/candidates that, based on the comparison of the data gathered in ST #3 and ST #4, were evaluated to have those skills needed to be successful in those VA career fields.  

Performance Monitoring: Once the specific services or departments are identified, and the contracting is set in place, we will assemble a team to draft the individuals who we believe would benefit from the Perfect Match project. At that time, we will concentrate on the following areas:  

Number of unique profiles developed
Employee turnover rate
Number of Veterans hired
Employee satisfaction
Security Requirements: Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE)/Government-Furnished Information (GFI):
No equipment used will be Government-Furnished
Names of current Veteran employees will be shared to aid in development of job profiles with consent from employees. The information will not be used outside the VA.

Other Pertinent Information or Special Considerations: Must be able to develop job profiles utilizing top performers then take those profiles and match Veterans who are already employed by the Chillicothe VA Medical Center utilizing an evidenced-based analytics tool.

Risk Control:
Finding Veterans that meet the Job Profiles 
Mitigation - Will work to find not necessarily an absolute perfect connection but a match that makes sense using an evidenced-based method 
Managers buying into this new method 
Mitigation - Will mitigate by showing data and true outcomes
Getting 10 profiles developed   
Mitigation   Will work with vendor to develop timeline with milestones and targets build in. Once project starts we will mutually agree with the Departments that will be involved and the total number of profiles developed, and to determine what a  good fit  means.

Place of Performance: Work will be performed at the Chillicothe VA Medical Center in the Human Services Department to assess staff currently working in the identified positions, the vendor will ask them a series of questions that will develop the evidenced-based job profiles. This aptitude test is then administered by the vendor, on line. An ideal aptitude profile for that job is developed. Once developed, they will then algorithmically compare this ideal aptitude profile to the Veterans in the database to find a good match. They will then connect every  strong fit  Veteran who is interested in this specific job. Chillicothe VAMC will then follow its normal vetting process.
Period of Performance: The required start date is September 30, 2018 and will continue for no more than 1 calendar year, end date September 30, 2019

<CONTACT>Naimah K.  Bhuruku, Contracting Officer, Phone 3012863459, Email naimah.bhuruku@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the continuation of Contract NNG05EC87C with Southwest Research Institute for the LRO/LAMP instrument operations and data analyses. SwRI is currently performing both the instrument operations management, which includes instrument operations planning, scheduling, and engineering parameter review and trending, as well as the science operations, which includes planning all instrument modes, command sequences, calibrations, and data dissemination to the co-investigators and to the general scientific community through the Planetary Data System (PDS).
<p>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to SwRI. The estimated period of performance of this cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract extension will be for one (1) year from March 16, 2019 through March 15, 2020.</p>
<p>SwRI is the only organization currently qualified to perform the subject requirement for the following reasons: 1) Only SwRI possesses the high level scientific expertise, the detailed knowledge of the LAMP instrument and LRO spacecraft, and the capability to carry out the targeting and operations in a manner in which the scientific operations and the flight operations can be merged. 2) Current LAMP team members are unique in their familiarity with the LAMP instrument design, testing and calibration as well as the LRO spacecraft. From 2005-2009, SwRI designed, fabricated, calibrated, tested, and integrated the LAMP instrument with the LRO spacecraft, including testing at the Spacecraft level after delivery to LRO. Under contract NNG05EC87C, SwRI successfully carried out the science operations and science analysis of the LAMP instrument on the LRO spacecraft since launch in June 2009. Dr. Kurt Retherford of SwRI, a leading expert in the field of planetary geophysics, was selected by NASA Headquarters to lead this investigation, based on an evaluation of his proposal submitted under the Announcement of Opportunity for exploration measurements in NASA's LRO Mission (AO NNH04ZSS003O). The LAMP instrument is a state-of-the-art, one-of-a-kind instrument. SwRI developed unique software and processes for: (a) testing the instruments on-orbit, (b) creating the operational table loads, (c) processing the raw data so that scientists can manipulate, display, and analyze the scientific data received, and (d) producing summary data. This effort requires the detailed understanding of the instrument and all related software. Since no other organization was involved with these activities on an in-depth level, no other organization currently has the knowledge and experience to perform the requirement.</p>
<p>Statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source. However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 22 September 2018. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<p>Document Title: Acquisition of AMER sham 680 RGB<br />Document Type: Pre-solicitation Notice<br />Solicitation Number: N02CO84108-33</p>
<p>Posted Date: 09/12/2018<br />Response Date: 09/14/2018 2:00 PM ET<br />Classification Code: 66 - Instruments &amp; laboratory equipment <br />NAICS Code: 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E144, Rockville, MD 20850, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Oncology Branch, Experimental Therapeutics Section plans to procure a sole source basis one (1) Amersham Imager 680RGB from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp, 100 Results Way, Marlborough, MA 01752<br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1 (b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p><br />Only one award will be made as result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p><br />The Amersham 680 is an easy to use sensitive and robust CCD imager designed to provide publication quality digital images of DNA, RNA protein gels and blots.</p>
<p>The purchase of this instrument will replace an earlier aging version of the same machine and increase image capacity in the Experimental Therapeutics Section and allow a greater number of research personnel to use the machine.</p>
<p>SPECIAL ORDER REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; High sensitivity<br />&bull; Sharp images with high resolution<br />&bull; Image a chemiluminescent sample<br />&bull; Densitometry<br />&bull; Highly flexible performance<br />&bull; Robust design<br />&bull; Easy to use<br />&bull; IQ/OQ Validation services</p>
<p>PRODUCT FEATURES/SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS</p>
<p>The required product features/characteristics are ::</p>
<p>&bull; The camera must use a Super CCD with octagonal-shaped photodiodes, in which the pixels are rotated 45 degrees to form an interwoven layout. This feature offers a dense matrix for a more efficient capture of light than conventional interline CCD camera. <br />&bull; It must use a 16-bit camera assures that data is captured across a wide dynamic range across 65,535 gray scales, allowing sensitive detection of weak features without saturating strong features in the image. The entire range of signal can be acquired and quantitation performed from a single image acquisition. <br />&bull; CCD chip must be 15.6 X 23.4 mm. This is a very large chip, ensuring that more light photons are efficiently captured. Each pixel is 10.75mm in size. <br />&bull; The temperature must enable controlled cooling of CCD chip to -25C. Cooling allows significant reduction in background electronic noise, resulting in cleaner acquisition of long exposure chemiluminescent images. The cooling is constantly monitored, which eliminates variability and increases reproducibility. <br />&bull; The wide-aperture must be f/0.85 lens, to allow the most light to be captured by the Super CCD chip. This increases the sensitivity and reduces exposure time required to acquire images of low abundant samples. <br />&bull; In standard mode, all images must be in publication-quality (317dpi). Max resolution = 5.8 Mpix. <br />&bull; Images must be captured with absolutely "no binning" at all, so that the image is not digitally processed.<br />&bull; The process of generating merged JPG color images must be completely automated showing MW markers and chemiluminescent signal.<br />&bull; There must be no proprietary file formats, just standard TIF and JPG.<br />&bull; AI680 must be able to be upgraded at any time to AI680UV, AI680QC or AI680RGB. This expands the capability of the system to meet future needs. The control software is completely integrated to recognize these accessories when present. <br />&bull; - In Semi-Auto capture mode, and automated exposure is made based on an area of interest defined by the user. This enables calculation of optimal exposure time for bands of interest, with optimal dynamic range. <br />&bull; The On-board Windows 7 computer must have the ability to connect in a variety of configurations. You can operate the system via an integrated computer, controlled from a wireless iPad (WiFi), a USB-connected touch-screen, or a traditional monitor with a mouse and keyboard.</p>

<DESC>This is a presolicitation/notice of intent to sole source for services prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Computer and Communications Systems (OCCS) to procure software services on a sole source basis from Slack Technologies, Inc. 155, 5th St, 6th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103 to acquire the software hosted by a vendor with the technical expertise, resources, and experience to allow NLM to implement, train, configure, and maintain the cross-team collaboration and communication tool. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 511210-Software Publishers.
<p>Background: <br />NLM's mission-related work depends on efficient and effective Information Technology services delivery. To achieve that end it is important that the teams engaged in that work communicate and collaborate. The introduction of a proven great collaboration/communication tool is expected to allow for real time sharing of knowledge and working collective on shared endeavors. This will result in increased productivity, time savings, shared responsibility, response time, etc. Recognizing this NLM senior leadership identified strategic IT tools for acquisition. Slack is one of those strategic tools.</p>
<p>Other areas at NIH have procured and implemented Slack Plus for use in communication and coordination of daily IT activities including DevOps, O&amp;M, and Project Management. Additionally, there are areas which currently are using free version of Slack as a communications and coordination tool. NLM will implement Slack to replace the existing freeware usage and as new implementation for the remaining teams. The expectation is that these teams will not only use Slack for communication and coordination within their team but across teams. The implementation of Slack will not mean replacing existing development and operations tools such as JIRA, ServiceNow, etc.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objectives:<br />NLM seeks to acquire the software hosted by a vendor with the technical expertise, resources, and experience to allow NLM to implement, train, configure, and maintain the cross-team collaboration and communication tool. The success of the Slack acquisition will be measured by the following criteria:<br />&bull; Migration of Slack freeware teams to Slack paid subscription <br />&bull; Onboarding of additional NLM teams onto Slack<br />&bull; Increase of collaboration and communication as measured by:<br />o Reduction of escalations to leadership related to communication between and within teams<br />o Adherence to standards and processes laid out by Governance organizations<br />o Number of apps and/or APIs to be developed proposed to Governance board<br />o Slack user metrics showing consistent and sustained usage post deployment<br />o Survey of teams' members perceptions of communications and coordination pre and post Slack<br />&#61607; Survey will be re-issued bi-annually to determine if usage of Slack has become normalized<br />&bull; Adhere to NIH Security and Privacy requirements.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements, Tasks and Deliverables:<br />The Contractor shall furnish all the necessary resources and services necessary to perform the work set forth in the statement of work (SOW) and to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies, protocols and procedures.</p>
<p>Contractor requirements, tasks and deliverables are specified in the attached SOW.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The period of performance shall be a Base Period of twelve (12) months from date of award with two option years.</p>
<p>Place of Performance: This is a vendor hosted software to be accessed over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification:</p>
<p>Slack Technologies, Inc.'s ("Slack") communication and productivity software as a<br />service, and related desktop and mobile applications, made available by Slack via their website<br />is a proprietary service that is exclusively made available by Slack.</p>
<p>After extensive research and evaluation, Slack was chosen as the software platform to increase the NLM's cross-team collaboration and communication throughout the divisions. Currently Slack Technologies only has two authorized resellers, IT1 and Carahsoft, but according to Slack neither of these companies can offer NLM "Fair Billing". We are seeking fair billing for this procurement to ensure that this software tool is utilized how envisioned.</p>
<p>This action is being conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals/Quotes (RFP/RFQ), nor is a RFP/RFQ available; however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NIH. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the required services, property, facilities and funding specified in the SOW and in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and policies. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses shall be in writing and shall be electronically transmitted to merriwetheran@mail.nih.gov by 1:00 PM EST on Friday, September 14, 2018. Any responses shall include pricing information and shall reference Presolictation/Intent to Sole Source Notice No. NIHLM201800106.</p>

The SOW for this requirement includes six primary tasks: Task 1 - Analysis of Emissions, Meteorological, Ambient, and Air Quality Modeling Data; Task 2 - Emission Inventory Modeling; Task 3 - Air Quality and Meteorological Modeling; Task 4 - Emission Inventory, Meteorological, and Air Quality Modeling Tool Development; Task 5 - Development of Data in Support of Emissions Modeling Tools; and Task 6 - Documentation and Technology Transfer Activities.<br /><br />The incumbent Contractor provides scientific, software, engineering, and analysis support for emissions modeling, air quality modeling and meteorological modeling needs for a variety of pollutants, including, but not limited to, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), PM2.5 component species, ozone, ammonia (NH3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), Lead (Pb), gases contributing to climate change, mercury (Hg), and other air toxics.<br /><br />The current contract, EP-D-12-044, period of performance was extended for six months from September 30, 2017 to March 31, 2018 via Far Clause 52.217-8-Option to Extend Services. The Government intends to compete, negotiate, and award a follow on contract for a one-year base period and four one-year option periods in accordance with the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR). However, due to delays in the acquisition process, the contract for follow on services will not be awarded prior to the current expiration date of March 31, 2018 of contract EP-D-12-044. Since the services of the contract are critical and cannot lapse, the EPA must extend the period of performance of the current contract for an additional six months to allow time for the new follow on contract to be awarded. The EPA intends to negotiate this period of performance extension on a sole source basis.<br /><br />There are no other contractors that have the capability of providing the level, breath, depth of support, and continuity of services that are required by OAQPS for Emissions, Air Quality, and Meteorological modeling.<br /><br />This notice will be posted for 15 calendar days.<br /><br />The intent of this notice alerts the vendor community to the extension of contract EP-D-12-044, and the upcoming opportunity for competition of this opportunity. This notification alerts all vendors to this action and to determine if any other source (s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether competition is viable. Responses to this notice should be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Jeffery Clodfelter via the following e-mail address (Clodfelter.Jeffery@epa.gov) within 15 calendar days from the date of this notice.<br />

<DESC>The project location is at the Guajataca Dam in Northwest Puerto Rico, a rural area, within Isabela and Quebradillas municipalities.
<p>The work to be performed consists of extending the concrete spillway further downstream, which is the emergency overflow for when the dam overtops in flooding events. The spillway is essentially a concrete lined channel with a bottom and two sides. At one side of the spillway is a 42" diameter steel outlet pipe which releases water from behind the dam and requires connecting new piping to existing, constructing a concrete headwall at the outlet, and a cone valve installed for water energy dissipation. The end of the spillway will have a stilling basin for more energy dissipation which high velocity water flowing over the dam slows down, then flows over a concrete weir and out to the river channel. The work at the spillway area includes excavation, backfilling with a 6 " diameter rock fill base, 12" rip rap laid on top and grouted over with high strength flowable fill concrete. To reinforce the existing spillway concrete slabs, an 18" thick concrete slab with dowels and waterstops at the joints will be used as overlay on top of the existing spillway slab. Construction of an asphalt road will be included, as well as reconstruction of the river outlet works channel. Work at the intake tower, where water begins to flow out of the dam in a controlled manner, will include stabilizing an earthen slope with soil anchors and shotcrete to cover it. Other miscellaneous work includes hand rails, grass seeding, cathodic protection for the steel water piping, and buried drainage and weep hole piping.</p>
<p>Quantities include approximately 6,000 cubic yards of concrete, 12,700 cubic yards of grout, 900 square meters of seeding, 300 square meters of shotcrete slope stabilization, 21,000 cubic meters of rock fill, and 11,000 cubic meters of rip rap.</p>
<p>The Total Estimated Period of Performance is 256 Calendar Days from Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>The Estimated Magnitude of construction is between $20,000,000.00 and $40,000,000.00.</p>
<p>This procurement is unrestricted. All responsible offerors are encouraged to participate. The NAICS Code 237990, size standard $36.5 million.</p>
<p>The request for proposal will be issued on or about 28 June 2018 and proposals will be due on or about 30 July 2018.</p>
<p>The award of the contract will be made based on the best value trade off process. The selection criteria will be listed within Section 00100A of the solicitation.</p>
<p>The request for proposal will be issued in electronic format only and will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (Fed Biz Opps) at https://www.fbo.gov.

<p>As part of the mitigation plan, the USACE intends to purchase mitigation credits/acres from approved mitigation bank(s) that meet the eligibility criteria for the Project in order to mitigate for project related impacts. The mitigation bank(s) from which credits/acres will be purchased will be selected through a solicitation process wherein any mitigation bank meeting the eligibility requirements and having a sufficient number of the appropriate resource type of credits/acres may submit a proposal to sell credits/acres. Award will be based on lowest price technically acceptable offer(s).</p>
<p>A mitigation bank must meet all of the following qualifications to be eligible to sell credits<br />to satisfy mitigation requirements. To be considered technically acceptable, the mitigation bank must:</p>
