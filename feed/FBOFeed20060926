<DESC>In accordance with FAR 5.201 (a) (ii) this is to notify that the U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) Mission to Nepal intends to extend the IQC No. 367-I-00-03-00141-00 with The Louis Berger Group, Inc. for an additional nine (9) months for the period from March 14th 2007 to December 31st 2007. The objective of this program, Infrastructure for Income, is to increase rural income by generating employment opportunities through small scale infrastructure projects, green roads, and fish ponds. 

During this nine month extension, the program will continue to use labor intensive low technology approaches to provide jobs for poor Nepalese. During this extension it is anticipated that 12 new work orders with an estimated combined cost of $2,800,000 will be issued. These work orders will be for construction of green roads, mule trails, fish ponds and a drinking water project in rural and some times conflict-affected areas. These activities are expected to provide approximately $1.46 million in wages to rural Nepalese caught up in conflict who would otherwise have little or no alternative source of income.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Procure Using Other Than Full and Open Competition

The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes to enter into a noncompetitive lease procurement using other than full and open competition with the State of Florida for housing of the long term space needs of the United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) in Doral, Florida.  The SOUTHCOM has a need for approximately 700,000 square feet of secured office and related space, and the State of Florida has offered 40 acres of State owned land at no-cost for the development of the needed space using the State's full and open competitive procedures in the selection of the developer/landlord.  The State of Florida has already officially started the procurement process for this proposed project.  More information about the State's procurement process is available by contacting the State of Florida, Departmental Purchasing, Department of Management
Services, 4050 Esplanade Way, Suite 280, Tallahassee, FL 32399-0950.  Due to the size and estimated cost, approval of a prospectus by the United States Congress is required for this proposed action.  Congressional approval has now been granted and GSA will proceed with award of the project to the State of Florida, now estimated to occur by December 22, 2006. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.305, Availability of the Justification, a copy of the justification for other than full and open competition will be made available for public inspection. If you have questions about this proposed procurement, please contact Millie Toro, GSA Contracting Officer, at 400 West Bay Street, Suite 67, Ground Floor, P.O. Box 3, Jacksonville, FL 32202, or by e-mail at: Milagros.Toro@gsa.gov.

<DESC>This project will be a comprehensive evaluation of each program allocation formula, to include analysis and findings on each formula’s consistency with the new NRCS strategic plan; consistency with program statutory authorities and regulatory requirements, and program goals and objectives; technical and analytical defensibility of the formula (parameter and variable selection, formula functional form) and data sources; the efficiency and effectiveness of allocation outcomes as a result of formula.  The evaluation also should examine the impact of Regional Equity on program allocations to states, including its impact nationwide on the efficiency and effectiveness of affected programs.  The deliverable will be used to provide guidance for improvement in allocation formulas, as evidence to support NRCS’s allocation formulas to interested external parties, to provide a template for which to evaluate future allocation formulas, and finally as a means to assess how allocation formulas relate to programmatic efficiency and annual/long-term performance measures.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Titan Group.) under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 48 Hours after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally by considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon the sole source justification document below.



MEMORANDUM FOR 21CONS/LGCBA

Date: 25 September 06

FROM: 21 SCS/SCMTR

SUBJECT:  Justification for Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition Procedures, Titan Group Model 5020-2 dual slot KIV-19 chassis.

1.  This memorandum is provided to the 21st Contraction Squadron as a justification for other than full and open competition for 8 each Titan Group Model 5020-2 dual slot KIV-19 chassis.  Estimated cost for this project is $.

2.  Every effort was made to locate an altenate source of supply for the KIV Dual Mount Chassis with Dual Power Supplies.  Titan Systems was the only vender that has the built in dual power supply to power the KIV-19 crypto devices independently of each other.

3.  Titan currently owns the rights to manufacture these devices, leaving Titan Systems as the sole source for chassis with built in dual power supplies.  Our research found that there was one other manufacturer of KIV-19 chassis, but they only have a single removable power supply model.  If this power supply were to fail, both cryptos would be affected. 
 
4.  There is nothing the Government can do to direct the design of these two manufacturers.

5.  I certify that the justification for the above request is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; and that the anticipated cost to the Government is fair and reasonable.

<DESC>The Government of Jordan (GOJ) has requested USAID to
continue with a major program that can assist in
enhancing Jordan's competitiveness in global markets,
deepen the public sector reform process and increase
the number of jobs available for Jordanians in the
economy.  A five year program known as the Sustainable Achievement of Business Expansion and Quality (SABEQ) has been designed to address this need. 

The GOJ and USAID agree that: 

1) there are significant second generation regulatory
and legal reforms that must be made in order to
enhance Jordan's ability to attract increased local
and foreign direct investment; 

2) the private sector remains dominated by small and
medium enterprises that have not yet adopted modern
management principles and are not investing in the
necessary research and development or marketing
themselves in order to become competitive in a global
economy; and 

3) weak capacity in both the public and private
sectors reduces the number of new jobs being created
that are needed to grow the economy.  Based on seven
years of successes during the implementation of the
AMIR program, it was decided to develop another
large-scale economic growth program that would build
on lessons learned, adopt new approaches to suit the
changing environment in Jordan, and promote the Jordan
National Agenda (JNA) reform plan.

SABEQ is proposed as part of USAID/Jordan's Strategic Objective 10 (SO10): "Improved Economic Opportunities for Jordanians".  The program will directly support all three Intermediate Results: 

IR 1: "More Transparent, Efficient and Responsive Public Sector"; 

IR 2: "More Effective Legal and Regulatory Environment"; and 

IR 3: "Increased Depth of Private Sector Growth".  

To address these problems, SABEQ will work with both
the public and private sectors to achieve two
principle goals: 1) increasing the number of jobs
available to Jordanians; and 2) enhancing Jordan's competitiveness.

The SABEQ Program will have four components as
described below.  Woven through each one will be a
public outreach activity and a small grants program. 
Under each component, there will be both public and
private sector activities and opportunities for both
sectors to engage with one another.

- Financial Integrity and Oversight, and Broadened Capital Markets 

- Removal of GOJ Constraints to Achieving Private Sector Competitiveness

- Expanded Trade and Investment

- Enhanced Productivity (Improved People/Improved Product)

<CONTACT>Stacy Figlinski 850-235-5842 , or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) is requesting proposals for full and open competition for the production of the Target Detecting Device (TDD) MK 71 Mod 1 on a firm fixed price basis.  This effort will provide for design, first article and production hardware, data, and engineering support services with a base year and four option years. The TDD MK 71 Mod 1 is a component of an air delivered, underwater mine assembly.  The TDD is a multiple influence sensor that uses a Navy-supplied target detection algorithm to determine the presence of a valid target and to generate a firing signal response.  It is powered by a battery and contains target sensors and the electronics that determine when the mine detonates.  The algorithm determines whether or not a valid target is present by processing sensor input data based upon timing, period, and amplitude.  When a valid target is detected, the algorithm issues a command to detonate the mine.  The TDD is highly sweep-resistant and is sized to fit all three QUICKSTRIKE warheads (MK 82/83 general purpose bombs and the Mk 65 Mine case).  The QUICKSTRIKE Mod 3, with the TDD MK 71 Mod 1, will provide the Fleet with a programmable target detection device that will help ensure optimized mine performance against changing target threats or changing countermeasures tactics.   The Government anticipates releasing the formal Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about June 22, 2006.  If you wish to receive an RFP package send your request to the Contract Specialist by email at Stacy.Figlinski@navy.mil by June 20, 2006.  Provide the following information:  company name, address, CAGE code, status as U.S. based company, name and phone number for a point of contact at your company.  NAICS code is 334511, FSC code is 5999, SBA size standard is 750 employees.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) to conduct a second phase of repository activity for animal models of Type 1 Diabetes and its complications. 

After consideration of corporate capability statements of firms interested in providing these services it has been determined that to begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government, as well as unacceptable delays and loss of consistency in data describing disease incidence and severity. 

To the best of our knowledge Jackson Labs is the only responsible source that can satisfy the Agency?s requirement because (1) Jackson Labs houses and maintains the archives of critical previously collected animal strains and data, (2) has extensive experience necessary to conduct activities proposed for the current contract; and (3) no other source can supply the services that will satisfy agency requirements for the follow-on work for this effort. 

Development of the original repository, the Type 1 Diabetes Repository at Jackson Labs (T1DR; http://www.jax.org/t1dr/index.html) was initiated in 2001 and supported by NIDDK through a supplement to an existing NCRR resource, the Induced Mutant Repository (IMR). Strain importation and associated studies and data collection were begun in 2001. To date, the T1DR has imported and archived nearly 150 strains important for diabetes research, and distributed over 500 mice to 100 independent investigators.  In addition, disease incidence studies have been performed on nearly 20 of the imported recombinant strains within the context of Jackson Labs vivarium conditions. This ability to measure the impact of genetic changes on Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) within the context of the common and consistent environment provided within the Jackson Labs vivarium was a necessary and critical component of T1DR research activity in the prior project phase that must be maintained to provide consistency of results in Phase II. Finally, the ability of Jackson Laboratories to distribute T1DR-archived strains to investigators in most cases without the need for additional quarantine procedures beyond what is required for receipt of commercially available JAX strains is necessary to expedite and maximize the efficiency of research.   

For cost and efficiency purposes, NIDDK plans to continue the second phase of the T1DR using a single contractor (Jackson Laboratories). The contractor will continue activities to help identify mouse strains of unique value to T1D research, will import and archive these strains, will verify disease incidence and severity in a subset of the imported strains under controlled housing conditions, and will facilitate limited distribution of mice to the scientific community. In addition, the contractor will provide strain development support services for the NIDDK-funded Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium. This activity will require production, housing, phenotyping, archiving, and distribution of mouse strains important for advancing research in diabetic complications. 

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, The Jackson Laboratories is the only source capable of performing this requirement due to their unique vivarium conditions and distribution capabilities, and prerequisite knowledge, experience and existing data generated through work performed under the prior supplement provided by NIDDK to the NCRR Induced Mutant Resource grant.

Although it is our intentions to make award to Jackson Laboratories, all interested parties may submit a response to the Request for Proposal (RFP) which shall be released on or about October 10, 2006. Responses will be due no later than November 9, 2006.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Carlos Rene Flores, Division de Planificacion, 2do Piso, Edificio Administrativo, Empresa Nacional Portuaria, 1era Avenida, 1era. Calle Puerto Cortes, Honduras, Central America Tel: (504) 665 - 0110 Fax: (504) 665 - 1402      Port of Cortes Dry Bulk Unloading Terminal Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Port of Cortes Dry Bulk Unloading Terminal Project.

The Port of Cortes is the premier Caribbean port for the Central American region, handling the majority of trade from Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador that is bound for the eastern U.S. and European markets.  In recent years the Port of Cortes has seen substantial growth in cargo volume.

Although the Port of Cortes is controlled by Empresa Nacional Portuaria de Honduras (ENP), operations are a mixture of port personnel and private stevedores. ENP recently entered a contract with an American firm for the implementation and operation of an aggregate export facility but the Port lacks the infrastructure and space for an import, or unloading facility.   The export berth operations are operating at 65% capacity, which is generally the economic limit allowing time for delays in ship arrival or other operations.  Therefore, there is not enough "free time" for other operations, such as imports.   In 2005 alone, dry bulk imports grew by 19%.  

ENP currently controls the importation of these commodities in the port, using ships' gear, portable hoppers and many trucks from the export terminal.   Private companies execute the stevedoring operations using their own equipment and ships' gear.  Hauling the cargo away by truck creates serious congestion and numerous delays. Furthermore, open or closed storage for unloaded dry bulk commodities is not available.  

The construction of a dry bulk unloading terminal is the number one priority for ENP.  The feasibility study is needed to establish realistic performance criteria for the terminal operation, with contractual arrangements that are in the long-term best interest of Honduras.

The objective of this feasibility study is to provide operational guidance and performance criteria to establish an effective working relationship between the ENP and private groups interested in developing the dry bulk unloading terminal.  Implementation of this Project would expand and modernize dry bulk unloading infrastructure, lessen congestion and improve the overall efficiency of port operations.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $470,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>This is a request for quotation (RFQ) under subject reference number.  The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW/A7KI) intends to purchase, on a competitive basis, 35 each of the AccessData Ultimate Toolkit.  Information Operations and Investigations agents throughout the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) use this software which excels at email analysis, messenger analysis and file indexing.  Justification for the brand name is supported because this is specialized forensics software.  It is most cost effective to obtain AccessData maintenance, licenses and upgrades than to have similar software developed by another source.  NAIC is 443120 with a size standard of $8M.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.  Vendors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration. Closing date for quotations is 12:00 pm Eastern-Standard time on 28 Sep 06.  Award of this action will take place on or about 30 Sep 06.

<SUBJECT>C -- HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING AND RELATED SUPPORT SERVICES
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NCNJ3000-6-00019LDB

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  NOAA has a requirement for hydrographic surveying services to support its nautical charting mission. It is contemplated that zero, one, or more contracts will be awarded. Although each contract will have a nationwide scope, vendors are particularly sought with specific capability to satisfy NOAAs hydrographic survey needs in three distinct geographic areas: (1) the navigable waters of Alaska, including remote areas, bays, and harbors, (2) the Gulf of Mexico, and (3) all other navigable waters of the U.S., including the east coast, Pacific, the Great Lakes and U.S. territories. Each indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract will have a five year term. Task orders will be issued against the resulting contracts based on available funding. The cumulative value of the task orders issued against the resulting contract(s) will not exceed $250 million.  Notwithstanding the $250 million ceiling, the current annual funding for this program is estimated to be approximately $30 million.  

Task orders under the resulting contracts may consist of but are not limited to: 1) acquiring shallow water multibeam sounding data; 2) acquiring side scan sonar data; 3) acquiring vertical beam echosounder data; 4) determining positions and least depths on hazards to navigation; 5) installing, operating, and removing water level (tide) stations; 6) acquiring related supporting data (e.g. water level correctors, velocity of sound in the water column, vessel motion correctors, bottom sediment samples, etc.); 7) processing the data, including tidal tabulation, computation of tidal datums, tidal zoning determination, applying water level, vessel motion, and velocity of sound correctors to determine the true depths, correlating sonar targets, and compiling reports, final smooth sheets, and digital data; and 8) performing quality control during data acquisition and processing; and 9) the delivery of the data, reports, and sheets to NOAA for archival and application to the nautical charts and associated nautical products. All work shall be performed to NOAA specifications and the data provided in NOAA specified formats. See http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/hsd/specs/specs.htm for typical technical specifications and a description of the deliverables. The project instructions will tailor these specifications for each task order issued. A quality control plan will be a contract requirement. Firms responding are encouraged to review the technical specifications and the description of deliverables before responding to this announcement. The resulting contracts will permit a Government COTR or observer to be present during shipboard operations. If the contractor conducts vessel operations overnight, the contractor will be required to provide meals and accommodations to the Government COTR or observer.  

SELECTION CRITERIA: Firms must provide sufficient surveying vessel(s) and equipment and sufficient technical, supervisory, and administrative personnel to ensure expeditious execution of work assignments. Utilization of small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small businesses will be one of the evaluation factors in the selection process. To be considered for selection, a firm must demonstrate surveying experience in the types of surveys stated above and have on payroll at least two hydrographers and a tides/water level specialist. The two hydrographers must each have a minimum of three years experience in hydrographic surveying and demonstrated experience in surveying using shallow water multibeam sonar system, vertical beam echosounder, side scan sonar system and interpreting the data. The tides/water level specialist must have demonstrated experience in measurement of tides and water levels, tidal datums, and tidal zoning and their application to hydrographic surveying. Firms must show the availability of a suitable survey vessel(s) that complies with applicable U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, OSHA, and other federal regulations; data acquisition and processing systems; vertical beam echosounder system(s); shallow water multibeam sonar system(s) capable of detecting contacts measuring 2m x 2m x 1m high; side scan sonar system(s) that can detect a 1m x 1m x 1m target and with the capability to record data digitally; GPS surveying equipment for establishing horizontal control; differential GPS equipment for vessel positioning; water level measurement gauges; and equipment for determining velocity of sound in the water column. Evaluation factors, in descending order of importance, are: (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time (personnel and equipment); (4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules; (5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of work in diverse types of localities in the U.S.; (6) Proposed plans and goals to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities on this project to small, small-disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. Evaluation criteria #6 will not apply to small business firms because subcontracting plans are not required from those concerns pursuant to FAR 19.702(b). An adjectival method will be used to rate each factor: Exceptional: The submission exceeded evaluation standards; has no significant weaknesses; reflects a high probability of satisfying the requirements. Acceptable: The submission met evaluation standards; any weakness can be readily corrected; reflects a good probability of satisfying the requirements. Marginal: The submission failed to meet minimum evaluation standards; has significant, but correctable deficiencies; reflects a low probability of satisfying the requirements. Unacceptable: The submission failed to meet the minimum standards; has a low probability of satisfying the requirements; reflects significant performance risk. Subsequent to the initial evaluation, those firms that are considered most highly qualified may be scheduled for interviews. Responding firms are required to state whether they are small, small disadvantaged business, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small business. Responding firms are encouraged to use small business concerns in a meaningful manner in the execution of this project. Large business firms should demonstrate their commitment and discuss proposed plans to provide subcontracting opportunities to the small business community in the performance of this project. Specific abilities and disciplines required include (but are not limited to): Project Manager, Hydrographer, Tides/Water Level Specialist, Land Surveyor, and GIS Specialist (Geographers/Cartographer/Geospatial Data Analyst). Firms should indicate their experience using a shallow water multibeam survey system and an outline of how the Prime contractor will manage their team to ensure that quality products are delivered to NOAA. For evaluation factor (3) Capacity, a list of key personnel demonstrating their availability for the project considering other commitments and major equipment available for project assignment must be provided along with other pertinent data. 

SUBMISSION: Responsible sources may submit a response for consideration by NOAA. Prime contractors shall respond to this announcement for their teams. The prime contractor shall submit one original plus three copies of its teams response to this synopsis. The response shall consist of Standard Form 330 (SF330) and other material not to exceed 100 pages in total. Copies of the SF330, instructions for completing the SF330, and continuation pages can be obtained through the General Services Administrations forms directory at: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do Each original submission and copy shall be bound (e.g. 3-ring binder, GBC comb binding, etc.). Carefully read and follow the instructions printed on the SF330. The teams qualifications for this project should be presented in Part I of the form. Responding firms must submit a separate Part II General Qualifications of the SF330 for each firm that will be part of the team proposed for this contract. Evaluation criteria (3) Capacity, (5) Locality, and (6) Subcontracting as defined above should be addressed in Part I, Section H, Block 30 of the SF330. Responses (SF330s) are due to the following address no later than 1:00 pm eastern time, October 30, 2006: U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA, NOS/NMFS/OAR Acquisition Management Division (OFA65), Attn: Linda Brainard, 1305 East-West Hwy., SSMC#4 Station 7607, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3282.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric distribution system, the water distribution system and the wastewater collection system at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, a firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  
The Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation: Fort Belvoir
Location: Fort Belvoir, Virginia
Installation Description: Located in Fairfax County, near Alexandria, Virginia, Fort Belvoir covers approximately 8,600 acres.  Fort Belvoir’s daytime population is estimated to include more than 12,000 personnel: 3,000 active duty military personnel and 9,000 civilians.
Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.	Water Distribution System:
Fort Belvoir is supplied with potable water from the Fairfax County Water Authority (FCWA). Other than chlorination of water on an as needed basis, there is no water treatment at Fort Belvoir. Fort Belvoir’s potable water distribution system connects to FCWA’s main at four locations and there is one supply point that is dedicated to the Golf Course Maintenance Facility (Building 2990).
The potable water distribution system consists of pipe sizes ranging from less than 2 inches to 30 inches. The total length of the pipes is approximately 446,667 linear feet.  The water pipes are at an average depth of 3 to 4 feet. There are four water storage tanks. All tanks are of steel construction installed in 1948. The valves and piping at the tanks were upgraded in 1994. The tanks were stripped of lead paint and repainted in 1995 and 1996.

b.	Wastewater Collection System 
Fort Belvoir’s wastewater collection system includes 34 lift stations and approximately 389,122 feet of pipe/force mains. There is no wastewater treatment facility at the Base. All the wastewater is conveyed to Fairfax County Department of Public Works (FCDPW) for treatment. The wastewater is metered at seven location and flows into FCDPW’s mains at six connection points.
The sizes of collection pipes range from 4 inches in diameter to 24 inches in diameter with the majority of the pipe size being 8 inches, as summarized in Table 1. The large majority of the pipe is PVC type. Also, within the sewer collection system are 1,173 manholes. Most of the wastewater collection system was constructed between the 1940s and the 1990s, with only replacement and upgrade work being completed since 1997. The upgrade work included relining of pipes, upgrading of manholes, and some pipe replacement. 
There are 34 lift stations and associated force mains within the wastewater collection system at Belvoir. The length of the associated force mains is summarized in Table 1. Figures 3.1.2.1.a through 3.1.2.1.f depict several of the lift stations and their components.
Wastewater is collected at the Woodlawn Village housing area by gravity flow pipes, metered and transferred to FCDPW main. Wastewater from HQ DLA is metered at the Accotink and Route No. 1 and flows into FCDPW main. At the same location there is another flow meter and line, which conveys wastewater from the Airfield. Wastewater collected from other buildings north of Route No. 1, is metered and flows into FCDPW main at Guston Road and Route No. 1. Wastewater collected from buildings located south of Route No. 1 flows to Lift Station 687 or to Lift Station 97. Both of these lift stations replaced old wastewater treatment plants at Ft. Belvoir in the early 1980s. The holding tanks of the old wastewater treatment plant are still used. The pumps in the lift stations were installed to take the wastewater treatment plants out of service and transfer the wastewater to FCDPW main. Both the lift stations have wastewater meters. 

c.	Electrical Distribution System 
The primary distribution system consists of a total of approximately 90 circuit miles of 4.16 kV, 12.5 kV, 22.9 kV, and 34.5 kV circuits.  The majority of the distribution circuits are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits.  The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (which is conventional, open wire/wood crossarm construction) with pole-mounted transformer banks.  However, there is also a substantial amount of underground primary construction, utilizing both direct burial and duct type construction practices.
Fort Belvoir currently purchases bulk electrical power at 34.5 kV from Dominion Virginia Power (DVP) at Substation 2540 (Humphrey's Substation), located near the northeast corner of the base.
Fort Belvoir owns and operates an electrical utility system consisting of:
·	Four 34.5 kV subtransmission switching stations
·	One 34.5 – 22.9 kV subtransmission substation
·	Eight 4.16 kV distribution substations
·	One 12.5 kV distribution substation
·	Approximately 70 circuit miles of overhead primary distribution line
·	Approximately 19 circuit miles of underground primary distribution line
The electrical utility system consists of two 34.5 kV feeders supplying four 34.5 kV overhead feeders.  The 34.5 kV feeders serve as both distribution supply circuits and as sub-transmission circuits supplying one 34.5 - 22.9 kV sub-transmission substation, four 4.16 kV distribution substations, and one 12.5 kV distribution substation.  The 34.5 - 22.9 kV sub-transmission substation is the point of supply for two 22.9 kV sub-transmission circuits which then supply four 4.16 kV distribution substations.
The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Megan Oz at 703-767-9411 to be added to our bidder mailing list.  
A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL.  The solicitation will be available on or after March 24, 2004.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric distribution system, the water distribution system and the wastewater collection system at Fort Myer, Virginia and Fort McNair, Washington D.C.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  

The Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:

Installation: Fort McNair

Location: Fort McNair, Washington D.C.

Installation Description: Fort McNair is a U.S. Army Installation located in the southwestern portion of the District of Columbia, very convenient to the National Airport and the Pentagon. Approximately 1,000 military personnel work within the Installation’s 98 acres.

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.	Electrical Description:
Ft. McNair is supplied 13.8 kV electrical power from two Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) feeders, No. 14639 and 14642, at 4th and P Streets, and a second service is supplied separately by PEPCO feeders, No. 14637 and 14639, at switchgear near 2nd and T Streets, which serves only Building 62, Marshall Hall.  All PEPCO feeders originate at Buzzard Point generating station ‘B’.  The main Installation feeders terminate in a government-owned, medium voltage set of switchgear located in a “sheltered aisle double row” enclosure adjacent to P Street. The installation has approximately 44,000 linear feet of electrical distribution lines.

The original 1922 street lighting at Fort McNair has been replaced and includes protective equipment and magnetic contactor with photoelectric cell controls in several existing distribution vaults, as well as new cables and supplementary new distribution ducts.  The former series street lighting standards were converted so each unit includes a regulated ballast, and a single 100-watt mercury vapor lamp.  The existing system is generally adequate to support present facilities.  Street lighting provides adequate light for both vehicles and pedestrians.  A 16-foot high standard light fixture is used along streets and paths at Fort McNair.  Spacing of light standards on primary streets is 80-feet on center.  On secondary streets, lights are spaced at 150-feet on center. In large parking lots and recreational facilities, 25-30 foot tall light standards are utilized.

b.	Wastewater System Description
The wastewater system at Fort McNair consists of gravity sewer collection system within the Fort McNair boundaries. There are no wastewater lift stations or treatment facilities within Fort McNair. All wastewater generated within Fort McNair flows by gravity to one of five connection points to the District of Columbia sewer system. Two of the connection points are at the northern installation boundary and connect to the District of Columbia 12/15 inch line along P Street. The western most connection along P Street serves approximately 10 non-family type buildings located in the northwestern section of Fort McNair. The eastern most connection serves the remaining northern non-family type buildings, the family housing along 4th Avenue, and the 10 most northern family housing units along 2nd.  Two other connections to the District of Columbia system are along 2nd Street. One of these connections is only for Building 62 and the other serves family housing along 2nd Avenue and four non-family housing building. The final connection to the District of Columbia system is near the intersection of V Street and 5th Avenue. This connection serves Buildings 59 and 61.  The entire wastewater distribution system is approximately 13,000 linear feet in length and varies in pipe size from 2.5 – 12 inches.

c.  Water System Description
The water distribution system at Fort McNair consists of water mains, fire hydrants, and isolation valves within the Fort McNair installation.  There are no booster pump stations, storage tanks or treatment facilities within Fort McNair, nor are any required. The District of Columbia Department of Environmental Services supplies water to the Installation. 

The water system within the Installation is operated and maintained by Installation personnel. The water distribution system in Fort McNair was upgraded in 1988. 

The water system within Fort McNair provides water for both domestic and fire protection use. With few exceptions, lines are located adjacent to roadways and fire hydrants readily accessible and each fire hydrant has its own isolation valve. Isolation valves are located near most pipe intersections making it easy to isolate portions of the system. The normal distribution pressure is approximately 55 pounds per square inch (psi) and is adequate for fire protection since the majority of the buildings are under three stories.  The water distribution system for the installation is approximately 17,000 linear feet in length.

Installation: Fort Myer

Location: Fort Myer, Virginia

Installation Description: Fort Myer is a U.S. Army Installation situated along a high bluff just west of the city of Washington, D.C., directly across the Potamac River and contiguous to the western boundary of Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.  Electrical Description
Ft. Myer currently purchases wholesale electrical power at 13.8 kV from Dominion Virginia  Power Company (DVP) at a single delivery point, the Main Switching Station, Building 215.

The switching station was constructed in 1993 and consists of 13.8 kV metal clad switchgear housed in a brick/masonry building, (see Ft. Myer 13.8 KV Single Line diagram at the back of this section).  The switchgear is configured as two 13.8 kV, 1200A, 3-phase bus sections.  Bus No. 1 is normally supplied from DVP Feeder No. 14646 (891) via a 1200A, 13.8 kV, 500 MVA vacuum circuit breaker with a second incoming circuit breaker for emergency supply from DVP Feeder No. 14649 (907).  Bus No. 2 is supplied from DVP Feeder No. 14647 (896) in the same configuration as bus No. 1.  DVP feeder No. 14649 supplies the emergency circuit breaker on each bus and automatically closes when normal power is lost from feeders 14646 or 14647.

The Fort Myer electric distribution system consists of four independent 13.8 kV underground feeders numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Each feeder supplies power to its own set of buildings throughout the Installation.  The feeders are organized in two pairs.  Feeders 1 and 2 are a pair, as are Feeders 3 and 4.  At the end of each pair is a normally open loop-switch that, if closed, electrically connects the pair of feeders into a single loop.  Feeders No. 1 and 2 can be tied by closing a normally open, loop feed switch at TV-5.  Similarly, post feeders No. 3 and 4 can be tied by closing loop feed switches at NTV-18 and NTV-20.  These four feeders are in underground ducts throughout the Installation and supply power to 63 transformer stations. 

The underground feeders were installed in 1967.  The conductor material was not indicated on the drawings, however, previous studies indicated that the primary feeders are, primarily, #4/0 copper or 350 KCM aluminum with XLP insulation.  According to the Department of Public Works & Logistics (DPWL) personnel, approximately 25% of the current feeder cabling inventory is newer, having been replaced or added to, however, the areas served by the newer cabling was not identified in any of the information provided. A Study performed on the Fort Myer electric distribution system in 1996 by STV/Lyon Associates stated, “The capacity of the four government owned feeders is, theoretically, 6600 KVA (290 A) each.”  The Study further observed that, due to their age, “... the dielectric strength of the insulation has probably decreased to some extent, therefore they should not be loaded to maximum capacity.”

The 13.8 kV underground feeders are installed in Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) ductbanks ranging from 1x1 to 2x3 ductbanks and generally four or more feet deep.  The manholes are a mixture of brick, poured-in-place and pre-cast.  The manholes range in size from 4’x6’x5’ to 8’x10’x6’.  While recent surveys have found the manholes to be in generally good condition, many manholes are subject to fill or partially fill with water, which has led to cable or splice failures.

b.  Wastewater Collection System
The wastewater system at Fort Myer consists of the collection system and two lift stations.   Fort Myer does not have any sewage treatment facilities.  All wastewater generated is transferred to Arlington County (County) for treatment.
The wastewater collection system dates back to the 1950s.  The pipe materials are terra cotta, cast iron, and PVC (polyvinylchloride). In recent years PVC pipe has been used in new construction and pipe replacement.  All wastewater facilities are owned, operated, and maintained by Fort Myer personnel.

There are four discharge points through which the collected wastewater exits the Installation boundary and ultimately reaches the County for treatment. One of this discharge points is located on the west side of the Installation and flows directly to the County’s system. Two discharge points are located on the east of the Installation through which the collected wastewater flows through Arlington Cemetery system. The fourth connection point is on the south end of the Installation by which the collected sewer discharges to the Henderson Hall area system that is owned and operated by the U.S Marine Corps.

c.  Water System Description
The potable water system at Fort Myer consists only of a water distribution system and no water treatment facility.

Fort Myer is supplied with potable water from two independent sources; one is the Washington Aqueduct Division and the other is Arlington County, Virginia Department of Public Works.

There is only one potable water pump house in Fort Myer.  There are three pumps in the pump house.  All three pumps are of 1930 construction and have 2,300 Volt motors. The pump switchgears were upgraded in 2001. The pumps are very old and the motor voltage is unique that finding spare parts is very difficult. The pumps failed in 2000 and from that time the Installation uses water from the Arlington County only. The pumps are housed in a 30’x 22’ x 10’ building.

There is one water storage tank at the Installation. In 1998 the tank was stripped of old paint and repainted. The tank operates at a reduced capacity of 350,000 gallons as the tank overflows beyond this capacity.

When the water source is from the County the water pressure is greater than the hydraulic grade of the tank. Therefore, the tank does not operate with the Installation distribution system. To overcome this, the tank is manually operated to periodically drain the tank and fill it to keep the tank water fresh.

Installation personnel operate the potable water distribution system. Currently the primary water source is Arlington County and the county supply delivers sufficient water pressure to serve the Installation’s distribution system, operated at 80 to 85 psi.  The system is approximately 49,000 linear feet in length and varies in size from less than 2 inches to 12 inches.

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Megan Oz at 703-767-9411 to be added to our bidder mailing list.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The evaluation also should examine the impact of Regional Equity on program allocations to states, including its impact nationwide on the efficiency and effectiveness of affected programs.  The deliverable will be used to provide guidance for improvement in allocation formulas, as evidence to support NRCS’s allocation formulas to interested external parties, to provide a template for which to evaluate future allocation formulas, and finally as a means to assess how allocation formulas relate to programmatic efficiency and annual/long-term performance measures.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) to conduct a second phase of repository activity for animal models of Type 1 Diabetes and its complications. 

After consideration of corporate capability statements of firms interested in providing these services it has been determined that to begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government, as well as unacceptable delays and loss of consistency in data describing disease incidence and severity. 

To the best of our knowledge Jackson Labs is the only responsible source that can satisfy the Agency?s requirement because (1) Jackson Labs houses and maintains the archives of critical previously collected animal strains and data, (2) has extensive experience necessary to conduct activities proposed for the current contract; and (3) no other source can supply the services that will satisfy agency requirements for the follow-on work for this effort. 

Development of the original repository, the Type 1 Diabetes Repository at Jackson Labs (T1DR; http://www.jax.org/t1dr/index.html) was initiated in 2001 and supported by NIDDK through a supplement to an existing NCRR resource, the Induced Mutant Repository (IMR). Strain importation and associated studies and data collection were begun in 2001. To date, the T1DR has imported and archived nearly 150 strains important for diabetes research, and distributed over 500 mice to 100 independent investigators.  In addition, disease incidence studies have been performed on nearly 20 of the imported recombinant strains within the context of Jackson Labs vivarium conditions. This ability to measure the impact of genetic changes on Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) within the context of the common and consistent environment provided within the Jackson Labs vivarium was a necessary and critical component of T1DR research activity in the prior project phase that must be maintained to provide consistency of results in Phase II. Finally, the ability of Jackson Laboratories to distribute T1DR-archived strains to investigators in most cases without the need for additional quarantine procedures beyond what is required for receipt of commercially available JAX strains is necessary to expedite and maximize the efficiency of research.   

For cost and efficiency purposes, NIDDK plans to continue the second phase of the T1DR using a single contractor (Jackson Laboratories). The contractor will continue activities to help identify mouse strains of unique value to T1D research, will import and archive these strains, will verify disease incidence and severity in a subset of the imported strains under controlled housing conditions, and will facilitate limited distribution of mice to the scientific community. In addition, the contractor will provide strain development support services for the NIDDK-funded Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium. This activity will require production, housing, phenotyping, archiving, and distribution of mouse strains important for advancing research in diabetic complications. 

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, The Jackson Laboratories is the only source capable of performing this requirement due to their unique vivarium conditions and distribution capabilities, and prerequisite knowledge, experience and existing data generated through work performed under the prior supplement provided by NIDDK to the NCRR Induced Mutant Resource grant.

Although it is our intentions to make award to Jackson Laboratories, all interested parties may submit a response to the Request for Proposal (RFP) which shall be released on or about October 10, 2006. Responses will be due no later than November 9, 2006.

FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514

TITLE:  Information Institute Research Program

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement 

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 06-01-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 1 March 06; FY 07 by 1 March 07 (see below for separate recommended date for focus area entitled Visualizing Situations); and FY 08 by 1 March 08. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 31 December 2008, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.   

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Research areas of interest include innovative approaches, basic and exploratory research projects in the area of information science and technology. Information science and technology areas of interest include but are not limited to: Information Exploitation; Information Fusion & Understanding; Information Management including JBI & Collaborative Environments; Advanced Computing Architecture including Biocomputing & Quantum Computing; Cyber Operations, active & passive; Command & Control including Effects Based Operations & Decision Sciences; Connectivity including Integrated Transmission & Exploitation. Efforts that will be performed as part of the Information Institute (II) Research Program are intended to be collaborative university efforts designed to provide AFRL/IF with leading edge research that can be applied to a variety of AFRL/IF & Air Force needs. Universities conducting research as part of the II are encouraged to work collaboratively with other institutions and to leverage on-going AFRL/IF research programs and activities. Additionally, AFRL/IF has an active Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions Program. Hence, research proposals from HBCU/MI may be funded from special funds that may be set aside by the II Director. Supplemental information regarding each of the seven research areas is available upon request by e-mail from: Anna.Lemaire@rl.af.mil. 
Visualizing Situations.  This topic area solicits white papers to explore visualization technologies that will enhance or enable a human analyst's 'mental model' of a situation in such a way as to provide the analyst the ability to completely understand the situation, the immediate ability to assess the situation, and to quickly and accurately determine a response to shape the situation.

Situational Awareness (SA) is "the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning and the projection of their status in the near future" (Endsley, 1988).  The manner in which the data is presented to a human will shape that person's 'mental model'.

The ability to understand the evolving situations are critical for a decision maker.  One of the primary means of gaining that understanding is through the visualization of current objects (information on location and identification).  Existing visualization techniques are adequate for providing geospatial views of individual objects in low density environments.  For example, in the military environment, the visualization of vehicles and aircraft provides an analyst a view of the environment.  As the density of objects increases, the individual objects can be clustered together to form military groups which are then visualized using standard military symbology (MILSTD2525B) icons.  Similarly in the cyber domain, individual alerts can be clustered to form tracks.  However there is an enormous gap in the ability to provide visualizations for other than individual and clustered objects.

Visualizing Situations Scope:  We seek cost-effective approaches to situation visualization tools that are easily adaptable to different modeling techniques and that possess a 'pluggable' interface to enable integration.  The visualization approach should be domain independent, but it is suggested that the Cyber domain be used as a starting point.  We encourage a multidisciplinary collaboration between industry and academia lead teams.  Awards under this topic area will not normally exceed twelve (12) months with an approximate face value of $150K per award.  

The technical point of contact for this topic area is Mr. George Tadda, AFRL/IFEA, 315-330-3957, email George.Tadda@rl.af.mil.  It is recommended that white papers for this additional topic area be provided by 15 November 2006 and sent electronically to:  George.Tadda@rl.af.mil.  

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $3M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $1M; FY 07 - $1M. Additional funding of $1M for FY08/FY09 is also being pursued.  Each award is limited to approximately $100,000 to $300,000 in value with a duration of not more than thirty six (36) months.  The total value of all efforts awarded under this BAA will not exceed $3 million.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, co-operative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) The scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal; (2) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques; and (3) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any.  Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.  

3.  The Government may use the services of JAG Technologies in an advisory role in the technical evaluation of white papers and/or proposals. The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government. Representatives of the foregoing firm who review the white papers and/or proposals will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. If the offeror desires the cited firm be excluded from access to information contained in its white paper and/or proposal, offeror must so indicate in a letter of transmittal accompanying the document. 

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.   Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 
Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Those white papers that are found to be consistent with the BAA and are invited to submit a technical and cost proposal will be required to do so through Grants.gov if the following conditions apply:  (1) the award will be in the form of a grant or co-operative agreement and (2) the offeror chooses to submit the proposal electronically.  As a prerequisite to submitting an electronic proposal, there are several one-time actions that must be taken in order to submit an application/proposal through Grants.gov (e.g. obtain a Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, register with the Central Contract Registry (CCR), register with the credential provider, and register with Grants.gov).  See www.grants.gov/GetStarted.  Use the Grants.gov Organization Registration Checklist at http://www.grants.gov/section3/OrganizationRegCheck.pdf to guide you through the process.  Designating an E-Business Point of Contact (EBiz POC) and obtaining a special password called MPIN are important in the CCR registration process.  Applicants, who are not registered with CCR and Grants.gov should allow at least 21 days to complete these requirements.  It is suggested that the process be started as soon as possible.  In order to download the application package, you will need to install PureEdge Viewer.  This small, free program will allow you to access, complete, and submit applications electronically and securely.  For a free version of the software, visit the following website: www.grants.gov/DownloadViewer.  Should you have questions relating to the registration process, system requirements, how an application form works or the submittal process you must direct those questions to Grants.gov at 1-800-518-4726 or support@grants.gov.  Detailed instructions for submitting a proposal through Grant.gov APPLY will be provided at the time a proposal is requested should the offeror choose to submit electronically.  

2.  REPORTING:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>1.  COMPREHENSIVE LARGE ARRAY-DATA STEWARDSHIP SYSTEM (CLASS) INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SERVICES
The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) plans to establish a contract for Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) Information Technology (IT) support services.  The Government anticipates awarding a performance-based contract to support the development, engineering, integration, test, operations, and maintenance of CLASS and the Archive, Access and Distribution System (AADS).  This anticipated competitive acquisition is a reissue of a previously cancelled COMMITS NexGEN Program Request for Solution (T3-0005).  This notice supersedes all previous notices including the notice provided at: http://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOC/NOAA/AGAMD/CLASS070000035/SynopsisP.html.     

2.  SCOPE OF WORK
The CLASS contractor will meet requirements for the planning, development, and subsequent operations and maintenance of a secure, highly reliable, and evolutionary environmental data storage and distribution system.  These requirements are integral to NOAA mission accomplishment.  Contractor support in Information Technology (IT) and IT related services is critical to the CLASS program business function.  As a Performance-Based Acquisition, this contract provides for the contractor s payment and incentives to be based on meeting service levels necessary to efficiently and economically support NESDIS in maintaining and evolving CLASS. 

NOAA seeks a contractor that will bring a mission focus providing highly effective, secure and reliable computing and communications resources.  Further, the successful contractor must also continuously identify methods for applying information technology to improve mission performance and reduce total program costs (i.e., Life Cycle Cost).  NOAA seeks a contractor that brings proven expertise to identify, implement, and manage effective and efficient application and use of information technology to meet the CLASS mission. 

3.  BACKGROUND
The CLASS program will enable NESDIS to better meet NOAA s responsibility for long-term archiving of the Nation s environmental data.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is responsible for archival storage and management of environmental data and information, and has hundreds of millions of environmental observations stored on a variety of media dating back as far as the mid-1890s.  These data support the Nation s ability to ensure human safety and welfare, sustain economic stability and growth, and maintain environmental integrity.  The ability to archive, integrate, access, and distribute environmental data and information is critical to the fulfillment of NOAA strategic goals.  Today, there are demands on virtually all of NOAA programs to provide information on the health of the environment in real-time.  The CLASS Program is NOAA s major initiative to re-engineer, modernize, and enhance the current suite of national environmental data storage and access services to better serve the current and future environmental data and information needs of the United States.

Two contractors currently provide IT support to CLASS:  Global Science & Technology, Inc. (formerly TMC Technologies Inc., 2110 Pleasant Valley Road, Fairmont, WV  16554-8554), 7855 Walker Drive Suite 200, Greenbelt, MD  20770-3239; and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), 15245 Shady Grove Road, Suite 200, Rockville, MD  20850-3222.

4.  PRESOLICITATION NOTICE INFORMATION

<DESC>8(a) SET ASIDE: In accordance with FAR 19.803, the Contracting Officer intends to restrict this acquisition to 8(a) sources.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: The Census Bureau Disability Program Office?s (DPO) mission is to increase accessibility of existing Census Bureau facilities, provide training opportunities on disability related topics, increase the accessibility of information technology, remove barriers to the employment and advancement of persons of all abilities, and improve communication within the disability community, internally and externally.   DPO anticipates that Census Bureau deaf and hard of hearing employees would require real-time captioning services during Census Bureau functions on an occasional basis.   

The Contractor shall provide real-time captioning services for Deaf and Hard of Hearing communication needs of Census Bureau employees, visitors, and applicants.  These services shall include:
 
* Provide real time captioning services for formal and informal meetings, classroom training, seminars, conferences, ceremonies, and luncheons at all Census Bureau locations, primarily in Suitland, Maryland, and other offsite locations in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.
* Work assignments that may be highly technical in nature, such as: demographic and economic statistics, census survey terminology, and government acronyms.
* Work jointly with Census Bureau staff or contract sign language interpreters. 
* Capability to interface with Census Bureau VBI Caption/Data Processor Encoder/Decoder (Model PDR-885) and EEG Encoder/Decoder to provide real-time captioning services on a television or large screen in Census Bureau auditorium.
* Provide accessibility services at all scheduled events regardless if there is an actual need. (Census Bureau policies require that real-time captioning services be provided at events that are open to all employees, regardless if a member of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community is present.)
* Capability to receive and coordinate requests for services.

The government anticipates that the services will be provided through a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). 

The award of this BPA is subject to the availability of funds.

Request companies interested in this project, and who qualify as an 8(a) contractor under NAICS Code 561492 or similar code, email their company background, previous experience in providing real time captioning to deaf/hard of hearing clients, and confirmation of 8(a)small business certification to Mr. Paul Boesch at the below email address.
This is not a request for proposal.

<DESC>This synopsis is published pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.205 (c), and is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. NOTE: There is no additional information available for release at this time. Verbal request for information will not be provided. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, SSES is seeking information regarding the potential use of commercially available or conceptual air filtration technology suitable for use in gas turbine engine intake separator systems aboard either current or potential future amphibious air cushion vehicle. Desirable attributes of filtration technology considered for naval applications include: high filtration efficiency (across the engine power range/associated air flow velocity); low pressure drop; compact/low volume requirement; light weight; high reliability and low maintenance requirements; low life cycle cost. The operating environment!   is that of an amphibious air cushion vehicle in a salt and particulate laden atmosphere, thereby necessitating an intake separator system to separate bulk water, salt and particulates from the intake air flow. This is not a solicitation/RFP and there are no known future requirements pending at this time. Any information (physical and performance characteristics, illustrations/drawings, commercial applications, operating experience, development/production status, space and weight requirements, discussion on suitability for use in naval applications, approximate cost and availability, etc.) submitted relative to this request for information should be forwarded to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, SSES, 5001 S.

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION:

Document Type:	Sources Sought
Identifier:		Milstar Air Force Command Post Terminal (AFCPT) software engineering support
Posted Date:		26 Sep 2006
Due Date:		25 Oct 2006

PURPOSE:

Contractors are being sought that are capable of providing engineering support and technical expertise relating to the design, development, manufacture, test, and documentation of the AFCPT.   The AFCPT was developed in the 1980s and has evolved with the Milstar system.  The AFCPT is currently in and is supported by a government team of engineers and programmers.  The engineering support and technical expertise is being sought to mitigate the risk of future problems causing a catastrophic lost of communications.      

The engineering services will have a period of performance is not to exceed 5 years.  The services will be performed at Peterson AFB, CO and the contractors site.

This is not a request for proposal or solicitation, or an indication that the government will contract for this requirement.  The government will not pay for information received in response to this inquiry and is in no way obligated by the information received.

DESCRIPTION:

The AFCPT software was developed to meet communication protocol requirements identified in SI-1135 (Milstar Low Data Rate Payload to Terminal Interface Control Document (ICD)) and the SR-2300 (Terminal Segment Specification for the Milstar II Satellite Communication Program).  Through the implementation of these protocols the AFCPT provides secure communication for both strategic and tactical users which is protected, jam resistant and survivable. 
Most of the software is FORTRAN and C based and consists of six Computer Program Configured Items (CPCIs). 

?	CPCI-1 Real Time Operating System
?	VxWorks by Wind River
?	CPCI-2 Terminal Control Processing Software (TCPSW)
?	Terminal Access Controller (TAC)
?	Base Band Processor (BBP)
?	CPCI-3 Terminal Test Set Software (TSTSW)
?	Simulation
?	Support utilities
?	CPCI-4 Commerical Off The Shelf (COTS) Support Software
?	Microsoft, Wind River, Rational, Greenhills, Digital
?	CPCI-6 Time Distribution SubSystem Pre-Processor (TDSPP)
?	Time Standard Module Database
?	CPCI-7 TDSPP COTS Support Software
?	Microsoft Access, ADA, and Crosstalk current system
?	Updating to Red Hat Linux, and MySQL


REQUIREMENTS:

Sustainment of the AFCPT software requires an understanding of current software requirements as documented in the Computer Program Development Specifications for the CPCI 2, 3 and 6 above and how they should change to correct AFCPT deficiencies.  Once requirement changes are established, the current design is changed and documented.  The changed design is then implemented in the code.  After the code is changed unit test, integration test, formal qualification test and prime item test are performed.  Contractors interested in providing the AFCPT software engineering support must demonstrate the ability to accomplish the above tasks with respect to the AFCPT by documenting experience in this area.  An understanding and an effort to comply with the Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI) is also desired.  




QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

Submit all questions to the contract negotiator, Ruth Silvester, email:  ruth.silvester@hill.af.mil

<DESC>Description

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is requesting information to determine the availability of interested parties to provide and operate an MRI and multimodality imaging facility for small rodent species in support for the NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP).

The Offeror shall provide support to:
1.  Operate a Government-furnished 7 Tesla MRI system which consists of a 210 mm bore Magnex Scientific superconducting magnet with shielded gradients, a GE Medical Systems EXCITE console, and RF subsystems specific for imaging small laboratory rodent species. 

2. Maintain and extend the capability of this system as required by the NIEHS for extended capabilities such as increased spatial resolution, specific tissue contrast, and high specimen throughput.

3.  Perform MR imaging of rodent tissue specimens at a spatial resolution that is more than 300,000X greater than that routinely used on clinical imaging systems. The field of view for imaging may be directed at observations of the whole animal (e.g. mouse embryos or fetuses) and specific functional systems and /or organs (e.g. mouse brains, heart, lungs). This will entail; a.) The use of specialized tissue preparation methods for specimen fixation (use of alternate contrast agents, perfusion fixation), b.) Manufacture of specialized radiofrequency coils, and c.) Integration of unique image acquisition strategies and novel reconstruction methods to allow rapid acquisition (acquisition times of < 3 hrs) of very large high-quality image arrays (> 4 GB/image) with isotropic 3D spatial resolution < 25 microns. Tissue specimens shall be prepared in a manner that would permit subsequent evaluation of tissues by conventional histology following imaging.  Additional modalities for imaging small laboratory rodents such as micro-CT, ultra sound, molecular imaging and other specialized optical modalities may be required. The Contractor shall develop and operate such systems as appropriate for small animal (rodent) imaging in support of NIEHS studies.

4.  Perform longitudinal (in vivo) imaging studies in which the same animal(s) is/are imaged at multiple times to observe the time course and response (temporal pathogenesis and/or recovery) and pathology (development of anatomic features such as tumor growth) associated with exposure to xenobiotics.  Such studies shall require the use of specialized equipment and procedures for animal support structures and anesthesia to minimize motion, careful control of body temperature, and radiofrequency coils adapted to the very high magnetic field environment. 

5.  Provide and/or use a government furnished web-accessible digital electronic system for managing the access, review, downloading, and the archive of digital image data files and collateral documents pertaining to scientific imaging studies. The system must have the capacity to handle an exceptionally broad range of digitized imagery including conventional histology, very large 3D image arrays generated in MR histology, microCT, microPET, power point presentations, scanned images and other imagery, data, and collateral documentation. This scientific imaging management system must include the capability of enabling any user at NIEHS to access the images, data sets, and collateral documents from multiple sites with commonly used personal computers and modes of Internet access. 

6.  Provide expertise/advice concerning rodent magnetic resonance image acquisition strategy, MRI image quality, and its biological and/or scientific significance.  Participate in interpretation of the generated images and/or provide training in sample preparation and/or image interpretation for NIEHS investigators.

7.  The contractor shall maintain compliance with Federal, State and Local laws, and NIH regulations such as the following: 1) The Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-544 as amended in 1970, 1976, and 1985) http://www.nal.usda.gov; 2) Standard Operating Procedures for Laboratory Animal Management that conform to the most recent versions of PHS and other public guidance. 3) NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW); 4) Association For Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC); 5) NIEHS Laboratory Health and Safety Minimum Requirement for Contractors; 6) “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (NRC, 1996); 7) FDA “Good Laboratory Practices for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies” (CFR 21 Part 85).

MANDATORY QUALIFICATIONS: The following mandatory qualification criteria must be met at the time of award:  1) the contractor shall provide an imaging facility, equipment except for magnet and APPROPRIATE staff dedicated exclusively to support of NIEHS/NTP studies; 2) the facility shall be located within a 30 to 45 minute driving time of the NIEHS main campus, 111 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709; 3) the facility shall be accessible to NIEHS/NTP scientists; 4) all components of the Imaging Facility and the support areas including offices, and laboratories and a facility for temporary housing of small laboratory rodents in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (PL89-544) shall be located on one site.m

For estimating purposes the Government estimates the level-of effort at 15760 direct labor hours per year as follows:  Professional – 4920 direct labor hours; Technical - 9840 direct labor hours; Administrative Support - 1000 direct labor hours.

2.	Perform Single log-out within the trusted domain
3.	Automate the federated identity information within a single domain (i.e. all of USJFCOM)

?	The Vendor is expected to demonstrate these capabilities in the upcoming CWID demonstration of June 2007. CWID, the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration, is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff annual event that enables U.S. Combatant Commands and the international community to investigate new and emerging technologies that can be moved into operational use within 6-12 months following the execution period. The demonstration builds a temporary global network over which cutting edge communications technologies interact to support scripted scenario. Technologies are evaluated for utility, interoperability with existing and new systems, and security.
 
?	The FIM will support critical government functions and will be immune from malicious service and/or functional disruptions to which the shared public networks are vulnerable (i.e., so-called cyber attacks).  

?	FIM will provide the highest levels of reliability and availability including trunk and access diversity, and rapid failover in the event of server disruptions.  This RFI does not specify a particular requirement for availability or reliability.  Responses to this RFI will assist in establishing this requirement.  In formulating responses, each respondent should describe the reliability and availability characteristics of each alternative included in their response.  

?	The solution will be secure (i.e., encrypted by the network using NSA approved encryption techniques), and will be suitable for carrying classified information.  For purposes of this RFI respondents should assume encryption of payload data only.  No encryption of routing or addressing information is contemplated at this time.

?	This will be a turnkey solution offered and priced as a service to participating users.  For purposes of this RFI, assume a single invoice with supporting detail presented monthly to GSA will be acceptable.

?	All components and links must be located in the U.S.

?	The FIM solution shall evolve to maintain technology and service currency with state of the art commercial services to the maximum extent practical.

?	FIMS will be operated on a 24/7 basis by the contractor.

?	FIMS will provide initial operational capabilities (IOC) within six months from contract award.  For purposes of responding to the RFI, IOC is defined as full functionality of authentication services for the DoD Common Access Card. Within 12 months after award, remaining authentication modules involving Kerberos and X509 certificates will also be part of the solution.

Other requirements not directly related to physical network and services isolation will be addressed at a later date.  Examples of such requirements include security policies and security management requirements, required active defense measures, security of network management and control technologies, network capacities, service level agreements, and other important considerations.  

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.

4.0	POSSIBLE NETWORK SOLUTION

The FIM software must meet the functional requirements specified above.  The Government is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  The Government encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.  

This RFI seeks information about a fully dedicated federated solution as well as other approaches that could meet the functional requirements with additional levels of sharing of personnel, equipment, and connectivity paths.  In doing so, the Government seeks to understand the tradeoffs among risks, costs (initial and ongoing) and alternative technical architectures that incorporate increasing degrees of sharing.  

Accordingly, respondents are encouraged to provide information about any alternatives that can be demonstrated to be immune from the kinds of disruptions described in section 3.0, above.

5.0	SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit. 

Section 1 ? Conceptual Alternatives 

Briefly describe two or more alternative architecture concepts for FIM, including the reliability and availability characteristics of the alternatives.  Discuss the capability for the architecture to expand to meet video requirements, and to meet needs outside CONUS.  (3-5 pages per alternative with one diagram per alternative identifying the brand/type of solution that would typically be deployed)

Section 2 ? Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks of penetration.  (1 page per alternative)

Section 3 ? Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost estimates for each alternative for 5 and 10-year contract terms for non-recurring and annual recurring costs using the locations provided at the public information exchange meeting (one page table).  Also, discuss cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations (2-3 pages)

Section 4 ? Corporate Expertise

Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.  (No suggested page count)

In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, security requirements, security assurance processes, and any relevant lessons learned (1-2 pages per project).  

Include any comments on the structure of the requirements for a formal RFP response.

Note ? please also describe any network capacity assets that you might be willing to dedicate for deploying FIM.  Examples of such assets might include unsold or unsubscribed capacities, so-called dark fiber routes, assets designated for liquidation or that are financially under-performing, etc.  

Section 5 ? Additional Materials

Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Notice of Intent to Award
<DESC>This is Notice of Intent to Award for commercial supply items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This is a notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole-source order with ADA Technologies, Inc, 8100 Shaffer Parkway, Suite 130, Littleton, CO 80127 for the purchase of ADA Technology integrated ceilometer weatherpod systems. This agency intends to issue a purchase orderunder the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE OR BRAND:  The requested system is a hand emplaced environmental sensing system designed specifically for SOF forces to clandestinely report and relay critical meteorological conditions in data sparse, semi-permissive, or denied areas. The sensor equipment is designed and manufactured by ADA Technology, Littleton, Colorado. The ADA Technology Satellite Weather Station System consisting of the Satellite Weather Pod, the Satellite Communications Pod, and the Ceilometer is a lightweight meteorological data collection system capable of collecting critical go/no-go criteria essential for rotary and fixed-wing SOF operations. The ADA Technology ceilometer employs the only Air Force Laser Safety Board approved laser constructed from the Liecha IV hand-held, eye-safe laser range finder enabling the ADA Technology to safely procure critical ceiling height information. ADA Technology is the only company that currently provides a integrated ceilometer in the system package.  The organic solar panels make this sensor self-sustaining, and the lightweight and compact nature of the sensor (lkilogram and 6 inches in diameter) is essential for recovery and rapid relocation to facilitate the requirements of SOF forces.  The internal GPS organic to each component is crucial for sensor emplacement and recovery given the frequent rotation of forces and the clandestine nature of the sensor. The internal 900 MHz radio modem can be employed for multi-mile bi-directional communications with a PC in the field or to an optional Satellite Communications Pod (SCP) for long-haul communications to/from any location in the world facilitating the near real-time dissemination of mission-essential meteorological data.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of intent to award sole source.
<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to Motorola, Inc, located at 7031 Columbia Gateway Drive 3RD Floor, Columbia, MD 21046-2289.  The award will be made for the purchase of two (2) Motorola P2066 repeaters. This procurement is bein g conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(2) (ii), for Other than Full and Open Competition in the case of a follow-on contract and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The TNARNG has already purchased three (3) Motorol a portable Astro Digital XTS5000 764 radios, twenty (20) Motorola portable Astro Digital XTS5000 136 radios and six (6) Motorola XTL 5000 VHF Mobile 10-50 Watt 136 radios. The two (2) Motorola P2066 repeaters are the only known products capable of integrat ing with these radios to maximize their output capability. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to USPFO for Tennessee Contracting Division Attn: Randal Halbrooks, PO Box 41502 Nashville, or sent by email to randal.halbrooks@ng.army.mil . Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted. Responses to this notice shall be received no later than 11:00 AM Central Daylight Time (CST), Thursday, September 28, 2006. A determi nation not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.  The point of contact for this announcement is Randal Halbrooks, Contract Specialist, at randal.halbrooks@ng.army.mil. The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase.  1.	This request for justification for other than full and open competition is for two (2) Motorola P2066 repeaters, requested by the Directorate of Logistics (JFHQ-TN-J4), Tennessee Army National Guard (TNARNG). 2.	The TNARNG has purchased three (3) Motorola portable Astro Digital XTS5000 764 radios, twenty (20) Motorola portable Astro Digital XTS5000 136 radios and six (6) Motorola XTL 5000 VHF Mobile 10-50 Watt 136 radios. The XTS 5000 radio is the only radio th at will provide the critical interoperability between the TNARNG, local and state law enforcement agencies as well as the emergency relief directors.   The XTS 5000 is currently used by two other TNARNG units (45th CST and VTS), as well as used by the agen cies we will need to communicate with during emergency operations.  The Motorola P2066 repeaters are required to integrate with these radios to maximize their output capability.                          3.	The total estimated value of these repeaters is. 4.	Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1(2) (ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for a follow-on contract.  5.	The TNARNG is the states second line of defense in time of disaster.  It is imperative the guard can effectively communicate with all responders and relief agencies with out delay in time of crises.  In the past deployments the guard leadership was hind ered by the lack of communication creating a delay in response time as well as information flow.  This lag time can be linked to safety issues and human suffering.  The XTS 5000 base station with portable radios can be deployed to any area of operation wit hin the Continental United States or overseas making this a Federal and State mission essential asset.      1.	Efforts to identify other contractors for this requirement have been made by publicizing a notice of intent to award sole source to Motorola via www.fedbizopps.gov/. 2.	The anticipated cost of the items offered for this acquisition are determined to be fair and reasonable by comparison of the vendors proposed prices to those prices listed on their commercial price list. 3.	No other efforts  have not been made to identify other sources of competition have not been made as the Motorola brand of equipment is the only known source capable of providing communication ability with all of the other agencies the TNARNG is required to communicate with . 4.	There are no other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. 5.	No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition. 6.	No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken, as the Motorola brand radio is the only known radio capable of satisfying this agencys requirement. 7.	This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements at the designated location, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.A/OEM/DCP has identified the Mitsubishi 9800 UPS as the essential key component to improve the current UPS infrastructure at the designated location. Equipment listed above is required to improve and update the current power capabilities to existing Department of State’s power situation at A/OEM/DCP’s Test and Training Facility.  This unit provides a variety of intelligent features including large power capabilities, high speed switching and low control power consumption.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key power component of the incumbent UPS system. The Mitsubishi 9800 UPS system provides advanced PWM technology with advanced switching application; provides energy saving and clean power supply environment; provides superior input and output performance; and provides a unique optimum control and high reliability technology.

For purposes of standardizing the infrastructure components of the HR system it is necessary for this equipment to be the Dell brand name. Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment. The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. Utilizing Dell for these additional enterprise products and services will provide continuity and single point of contact responsibility for the overall infrastructure.  Having Dell as the single vendor for the entire enterprise mix of servers and storage products, including software, provides a clear escalation path and resolution of all issues to maintain critical systems.This action is taken in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as identified by FAR 6.302-1. For purposes of standardizing the infrastructure components of the HR system it is necessary for this equipment to be the Dell brand name. •	Dell provides common images and components with its servers platforms — helping to simplify management and cut costs. Dell has spent the last decade building commonality into the server family with the specific goal of simplifying management and maintenance, while reducing cost and complexity.  •	ImageWatch™ — Dell provides a road map of upcoming software changes, allowing HR to better plan updates.  •	Block updates — By delivering scheduled changes, Dell can help minimize the number of updates HR makes each year.  •	Image commonality — By reducing the number of overall images in the Dell PowerEdge server line, Dell has reduced the time required for image maintenance.  •	Component commonality — The Dell PowerEdge Server Family share common components (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), which help improve efficiency during build and servicing.  •	Management commonality — Dell PowerEdge Servers are managed through a common interface to help maximize efficiency and streamline management. Dell OpenManage is provided with ALL Dell systems at no extra cost. OpenManage provides one management interface for hardware, software, and operating systems.  •	Dell tracks configurations of every product down to the component level, which allows Dell to quickly and easily analyze product performance and take corrective action when needed.  •	Dell provides investment protection when migrating to future Blade Server architectures (ie, going from PowerEdge 1855 to PowerEdge 1955).  •	Dell advocates use of industry-standard resource management software where competitors are proprietary (customer lock-in) and expensive.  •	Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment. The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. Utilizing Dell for these additional enterprise products and services will provide continuity and single point of contact responsibility for the overall infrastructure.  •	Having Dell as the single vendor for the entire enterprise mix of servers and storage products, including software, provides a clear escalation path and resolution of all issues to maintain critical systems.  •	Dell Systems Management provides a single tool to manage and monitor the entire enterprise of servers and storage products.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the SpectraLogic Spectra T-950 Tape Library.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST requires the SpectraLogic Spectra T-950 Tape Library.   CA currently runs the Spectra T-950 tape library at its primary site in Beltsville.  This purchase will allow CA to form the redundant site at the Harry S Truman Building (Main State).  Because CA requires the movement of tapes between the two sites for disaster recovery purposes, the redundant site must exactly match the primary site.  For compatibility purposes, the Spectra T-950 will best meet CA’s needs.   Also, the continued use of the SpectraLogic Spectra T-950, rather than to introduce another manufacturer’s product, is cost effective.  The use of one make and model eliminates the need to purchase, maintain and account for inventories of spare parts, cables, and drives for multiple tape library types    In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested SpectraLogic Spectra T-950 Tape Library without delay.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the SpectraLogic Spectra T-950 Tape Library because results obtain by the Bureau’s Data Engineering Task Team in evaluations and reviews of other manufacturers’ tape libraries indicated that this tape library most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The Quantum DX100 tape library and PX510 tape library will together create a backup solution that will meet the needs of CA/CST/DO.  The equipment will allow for nightly mailbox level backups and multiple Exchange backups during the day, minimizing the risk of lost mail.  The solutions will also allow for faster restores as writing from disk has been tested to be five to ten times faster than from tape.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST requires the Quantum DX100 and PX510 Tape Library.  Currently, CA’s backups are managed using a combination of Netbackup 4.0 and the Quantum P 3000.  The P3000 has reached the end of its supported life and is beginning to experience failures that jeopardize the ability to adequately backup and restore mission critical data.  In addition, the SDLT tape technology of the former backup system is now becoming obsolete.  The new solution with combine disk and tape based technologies to provide a faster backup and recovery, site redundancy, scalability and lower operational cost.     This purchase will allow CA to implement a new backup solution to replace the current failing one while still allowing CA to still utilize the existing tapes.  CA/CST has selected the Quantum DX100 and PX510 Backup Solution because results obtain by the Bureau’s Domestic Operations Infrastructure Support Services team in evaluations and reviews of other manufacturers’ tape libraries indicated that this tape library most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Quantum DX100 and PX510 Backup Solution without delay.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. SELLERS MUST BID WITH SPECS AND CONFIGURATION OF LINE ITEM 001 & 002 AS OUTLINED IN ATTACHED XL SPREADSHEET. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server have been identified as key components of the Department’s networking system, with optimal server configurations to meet CA/CST/VCS’ Diversity Immigrant Visa Information System (DVIS) project’s needs.  Currently CA is upgrading the OS and Oracle in preparation for the next releases of DVIS 05.03.00; therefore, this is an opportune time to refresh the DVIS server environments with the new servers.  The HP ML570 G3 meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: ·	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health. ·	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks. ·	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives. ·	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers. ·	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) ·	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting. ·	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives. ·	Systems must have front video/USB ports. ·	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources. ·	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A)	Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via HP authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full  HP warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.

CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of Dell PowerEdge 6850 Servers and Dell PowerEdge 2950 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements and the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ systems environment and visa generation requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another manufacturer or company. CA/CST has identified the Dell PowerEdge 6850 Servers and Dell PowerEdge 2950 Servers as the optimal high-end platform to meet the needs of the Harry S Truman Building (Main State) redundant site.  CA is currently running Dell Servers at its primary site in Beltsville; this purchase will allow CA to create a redundant site at Main State.  In order to maintain compatibility between primary site and the redundant site, CA requires the same hardware configuration at each location. The purchase of these Dell servers will ensure compatibility and will best meet CA’s needs. The Dell PowerEdge servers w/dual core Intel Xenon processor were judged to offer the most power and redundancy of any server of its class, and was determined to be best suited to support the redundant site. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements.The Dell server equipment was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureau’s Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which, in the interests of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration, has established an environment comprised solely of Dell HW.  The continued use of Dell servers obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple HW manufacturer’s server configurations or to manage multiple vendor’s out years support and maintenance agreements.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of a F5 Big IP load balancer device.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company The F5 Networks Big IP is hardware that provides high-availability load balancing, fast and extremely intelligent layer 7 switching, granular interactive control, DoS protection, resource pooling and a number of other features to help protect our Internet presence with  the following features: •	Reliability - Delivers the industry's most proven and advanced system to ensure that applications are always available.  •	Accelerated Applications - Provides control to accelerate application performance by up to 3-times, ensures that priority applications are served first, and offloads expensive server cycles.   •	Reduced Server and Bandwidth Costs - Triples server capacity through a set of infrastructure optimization capabilities; reduces bandwidth costs by up to 80% through intelligent HTTP compression, bandwidth management and more.  •	Greater Network and Application Security - From DoS protection to cloaking to filtering out application attacks, BIG-IP adds critical security features that cannot be addressed elsewhere in the network.  •	Application Intelligence and Control - The industry's only solution which delivers complete application fluency - enabling network-speed full payload inspection and programmable event-based traffic management to understand and act upon application flows.  •	Total Integration for All IP Applications -- Provides a comprehensive solution that can integrate with all applications, not just Web based protocols.  Provides organizations with a centralized solution for all IP applications, including legacy and emerging applications like VOIP -- all in a single unified system.  •	Industry Leading Performance - Delivers the fastest traffic management solution to secure, deliver and optimize application performance. Offers best-in-market SSL TPS, bulk encryption, and the highest concurrent SSL connections available today. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The F5 1500 BigIP load balancers are required to replace units that were moved to the KCC to become the new production farm load balancers.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Headquarters Procurement Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Olive Security Training Center, 2701 US Hwy 51N, Nesbit, MS 38651-7719 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The reason justifying the lack of competition is that Olive Security Training Center is the only company that can provide all of the required training services to support USSOCOMs needs at one facility and within USSOCOMs tight schedule.  The increasing threat from the Global War on Terror (GWOT) has demanded an increase of skill sets required.  Units require training for combat driving, personnel security, and Close Quarter Combat (CQC).  These skills are critical in the preparation for executing Personnel Security Detail assignments in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM.  The desired course of instruction utilizes a creative mixture of training scenarios which meets current real world threats.  The training/instruction required includes the following:  advanced firearms (pistol and carbine) training, vehicle assault and defense, Close Quarters Combat (CQC) training, Personal Security Detail (PSD) driving instruction, urban combat skills, on and off road driving skills, and long range sniper operations.  The vendor must be able to provide the following equipment/facilities:  classrooms, shooting range, fabricated structures, static and moving target systems, CQC breaching targets, two-mile live fire track facility, PSD sedans and SUVs, disposal and target vehicles, driver safety equipment, six-mile off road track with obstacles, and daily EMS coverage.  The USSOCOM has units scheduled for deployment and due to the numerous mission sets that these units must master prior to an operational deployment, their training schedule has been maximized with little flexibility in schedule.  Consequently, the training must commence in October 2006 and not exceed three weeks in length.  In addition to schedule concerns, the required training should be conducted by one company at one facility to ensure greater consistency in training and to allow for a final test of integrated scenarios.  Olive Security Training Center is the only company that can meet these requirements.  Based on market research, other companies can only provide a portion of the training.  It is anticipated that the contract type shall be a three-week Firm Fixed Price contract for an estimated $288,000.  See Note 22 for any responses to this announcement.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via email to Contract Specialist William Hilliard (william.hilliard@socom.mil or 813-282-8795 ext.6107) or Contracting Officer Karene Spurlin (spurlik@socom.mil phone or 813-282-8795 ext.6105).

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Department is moving in the direction of using frequent, local, disk-based snapshots for quick recovery of lost or damaged files or e-mails, which will reduce the need for off-site transport of backups for disaster recovery purposes (as required in 12 FAM 622.3).  The price of tape drives as now deployed by GITM for this purpose , and GITM deploys one drive for each of three servers plus a spare,  plus the cost of media.  Removable hard drives, on the other hand, consist of a carrier  and a removable drive.  In the recommended model of making weekly off-site backups (not daily), this reduces the cost significantly, while also greatly improving post's ability to quickly recover files and e-mails from the on-site snapshots. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Tandberg RDX Removable Hard Drive system as the only one available in the market today that meets the Department's requirements for low cost, capacity, performance, and ease of use in the backup model described in (2) above.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s enterprise backup system.

<DESC>The following are answers to prospective offerors:

Q1. Pertaining to the fenders:  Most of the fenders that are presently installed have suitable swivels that are working.  There are some that are installed that will need attention.  Most of the fenders that are on shore and out of the water have swivels that are missing and or broken or corroded.  The internal torsion member between the two swivels is also missing or broken on most of the fenders out of the water. Do fenders have to be restored to the manufacturer's specifications?  According to the manufacturer's representative, without the torsion member installed the fender will flatten out if pressed hard enough

Answer : KTR will not install the fenders with missing swivel nor will the KTR procure swivels to repair/replace missing ones. Government will provide the fender body along with the necessary hardware attachments affixed to the body up to the swivels. Prospective bidders shall concentrate on the repair of hardwares connected from the wharf (concrete bulkhead) to the shackles connecting to the swivels. 

Q2. Pertaining to the docks:  The given dimensions are 14? x 20?.
How much weight should the docks be able to support?  Do you plan on keeping any marine equipment stored on the docks?

Answer: UFC 4-152-07N Design: Small Craft Berthing Facilities which was referenced in the SOW provides the design and construction criteria for small craft berthing.
