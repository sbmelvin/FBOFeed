<CONTACT>Vivian Truman 850-230-7230 , or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida (NSWC PC), intends to award a sole-source cost plus fixed fee contract to Advanced Acoustic Concepts, Inc. (AAC), Texas Division, Corpus Christi, TX for continued development of an Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) / Underwater Mine Countermeasures contact recognition training system using the same technology developed for the SNIUTT project. The initial capability for this training system was developed under contract N61331-04-C-0006. This effort continues that development to incorporate the following features and capabilities: Refinement of an AMCM mine-like contact recognition training system for the AN/AQS-20A system; Initial development of a mine-like contact recognition training system for the family of autonomous underwater vehicles known as the Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) used as an organic minehunting capability; and maintenance of existing SNIUTT based training. This acquisition is un!  suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. This effort builds directly on unique technologies, algorithms, and software developed by AAC in developing highly sophisticated embedded anti-submarine warfare sonar training systems under the Surface Navy Integrated Undersea Tactical Technology (SNIUTT) project. AAC was the originator of and developed the initial concept of SNIUTT.  In the initial phase of the project AAC developed the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Surface Undersea Warfare Combat System On Board Trainer, and the Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center analysis and tactical trainer. These trainers are used to provide realistic operator training as well as test complex system team trainers. SNIUTT is eventually intended to provide a more accurate picture of water and area conditions to warfare commanders in the theater. Development of the training technology is the initial step towards this goal. Funding for the continuation of the MIW contact recognition!   training system project was a Congressional add for the Fiscal Year ( FY) 2007 Appropriations Act and the language in the law specifically designates the funding for the SNIUTT project originated by AAC. This effort is a direct follow-on to contract N61331-04-C-0006 for services to continue development of a highly specialized capability.  Use of any other source would result in a duplication of cost in the amount of the funds expended under contract N61331-04-C-0006. As the originator of the SNIUTT concept and the developer of the unique technologies, algorithms, and software used in the initial trainers under the project, AAC is the only source with the prerequisite experience, knowledge, and expertise required to successfully perform this requirement.  NAICS Code 541511 applies.  FSC AD24 Note 22 applies.  Contract Specialist: Vivian Truman, Code XPS1, NSWC Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  This technology entitled ?Conformational Real-Time Atmospheric and Environmental Characterization Apparatus and Method (Battelle IPID No. 14351-E)? is an apparatus and method for introducing gas samples into a mass spectrometer or other analytical device.  Through a sample manifold comprised of adjustable valves, the flow of gas from a sample can be fully conformed to the pressure conditions of the mass spectrometer or other analytical device.  Thus, gas samples can be directly introduced into the device for analysis.  The manifold is particularly useful for sampling from oxygen-rich environments, such as room or outdoor air, but can also be adjusted for direct sampling from oxygen-deficient environments, such as microbial samples.  	Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 20 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Low Background Infrared (LBIR) Facility is responsible for the dissemination of infrared calibrations in low temperature background environments over the 2 micrometer to 30 micrometer wavelength range. 

The LBIR facility is currently working to develop a standard radiometer that is capable of calibrating infrared radiative powers from 10 nW to 1 picowatt to an uncertainty of less than 0.1 percent of the measured signal.  In addition, the detector needs to have a long wavelength cut-off limit of 32 micrometers that matches that of transfer radiometers that are currently in use or will be in the near future. 

To achieve this goal the LBIR facility is procuring discrete detectors that must be arranged in a trapping configuration such that surface reflections from one discrete detector would land on the active area of another discrete detector until more than 99.99 percent of the incident radiation has been absorbed.

This requirement is for discrete detectors that will be used to create the trap detector.   The requirement is for the delivery of approximately 50 packaged discrete detectors, and the delivery of approximately 200 other discrete detectors that have not been packaged. The final numbers of delivered discrete detectors will be most likely change depending on the optical properties of samples measured during the discrete detector fabrication process.

Delivery terms shall be FOB DESTINATION.  The period of performance shall be 18 months from the date of award.  

This requirement is being procured using full & open competition.  The requirements of FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, shall govern the process.
 
The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), specifications, RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-07-RP-0010.

The RFP is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about March 30, 2007, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District, Portland, Oregon (COE) is conducting a market survey on the availability of potential contractors to provide acoustic micro-transmitters intended for implantation into yearling and sub-yearling Chi nook salmon.  The COE has developed and demonstrated a juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous and networked acoustic receivers (nodes) that meet its needs for evaluating the surviva l of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Hydropower System.  The COE intends to award a multiple year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), contract for JSATS micro-transmitters in 2007.  Prior to issuing a solicitation the COE will conduct a workshop for interested parties to preview the current and future uses of this tool and to preview the specifications of the JSATS micro-acoustic transmitter.  The workshop will be conducted in Portlan d, Oregon on Wednesday, 04 April, 2007.  The solicitation will be available on or about 06 April, 2007 with proposals due on or about 29 June, 2007. This procurement action will be conducted in two phases, an evaluation phase and a production phase. In order to be eligible for award, and as part of the evaluation criteria of the solicitation, the Contractor must demonstrate that the acoustic tags meet functional and design specifications for size, shape, performance, quality assurance and bio-compatibility.  Included in the evaluation of firms will be their history for on-schedule delivery of large quantities of high quality telemetry devices. Evaluatio n and rating factors will be included in the solicitation when issued.   If an offerors Technical proposal meets the criteria as established in the Evaluation factors, and the offerors price is determined fair & reasonable, the offer will culminate in an award, for the evaluation phase.  It is the Governments intent to award several contracts to qualified firms.  The evaluation phase will consist of preparation of fully functional tag prototypes which will be evaluated for performance at an independent  testing facility.  Companies producing prototypes that meet or exceed functional specifications and perform successfully in the evaluation phase will be selected to enter the production phase of the contract based on a per unit cost.   Companies selected to produce prototype JSATS transmitters will be notified on or around 13 July, 2007 with prototypes being due for testing no later than 31 August, 2007.  Selection of a final contractor or contractors for the production phase of this con tract shall be made in October, 2007.   The contract period will be approximately 1 year and will include additional option years.

The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.

<DESC>UPDATE: The RFP for this acquisition has been updated per discussions held with industry during the 8 Mar 07 Pre-Proposal Conference.  The meeting slides, RFP documents and attachments, and a summation of the amendments have been posted on the bidder's library under Bidders-OCX at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.

       (a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
       (b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
The Executive Office for United States of Attorney?s (EOUSA) on behalf of the United States Attorney?s Office Southern District of Texas (Corpus Christi) invites contractors to submit a proposal for services described in the attached statement of work, under the authority of Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Enclosed you will find a Statement of Work for Grand Jury and Deposition Court Reporting Services.  Please submit your price and technical proposal FOR GRAND JURY AND/OR DEPOSITIONS by March 19, 2007 at 11:00 a.m. (EST).  This RFP in no way obligates the U.S. Government to award a contract, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in preparing and submitting your proposal. 

The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on key personnel, organizational past performance, organizational experience, and price.  Under a Best Value source selection, non-price evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.   EOUSA intends to make multiple awards under this solicitation.  The Proposals shall include the following information:

(1) Provide resumes of prospective personnel. The personnel will be the person expected to perform the tasks identified in the Scope of Work. The resume should reflect the personnel?s security clearance level, training and certifications, if any.

(2) Provide up to three (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, up to three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The Government reserves the right to check other references not provided by the Contractor.  The following information is required for each reference:
		
			(A)  Customer name and address
		(B)  Point of contact (name, telephone number) for contractual/administrative matters and technical performance.
			(C)  Period of contract performance
			(D)  Description of work performed
	
(3)  A summary of the Contractor?s experience demonstrating the contractor?s knowledge and ability to perform the duties and tasks reflected in the Scope of Work. This summary shall not exceed two (2) pages.
	
(4)  Price quote as reflected in Section B.

This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set Aside.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 561492.  In order to be considered a small business under this NAICS code, your average annual receipts must not exceed $6.5 million.  

The Government estimated value of this contract is $235,000.00 for one base year and four 12 month option years.  The precise period of performance will be determined at the time of award.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the 3M-AIT Passport Reader.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the 3M-AIT Passport Readers to support Consular posts overseas.  3M-AIT Passport Readers have been deployed in all Consular Systems Modernization installations since the inception of the program. Additional units are primarily required at this time to replace any existing AIT PAX readers in need of maintenance, thus extending the life of the VISA Quality Assurance procedure.  The reader was initially selected because the travel document production systems with which it is used required an accurate, reliable instrument to perform quality assurance checks on the OCR zones of visas and passports, thereby validating their machine readability. The reader enables Consulates to generate travel documents that will be accepted and accurately interpreted at any port of entry employing mechanized processing systems. This is of great importance since it eliminates or minimizes incidences of false interpretations of bearer identification data.  Such mis-reads can result in the refusal of entry or passage to qualified bearers, impede the processing flows at ports of entry, and otherwise embarrass the U.S. Government.  The AIT reader was selected following a very lengthy market survey and evaluation process.  It was found to be the only device of its type able to meet the Bureaus specifications.  Features of the unit evaluated are as follows: 	Reads International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and non-ICAO compliant documents 	Performs quality assurance analysis 	Multi-function magnetic stripe reader and OCR 	Two RS-232 serial ports and one universal serial bus (USB) port 	Remotely upgradeable software<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Fujitsu FI-4340C Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Fujitsu FI-4340C scanner to support Consular posts overseas.  The Fujitsu fi-4340C is a high-speed color capable scanner with top speed of 40 sheets per minute or 80 (when scanning both sides of each sheet) page images per minute.   It operates at approximately twice the speed of the previously reviewed fi-4220C.  The product complies and is able to operate within Consular Affairs (CA) Modernized Systems architecture.  This scanner meets specific requirements for CA Non-Immigrant Visa (NIV) applications.  It is also suitable for use with other CA applications.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The choice to use the FI-4340C as opposed to other document scanners available is that CA/CST/CS has acquired and fielded several hundred of these scanners since its inception in 2002.  The FI-4340C offers more features and is more robust than other scanners in this price range.  The continued use of Fujitsu scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  Furthermore, no additional training to those handling the scanner is necessary with the continued use of this scanner.   In addition, the document scanners require customized software.  Because the proprietary Consular applications (NIV, IVO, ACS+, and INK) have been developed to work with this specific document scanner, it is most cost effective to continue to use the Fujitsu FI-4340C rather than introduce another manufacturers product.  Another manufacturers product will require redesigning the CA applications.   CA/CST has selected the Fujitsu FI-4340C scanner because results obtain by the Bureaus System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoSs processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The Fujitsu FI-4340C scanner has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner for use with US visa programs.  Recently, the Homeland Security Council mandated the capture of all 10 fingerprints of visa applicants for whom US Consular officials receive information that indicates that they may have US law enforcement records.  On June 7, 2005, the Homeland Security Council decided as follows: "It should be the policy of the United States Government that biometric screening of foreign visitors to the United States be based on a fingerprint standard requiring 10-print capture at enrollment and 2-print verification thereafter."  Traditional fingerprint collection methods employing paper cards and ink are slow and inaccurate.  Due to this factor, the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to enhance and expedite the capture process by making it entirely electronic. Ten prints are needed to check the FBI ten-print fingerprint system Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) in order to ensure that we do not issue visas to criminals who are ineligible for visas.  The transition to ten prints is also necessary for the effective functioning of the IDENT fingerprint system because ten prints cause fewer false positives than two prints.   Consular Affairs is scheduled for 10-fingerprint capture rollout in April 2007. Cross Match L SCAN Guardian scanners are required for this project.  They were selected because they have been extensively tested and used by the FBI and piloted in London, Riyadh, San Salvador, and Islamabad by Consular Affairs.  The Guardian L SCAN is certified for both civil identification flats and full criminal 10-print rolls and flats, and the image quality complies with the FBI EFTS Appendix F.  Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner is found to be the most robust and reliable (in terms of output and data capture and interpretation) units of their kind now available.  Furthermore, the software that CA currently has only works with the Cross Match Guardian Scanners.<BR><BR>The addition of ten print fingerprint scanning technology will enable the Bureau to identify applicants with criminal or other US law enforcement records based on biometric data, regardless of the written personal information submitted on their applications.  This will ensure that the Department of State fully complies with Section 303 of The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.  The legislation specifically states that the Department of State must issue to aliens only machine-readable tamper resistant visas and other travel and entry documents that use biometric identifiers. CA requires that any fingerprint scanner must meet the following software compatibility requirements: 	Must utilize an IEEE-1394 PC interface for high speed and efficiency of processing. 	Must be able to read images from an Oracle database. 	Must be able to process the image and store the results into an Oracle database. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner requested without delay so that the pilot testing required for the verification of field functionality can commence as scheduled .<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. CA/CST requires the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner for use with US visa programs.  Recently, the Homeland Security Council mandated the capture of all 10 fingerprints of visa applicants for whom US Consular officials receive information that indicates that they may have US law enforcement records.  On June 7, 2005, the Homeland Security Council decided as follows: "It should be the policy of the United States Government that biometric screening of foreign visitors to the United States be based on a fingerprint standard requiring 10-print capture at enrollment and 2-print verification thereafter."  The Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner meets the following requirements: 	The scanner must be able to function as a drop-in replacement for the Smiths Heimann LS/2 Check fingerprint scanner and must perform at least as well as the Smiths Heimann LS/2 CHECK fingerprint scanner. 	The scanner must be evaluated against the current Ten-Print Capture Scanner and Software Requirements specifications. The Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board.   (5)	A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid. (6)	A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. A market survey conducted by CA/CST resulted in the submission of Cross Match Technologies quotation number CA3507, CounterTrade Products quotation number 0150416, Apptis quotation number 70035 to allow the Government to formulate a best cost estimate for the desired servers.  It is anticipated the final award will be issued to the entity providing the best pricing in the course of a competition to be conducted by the Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM). (7) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: No other information is provided to support the use of other than full and open competition<BR><BR>

<RESPDATE>050807
<ARCHDATE>11082007
<CONTACT>Harold D Hincks, Contracting Officer, 513-246-0586, david.hincks@emcbc.doe.gov;Angela M Cooney, Contract Specialist, 513-246-0562, Angela.Cooney@emcbc.doe.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST (EOI) FOR DISPOSITION OF NICKEL  PORTSMOUTH/PADUCAH PROJECT OFFICE AND OAK RIDGE OFFICE The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking Expressions of Interest (EOI) from industry related to the DOEs evaluation of alternatives to disposition approximately 15,300 tons of nickel scrap recovered from uranium enrichment process equipment.  The nickel must be transported, processed, and/or reused/recycled into products suitable for use in support of controlled government and/or commercial radiological applications.  This material is NOT intended for unrestricted release for recycling into commerce.  A portion of the nickel also must be declassified.  DOE intends to evaluate a number of alternatives for the disposition of this nickel; therefore, this request for EOIs does not commit DOE to issue a future solicitation, to award a contract, or to pay any costs incurred in the development and submission of any response.  Submission of a response to this request is not a pre-requisite for an interested party to participate in a follow-on solicitation should DOE, in its sole discretion, elect to issue such solicitation.  Any EOI submitted by industry should not anticipate DOE providing funds in support of the nickel dispositioning.  Instead, it is anticipated that the cost of processing and dispositioning the nickel would be offset by the value of processed nickel obtained by a successful bidder in a follow-on solicitation should DOE, in its sole discretion, elect to issue such solicitation. The nickel scrap consists of approximately 9,700 tons of unclassified nickel ingots stored at the DOE site in Paducah, Kentucky, and 5,600 tons of classified shredded nickel scrap stored at the former DOE uranium enrichment facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  The Paducah nickel ingots and Oak Ridge shredded nickel are volumetrically contaminated with uranium and trace quantities of technetium, neptunium, and plutonium.  Based on samples taken from several sets of the Paducah nickel ingots, selective radiological properties and metallurgical purity are presented in Attachment 1.  A similar summary is not available for the Oak Ridge nickel.  The end use of the nickel would be restricted for controlled reuse in government and/or commercial radiological applications.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)

Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT) 

AMENDMENT 02
	
This is an amendment to a request for information and not a solicitation.

At the 30-31 January 2007 Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT) Working Group in Colorado Springs, a question was raised concerning the strategy of the STAT program office and whether a competitive source selection was intended.  A firm strategy had not been determined at that point.  The Government has now decided to pursue a competitive source selection for the STAT development.  Detailed information on the particular strategy and schedule of events will be made available in Federal Business Opportunities as the strategy matures.  The STAT team will continue to perform market research by hosting working group meetings with industry and Government personnel to hone in on the system requirements until the solicitation is released (expected date of release of the Draft Request for Proposal is three to six months).  We look forward to exchanging ideas with our industry partners and using their expertise to bring this critical capability into operation.  Please direct any questions to Ms. Kathy Swanson, Contracting Officer, AEDC/PKM (see contact information below).

FYI.  The STAT will be a testbed facility that will be used to test space system survivability against natural, environmental, and man-made effects.  STAT will provide connectivity to a satellite control center (SOC) for systems under test in order to train space operators to recognize threats and aid in the development of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to mitigate the effects of those threats.  STAT is envisioned to include space chambers with realistic natural space environmental conditions, as well as integrated representative threat sources.   STAT Spiral 1 will develop the technology to integrate and control the various environmental sources and build a capability to test sub-system size components and microsats.

<DESC>Attention Explosive Manufacturers The US Army Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) has recently  released Revision B to MIL-PRF-46676, Flexible Explosive.  This specification  describes the performance requirements for two grades of flexible explosive  material used in Department of Defense demolition products. This specification contains a qualification requirement that provides for  products to be evaluated prior to, and independent of, any procurement action.   Qualification testing of new products is extensive and may take as long as 180  days, but may not be initiated until after completion of the formal  application/acceptance process.  Interested explosive suppliers are urged to  contact the Government qualifying activity identified below to receive detailed  guidance on the qualification process.   Upon successful completion of qualification, a new qualified products list  (QPL) will be published, listing only those products qualified to MIL-PRF- 46676B.  Future Government solicitations for Flexible Explosive will only  accept bids for products listed on the current QPL-46676.    Information  pertaining to qualification of Flexible Explosive products may be obtained from  U.S. Army ARDEC, ATTN: AMSRD-AAR-QES-E, Picatinny, N.J. 07806-5000 or by email  at ardec-stdzn@pica.army.mil.  The Army POC for this action is Rex Powell,  (973) 724-6662.  This Market Survey is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as  a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government.   The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this  Market Survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.  Please identify any  proprietary information submitted.  Respondents will not be notified of the  results of the survey.

<SUBJECT>99--REVISED NOTICE - United Launch Alliance (ULA) Industry Day to inform industry of the Federal Trade Commission's Consent Order regarding ULA and the role of the Compliance Officer to oversee compliance with the Consent Order.
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. The Department of Defense, National Security Space Office, intends to hold a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Industry Day. The purpose of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Industry Day is to inform industry of the Federal Trade Commission's Consent Order regarding ULA and  the role of the Compliance Officer to oversee compliance with the Consent Order.   The Order is intended to ensure that ULA affords all satellite manufacturers non- discriminatory treatment for launch services and that Lockheed and Boeing, as satellite  manufacturers, consider all qualified launch vehicle providers on a non-discriminatory  basis.  The order also requires firewalls to prevent information from a satellite or other  launch vehicle provider from being shared by ULA with its Boeing or Lockheed Martin  parent.  The role of the Compliance Officer is to oversee compliance with the Consent  Order by all three respondents and to investigate any complaint or representation arising  in relation to or connected with compliance of this order.  DATE:  The United Launch Alliance Industry Day will be on April 5, 2007.  Attendance to the ULA Industry Day is limited to two (2) representatives per organization.  It is required that all attendees register online (http://www.aero.org/conferences/ula).   ADDRESS:  The meeting location is at The Aerospace Corporation located at 2350 East El Segundo Boulevard, Building A8 Conference Room, El Segundo, California   NSSO welcomes the attendance from members of the general public, but for security  reasons all attendees must be United States citizens with a valid photo identification for admission into The Aerospace Corporation facility. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Alan L. Adams, 310-336-7476 or  DeeDee Madrid, 310-336-7256 or Douglas Brown, 310-416-7704.   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  The Director of National Security Space Office,  Office of the Under Secretary of the Air Force, United States Air Force was appointed as  the Compliance Officer for Department of Defense in keeping with a decree issued by the  United States District court, District of Colombia.  The Anti-Trust Division of the  Department of Justice brought suit against Northrop-Grumman Corporation to prevent  their merger with TRW, Incorporated because it would substantially reduce competition  in production of certain satellites.  However, the merger was permitted with the  agreement that Northrop-Grumman Corporation would comply with certain prescribed  behaviors decreed in the Final Judgment.  The Compliance Division was established  within NSSO to monitor the Northrop-Grumman Corporation's compliance with the  Final Judgment on behalf of the Director, who has contracted with the Aerospace  Corporation for much of the administrative support.

<SUBJECT>52 -- Chillers
<DESC>The ChillerCheck chiller is a diagnostic tool which provides critical mechanical equipment performance information and real-time data analysis on the efficiency and reliability of house chiller plant equipment in GSA controlled buildings. The
diagnostic tool provides GSA Regions and Facility Managers with actionable information, in electronic and printed reports, regarding the efficiency of chiller plant operations that use the ChillerCheck software.  These reports, coupled with specific corrective measures, provided through the software, assist the Facility Managers in targeting plant operations with problems, and providing optimal cost effective and efficient remedial action.  The software also provides plant operators a communication and network tool to digitally upload logged readings and operational data from building chillers for analysis, and to transfer this content to the Contractor?s website via a HotSync operation.  This is accomplished through the mechanics use of the unique ChillerCheck software that is installed on handheld Palm Tungsten E2 PDA computing devices.

<SUBJECT>--Announcment for JTRS Industry Day!
<DESC>The Communications-Engineering Research, Development and Engineering Center's Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate will be hosting an Industry Day on Thursday, 22 March 2007.  The purpose of this Industry Day is to make industry, as well other Government agencies, aware of the existence and availability of technologies developed in support of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS) Radios.   The Affordable Software Defined Radio (SDR) Components for JTRS Army Technology Objective - Manufacturing (ATO-M) is a Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) effort initiated to reduce the risks of the JTRS HMS Small Form Fit (SFF) development. The SDR JTRS AT O-M is focused on reducing the Size, Weight and Power - Cost (SWAP-C) of the SFF core transceiver. The core transceiver will be reused throughout all variants of the JTRS SFF and therefore allows this ManTech effort to make the greatest possible impact on SWAP-C for the overall JTRS program. The SDR JTRS ATO-M began in FY03 and has been working on four technology areas that relate to the core transceiver; Chip Scale Packaging (CSP) for the baseband processor, a 10W power amplifier based on GaN, wideband tunable RF filters, and an RF Integrated  Circuit (RFIC) chipset. Great strides have been made in these technology areas and the SDR MTO would like to make industry as well as the government aware of their existence and availability. The SDR JTRS ATO-M Industry Day will be held at the Myer Center of Ft. Monmouth, NJ on Thursday, 22 March 2007. Questions of a technical nature should be addressed to Lisa Rulli at 732-427-4646 or lisa.rulli@us.army.mil. Attached is the Visitors Access For m required for non-government visitors at Fort Monmouth. Please RSVP to June Zimmerman at 732-427-2762 or june.natalie.zimmerman@us.army.mil by COB 16 March 2007.

Written inquiries or comments regarding this announcement may be emailed to hilbert.caesar@va.gov Please reference Intent to Sole Source - Beretta 92D Nine Millimeter Statement of Work- Firearms 1.  Introduction: In 1996, the VA initiated a Pilot Program to Arm VA Police Officers.  Since that date, 12 VA medical facilities, employing approximately 315 police officers, have carried firearms as part of their daily duties.  After a careful review of the results of the Pilot Program, it was decided to design a program to arm police officers at additional facilities. The Office of Security and Law Enforcement, in conjunction with the Veterans Health Administration, has developed a Firearms Implementation Plan.  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has approved this plan.    2.  Background:  VA Police officers enforce Federal Law and VA Rules, provide police patrol and response services to over 172 VA medical facilities nationwide.  There are currently approximately 2,100 police officers employed by the VA.  These officers respond to reported crimes, patrol facilities that are located in a wide range of settings (urban, suburban, and rural), investigate crimes and arrest violators. VA Police officers work with a wide range of hospitalized veterans, their families, medical staff and the public.  This includes providing assistance to patients and staff in locked psychiatric units. Until the advent of the Pilot Program, VA Police officers were armed with the side-handle baton and a chemical irritant aerosol projector. For many years these non-lethal weapons were deemed more appropriate for the medical care environment than firearms.  Changes in the type of incidents confronting VA police officers led to the development of the Pilot Program. The VA has determined that the 9mm double action only semi-automatic pistol is the most suitable for use by its police officers.  Because of the environments in which they work and the nature of their duties it is essential that the firearm carried by VA Police officers be equipped with certain safety features. The double action only design, with no external safety devices or levers, best meets those needs.  In addition, we have determined during the Pilot Program that a trigger pull of 9 to 11 lbs. for the first and each successive shot, allows consistency in safety, training and use, especially for new or inexperienced shooters. Training and duty protocol requires that the service pistol have a magazine disconnector type safety device. This critical safety feature will allow the VA officer to disable the pistol even though a round is in the chamber. The magazine disconnect feature is necessary because VA Police Officers may be required to respond to an emergency in a locked psychiatric or other unit where a loaded firearm is not appropriate (or may be dangerous).  A magazine disconnector device that completely disables the weapon, provides a large margin for safety with minimal effort needed on the part of the responding officer. VA Police Officers work in a wide range of environmental and weather conditions.  The selected pistol must be constructed of a durable material with a finish that is highly resistant to corrosion. The pistol design must be easy for beginning shooters to the master level, and fit a wide range of hand sizes.  Ease of maintenance and field stripping for cleaning is also required. A VA Police Officer will be required to fire 1100 or more rounds during the course of initial Firearms Training.  The officer will fire 500 or more rounds each year, in order to maintain firearms qualification.  Therefore, we anticipate that a service pistol could be required to fire 11,000 or more rounds during an officer's career. 3.	Delivery Sites and Locations Supplies shall be delivered to various Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Centers, hereafter referred to as VAMC, throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  Each delivery order will be written with the correct VAMC address, including a VA Police Office point of contact and all other delivery information.  Firearms not purchased by VA Facilities by June 2007 will be purchased by the VA Law Enforcement Training Center on a separate delivery order. Technical Specifications. 1.  Caliber:	9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9mm NATO or 9X19 caliber. 	a.  The pistol shall be chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge.  (Note:  the terms "9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, or 9mm NATO" are industry standard descriptions and are not meant to restrict competition.) 	b.  Unless otherwise noted, any accuracy or endurance testing of the pistol will be with the VA approved service ammunition (Remington 9mm Golden Saber 124-gr. brass jacketed with controlled expansion.) 2.  Trigger mechanism   	a.  The pistol shall have double action only operating characteristics.  The trigger mechanism must move a hammer or striker to a fully cocked position and release it causing the weapon to fire.  There shall be no method of manually cocking the pistol other than by pulling the trigger.   	b.  Trigger pull shall not be less than 9 pounds and shall not exceed 11 pounds. 	c.  Each firing of the pistol shall require pulling the trigger through its entire length of travel.  Each pull of the trigger shall be consistent in both length and weight for the first and subsequent shots. 3.  Safety Devices 	a.  The pistol shall be equipped with a magazine disconnect-type safety device.  The pistol shall be incapable of being fired with the magazine removed, even if a live round is chambered. 	b.  The pistol shall be designed to function only with the magazines specific to the magazine disconnect device. 	c.  The pistol shall have no external safety devices, such as external safety levers or grip safeties.  There shall be no de-cocking or cocking lever. 	d.  The pistol shall have an internal firing pin blocking device or internal safety with a similar function. 	e.  The pistol shall have a mechanism, which prevents it from being fired without activation of the trigger. 	f.  A child safety lock shall be provided 4.  Physical Dimensions. 	a. Weight: The unloaded pistol should not exceed 40 ounces, including an empty magazine. 	b.  Barrel length: Should not be less than 3.4 nor exceed 4.9 inches. 5.  Magazines 	a.  Magazines:  Shall be the maximum capacity available for the pistol model provided.  Restricted law enforcement magazines, with capacity of or greater than 11 rounds of the VA service ammunition, are required. . 	b.  Magazine release: Shall be either ambidextrous or reversible for the use of left-handed shooters.  Reversible models will be able to be modified by factory trained Armorer's at the field level. 	c.  Magazine well: The edges of the magazine well shall be beveled or flared.  	d.  Magazine shall lock positively in the magazine well 	e.  Magazines shall release and fall free from the magazine well when the magazine release is fully pressed, whether magazine is full, partially loaded, or empty. 	f.  The magazine follower shall move freely within the magazine body without binding and position each round for positive feeding. 	g.  The magazine shall be constructed of a rust and corrosion resistant material.  It shall have "witness holes" which permit viewing of the number of rounds in a full or partially loaded magazine. 	h.  The vendor shall supply a minimum of 3 magazines with each service pistol provided to VA. 6.  Sights. 	a.  The front and rear sights shall be fitted with a self-luminous system, which allows shooters to quickly and effectively engage targets in low-level light.  The sights shall be properly aligned, allowing accurate shooting of the weapon.  The low-light sights shall contain tritium or an equivalent self-luminous material, and have a serviceable visibility warranted by the vendor for a minimum of ten years.  The low-light sights shall be impervious to damage by commonly used firearms cleaning solvents and lubricants.  The luminous portion of the sights shall not be visible from the muzzle end of the pistol. 	b.  Sight dimensions must allow the shooter to acquire sight alignment rapidly.  Sights must not interfere with the holstering and drawing of the pistol using standard commercially available concealment that is equipped with three independent restraining devices on the duty holster. 	c.  Sights shall be adjustable for windage and/or elevation.  If the pistol is so equipped, adjustment devices shall lock into place and be protected from inadvertent damage, such as may occur if the pistol is dropped.  The manufacturer at the rate of one tool will provide any sight adjustment tools required for each armed VA medical center. 7.  Slide/slide lock and release. 	a.  It must be possible to manually lock the slide to the rear for visual and physical inspection of the pistol, with a magazine inserted. 	b.  The slide shall automatically lock to the rear during normal operation after the last round in a magazine has been fired, or if the slide is pulled to the rearmost position with an empty magazine in place. 	c.  The slide lock/release shall be capable of proper manipulation by either the right or left hand when using a two-handed grip.  The lock/release control shall be designed so that it cannot be inadvertently activated or over-ridden during normal firing. 	d.  The gripping surfaces of the slide shall permit a firm grasp and reliable operation of the slide by the shooter under all conditions. 	e.  Gripping surfaces of the slide shall be located on the right and left sides, near the rearmost portion, readily accessible to the shooter.  The location of these surfaces shall be such that, during the manual operation of the slide, the shooter's hand does not cover or obstruct the ejection port. 8.  Pistol construction 	a.  The exterior finish of the pistol (frame, slide and magazines, while locked in the pistol) shall be non-reflective.  	b.  The barrel shall be made of blue steel, stainless carbon steel or of a comparable material.   	c.

<DESC>This solicitation, 2007-N-09233, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a firm, fixed price purchase order to the successful offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government for the following requirement: CLIN 0001 Review/Assessment of OMS.  Strategic review and assessment of the existing version 2.0 of the Outbreak Management System (OMS), as further described by the Statement of Work. Quantity: 1 Job.
STATEMENT OF WORK. 
I. OVERVIEW. 

The Outbreak Management System (OMS) is a public health information networks (PHIN), standards-based, data collection, analysis, and reporting tool that supports investigations of public health events or acts of bioterrorism.   OMS supports public health officials who perform the vital activities necessary to investigate an outbreak.  Configured to meet the needs of various public health events (e.g., smallpox, tuberculosis, SARS), OMS supports the capture of case-based data from cases and contacts and exposures and relationships.

II.	BACKGROUND.

OMS addresses the CDC response to the Congressional Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 that specifically requires the HHS Secretary to establish a national and integrated system for public health in support of terrorism response and prevention.  It also addresses the requirements of local and state partner?s response to the 2005 Cooperative Agreement Guidance for Public Health Emergency Preparedness.

During the chaotic period following a natural occurring outbreak or public health event (e.g. SARS, monkeypox) or the deliberate use of a threat, including biological, chemical, and radiological agents, public health authorities gather the information necessary to identify, investigate, analyze, monitor, and respond.  Public health authorities must obtain a dynamic, high-level, yet granular insight into the incident, trace people possibly exposed to communicable diseases or conditions, and trace exposures to possible disease vectors or investigate theoretical conveyance paths.  Yet, there are no systematic, standards-based tools that collect and manage data of this type.  As a result, because there many investigators use different tools, the ability to aggregate and analyze data from a multi-jurisdiction investigation is neither efficient nor effective.  Time is wasted on mapping, translating, and inferring data derived from various tools.  Further, not all data are captured consistently to enable the establishment and maintenance of data linkages.

OMS uses a PHIN, standards-based set of public health informatics rules to manage outbreaks during a public health event.  OMS captures standard demographic and exposure data; configures outbreak-specific vocabularies; performs analyses; creates dynamic questionnaires, reports, and outbreak-specific packages; manages case and contact investigations; imports data; records epidemiologic linkages; and allows for managing exposed contacts.  

OMS is a key component of the PHIN.  In order to expand local, state, and federal capacity, OMS provides the technical specifications and standards as well as a PHIN-compliant system for state and local partners to use in order to proactively manage outbreaks.

III.	SCOPE OF WORK.

The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, transportation, training and other materials necessary to provide a detailed review, assessment, and recommend improvements for the Outbreak Management System (OMS).  The performance shall occur onsite at CDC facilities in Atlanta, Georgia.

VI.  OBJECTIVES.
The evaluation and assessment will identify:
a.	Current CDC national-level business practices and preferences for outbreak investigation (OMS and non-OMS);
i.	Measure the usefulness/utility of the current system (OMS or non-OMS); 
ii.	What improvements to their current system do CDC users want;
b.	Inventory of tools used at CDC for outbreak management and compare and contrast each tool?s strengths and weaknesses; 
c.	Determine what types of integration with other data systems (e.g., NEDSS, BioSense, LRN) would most benefit interoperability and comply with PHIN standards; 
d.	Determine types of integration with other outbreak management software (e.g., Epi Info, CRA) would most benefit interoperability and comply with PHIN standards; 
e.	Compare OMS current functionality with functionality identified for a multi-jurisdictional outbreak; 
f.	Develop tactical approach to better adoption of OMS;
i.	Assess and review user acceptance testing and methodology used for OMS;
ii.	Assess and review prototypes used for OMS;
g.	Assess/review existing OMS functional requirements, business case, business case and feature set to determine strengths and weaknesses of the current version and identify gaps of new/needed functionality.

V.  TASKS.

Task 1: Assess and review current project model and business practices.

The Contractor shall conduct a strategic review of the Outbreak Management System (OMS).  This assessment and review is to be conducted among centers, Institutes and offices (CIOs) as determined by the Project Officer. This assessment will also include CDC subject matter experts (SMEs). 

Task 2: Specify barriers to adoption.

The contractor shall identify and specify barriers to adoption of OMS by conducting interviews with CDC Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and other officials as determined by the CDC Project Officer.  

Task 3: Recommend Improvements.

Upon completion of interviews and assessments, the Contractor shall recommend  improvements to CDC (programs/ CIOs) and CDC SMEs. 

Task 4: Software review.

The Contractor shall assess and evaluate the business case for a standardized, national application that meets outbreak management functional requirements This assessment will encompass commerical best practices, system interoperability and adherence to Public Health Information Networks (PHIN) standards. 


VI.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research Office (ARO) together with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) announces the availability of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. W911NF-07-R-0008  for the detection of Improvised Explosive Dev ices (IEDs).  ARO is soliciting proposals from degree-granting universities in conjunction with government laboratories and/or industry partners to invent, explore, and evaluate new approaches for detection of explosives.  Proposals are sought in one category only: Standoff Detection of Explosive Threats. The Government anticipates the award of instruments to support several university-based centers in the United States to conduct the research sought in this BAA. The center(s) may draw on university programs in physical, engineering, and mathematical scienc es. Each center must have active, working collaborations with established industry partners and/or US government laboratories to aid in the transition of technology. These partnerships must represent at least 20% of the proposed effort. Multiple universiti es/ organizations may participate in a single center.  Support for each center is estimated to be $1M/year, inclusive of partnerships with industry and/or government laboratories.  Theory and Experiment:  Explosives detection inherently requires the discrimination of a weak signal within a noisy environment.  This effort aims to build on previous advances in spectroscopy and remote chemical sensing by, using multiple orthogonal, nonl inear or newly developed spectroscopic approaches. Modeling and Simulation:  Among the range of possible approaches, proper modeling and simulation will enable the best systems to be chosen for experimental development and evaluation.  Modeling and simulation will also provide objective measures of success  for evaluating new systems and comparing one system against another. Interested offerors are required to submit white papers in accordance with instructions provided in Section IV of this BAA.   Informal white papers no more than ten pages in length outlining the proposed project, a summary of investigator qualifications, a nd a budget estimate must be received by 4:00 PM Local (NC) Time on Monday, April 16, 2007. White papers are required prior to proposal submission.  White papers must be transmitted to the following e-mail address: whitepapers@arl.army.mil.  The e-mail sub ject line should contain the following:  W911NF-07-R-0008 Proposal White Paper. The broad agency announcement for this program is located at the ARO web site: http://www.arl.army.mil/main/main/default.cfm?Action=6&Page=8.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 -- Research and Development in the Physi cal, Engineering, and Life Sciences.  The Government reserves the right to not make an award if it is not in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (Amendment 7) to solicitation H92222-07-R-0055, UHF Satellite Command (SATCOM) Antennas, is to cancel the Government requirement for CLIN 1005 thru 5005, AV 2091-2 or Equal Product.  The Government cancellation of CLIN 1005 thru 5005, AV 2091-2 or Equal Product, is the result of the Government issuing an inaccurate specification for this requirement.  The Government intends to resolicit at a later date for the AV 2091-2 or Equal Product.  The Government also cancels the requirements for CLINs 1009 thru 5009, Cable RF Coaxial, 3 foot, Max Qty 5,000 (Year 1 thru 5); CLINs 1010 thru 5010 Cable RF Coaxial, 8 foot, Max Qty 5,000 (Year 1 thru 5); CLINs 1011 thru 5011 Cable RF Coaxial, 12 foot, Max Qty 5,000 (Year 1 thru 5); CLINs 1012 thru 5012 Cable RF Coaxial, 25 foot, Max Qty 5,000 (Year 1 thru 5); CLINs 1013 thru 5013 Cable RF Coaxial, 150 foot, Max Qty 5,000 (Year 1 thru 5).  The Government requirement for Coaxial Cables is unwarranted for this solicitation as the Government no longer has a current requirement for the cables.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 to Reference Number SB3100-7037-3111 on epoxy dispensing machine is issued to answer questions and to submit Application Requirements and Material Specifications to the Specifications in order to clarify data.  

1.   What is the shot size requirement and how long does it have to dispense?  
 
Answer:  The minimum shot size, under low volume to read 9.444 grams. 
 
2.   How many shots are there before the pots have to be refilled? 
 
Answer:   The number of shots is directly related to the shot size.  2 - 5 gallon tanks divided by 7.182 cc min & 47.878 cc max Shot Size 

 3.  Has a consideration been given to pump directly from the drums the material comes in and eliminating the pressure pots?  
 
Answer:  The reason for the tanks rather than pumping out of the containers is portability.  The Government needs to move the unit around the warehouse floor and the bulk of the units used to pump the liquid out of the cans would increase the size of the cart and limit this use
