In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (15) (i), All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

This notice of intent is not a request for competition.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation

<CONTACT>Vallerie M Redd, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2845, Fax 770-488-2670, Email gfj3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences, intends to award a sole source contract to Ametek, Inc., 801 South Illinois Avenue, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-0895 for the maintenance of Ametek laboratory instruments. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months.<br />&nbsp;
<p>Ametek, Inc. is a global manufacturer of electronic instruments and electromagnetic devices, of which many have been custom designed for the CDC's Inorganic and Radiation Analytical Toxicology Laboratory. Therefore, since Ametek developed the software, hardware, and instrumentation packages for the laboratory instruments such as gamma and alpha spectrometers, the high-purity geranium gamma detectors, and the sodium iodide detectors purchased at NCEH/DLS, Ametek has the unique perspective of not only being the manufacturer, but knows the product, as well as processes all the parts and information to repair the instrumentation. Accordingly, Ametek possesses the patented technical data specific to the laboratory instrumentation currently being utilized. In addition, because the instrumentation and software purchased are proprietary, no other manufacturer can provide the required software function upgrades. Considering this information, there are currently no other vendors with the capability to repair these instruments or satisfy the program's requirements regarding such.</p>
<p>The instruments designed by Ametek are highly complex with integrated computer operations and dedicated software. Therefore, their proper maintenance and repair requires a high degree of technical skills and long-term familiarity with the instruments. As previously mentioned, Ametek is the manufacturer of the instruments requiring maintenance services and thus has all the parts, schematics, and other information to repair the system.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Ametek, Inc. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2011-Q-13117 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN January 19, 2011.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<CONTACT>BAA Coordinator, Email DARPA-BAA-11-24@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of Anti-Submarine Warfare surveillance. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.&nbsp; The Deep Sea Operations program intends to develop an ASW surveillance capability that operates at extreme ocean depths to detect quiet submarines overhead. In 2010, DARPA initiated architecture studies for the Deep Sea Operations program. The studies addressed system solutions for configurable technology to achieve ASW surveillance over large, operationally relevant, deep ocean areas. Broad guidance served as a framework for performers to develop a wide range of solutions that would:
<p>&bull; Operate with sensors or sources near the ocean bottom <br />&bull; Exploit the advantages of distributed and unmanned nodes<br />&bull; Configure to a range of operations, environments, and time scales<br />&bull; Adapt to the mobility of the surface assets or evolving threats</p>
<p>The intent was to identify key technologies for (1) sensors and processing, (2) communication (between nodes and between nodes and airborne, seaborne, or terrestrial assets), (3) mobility, and (4) energy (harvesting, re-supplying, or storage). DARPA sought ambitious technology in one or more of these areas to drive useful trades in the remaining areas. These architecture studies have provided insights that shape this solicitation.</p>
<p>This BAA solicits the next phases of the DSOP program referred to as Phase 1b, Phase 2, and Phase 3. Phase 1b completes technology risk reduction for the program that began with architecture studies in 2010, and is open to all proposers. A classified addendum to this BAA establishes intended DSOP capability with quantified metrics described in terms of minimum performance thresholds, and corresponding goals to exceed the thresholds. Phase 2 will result in a scalable system prototype. Phase 2 will emphasize at-sea demonstration of an effective DSOP sonar solution that can exceed the minimum thresholds for detecting and holding track of a submarine target. Phase 3 will then serve to scale the prototype sonar system to achieve the final goals of the program. During this phase, a system team will integrate a broad range of technology for energy, communications, planning tools, and Navy systems to demonstrate a compelling capability.</p>
<p>Proposals should describe a sonar system intended for development that will achieve large area coverage, significant fractional hold time, low operational cost, and other metrics detailed in the BAA addendum. While fixed systems may achieve mobility through rapid deployment, this procurement will favor ambitious system designs that employ deep ocean platform mobility to achieve the desired metrics given near equal system costs. The best DSOP solutions will benefit from future advances in energy capacity or delivery that not only extend endurance, but which improve overall performance. Proposers should describe how their sonar systems will be flexible to future advances in energy and communications, and should highlight the resulting benefits.</p>
<p>For proposals to be considered, eligible proposers must have at least a secret facility clearance at the date of issue for this BAA, and evidence of the capability to conduct secret level research. Proposers are strongly encouraged to review the classified addendum to this BAA before considering a proposal submission. Section 4.1 and Appendix 2 provide the instructions to request the addendum materials.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Dionex Corporation of Sunnyvale, California for the purchase of an Analytical Autosampler with Fraction Collector under other than full and open competition. <br /><br />NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
<p>(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)<br /><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The Dionex WPS-3000 TFC Analytical Autosampler with Fraction Collector will be integrated to an existing High Performance Liquid Chromatographic system recently purchased by NIST. The instrument will be 100% compatible with the existing system. Dionex holds the proprietary rights to the existing equipment and technology. Deviations away from the Dionex WPS-3000 TFC Analytical Autosampler with Fraction Collector would cause needless replication of auxiliary equipment, compatibility issues with software and would result in significant duplication of cost to NIST in both hardware and man-hours. Dionex is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this system. As a result, Dionex is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on January 18, 2010. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joshua.holliday@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis with Ms. Patricia Eagen, R.N., 541 Sassafras Drive, Lebanon, Pennsylvania, 17042-8718 to provide consultant services as a registered nurse for a genetic study on Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Medical Genetics Branch.
 
The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations largest medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Medical Genetics Branch, is currently conducting a Genetic Study of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in North America.  Currently the Medical Genetics Branch is interviewing families of children affected with ADHD who have one or more siblings, after obtaining informed consent/assent and determining that their family structure and history make them suitable candidates for a genetic study.  NHGRI estimate that for the whole study, 5,000 probands and one or more of their siblings will be interviewed by telephone over several years from different sites in the United States.  Thus far, over 1200 families have been enrolled to date.

Ms. Patricia Eagen has specific attributes which make her uniquely qualified for her position in our study on ADHD.  She is a registered nurse with a Bachelor of Science degree as well as current licensure. She has extensive experience in genetic studies of ADHD, as she has been part of several genetic studies of ADHD prior to work on our ADHD protocol.   In addition has previously worked with NHGRI during the last 8 years and with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) at the National Institute of Health.  Ms. Eagen has obtained a unique level of expertise in the application of complex questionnaires for the specific evaluation of ADHD related symptoms.  This level of expertise is necessary to conduct our studies.  In addition, Ms. Eagen has over 30 years of experience working with ADHD parents, support and advocacy groups. Her familiarity with ADHD-specific research tools, breadth of knowledge, extensive experience in working with families in our and related studies, personal skills and flexibility to understand the needs of families with this condition have been fundamental in the allowing us to meet enrollment goals.  Most importantly, her qualifications make her uniquely able to carry out our research goals.  

A new component of this study will require more dedicated participation by the Contractor. The Contractor is critical for progress in this new aspect of our study. Specifically, this study has recently been amended to allow us to enroll patients from the Amish population in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. This will be done in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania.  Ms. Eagen is the only research nurse we know of who can see and administer research tests to a large number of patients in our target population in person and has the professional and personal qualifications NHGRI requires to complete this study.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 621399, Offices of All Other Miscellaneous Health Practitioners with business size standard in dollars $7.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-48 (December 30, 2010). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by January 8, 2011, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><br /><br />The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is conducting market research for R&amp;D efforts that will assist in the determination of the availability of industry and academic sources. AFRL is seeking potential offerors with the capability and capacity to provide applied research and development activities in support of AFRL's NASCAP-2K software code. The NASCAP-2K software is a spacecraft charging and plasma simulation software package focused on determining the effects of the space environment on satellites, both in design and development and in post-anomaly resolution. The capabilities include surface charging in both Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), potentials in space, particle tracking, currents in space, hybrid and full Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation, and dielectric stresses on realistic satellite geometries. Most of these capabilities are capable of being run on a standard desktop in minutes to hours. Research and development is required to upgrade the capabilities of NASCAP-2K in order to meet the developing needs of the AFRL as new regimes and technologies are investigated.
<p><strong><br />STATEMENT OF NEED:</strong> This effort will require a potential offeror to have a demonstrable working knowledge of the NASCAP-2K software. The scope of the work will require an understanding NASCAP-2K both as a research platform for simulations as well as the interrelationships between the components of the software. A strong background in physics of spacecraft charging and techniques of computational simulation is desired by the company.<br />AFRL is seeking offerors to provide research and development efforts that are necessary for code maintenance, research of simulation techniques, and simulation of problems of interest to the Air Force Research Laboratory. The period of performance of this contract is expected to be approximately 60 months from the date of award and is expected to be divided into two major tasks; Task 1. Applied Research and Task 2. Advanced Technology Development (ATD). Task 2 is then further subdivided into four major areas of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1. Applied Research (6.2):</strong> <br />Apply NASCAP-2K to instruments and problems as identified by the Government.<br />a. Model satellites and instruments as identified by the Government.<br />b.

<DESC>The 30th Contracting Squadron is publicizing this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE in order to gather industry information and input from qualified and interested 8(a) sources in the State of California with respect to a potential Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER) program at Vandenberg AFB, CA and tentatively at Los Angeles AFB, CA, and Edwards AFB, CA. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result. The Air Force will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. Any future solicitation, including specifications and/or drawings, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/). Interested Parties are solely responsible for monitoring the aforementioned website for the release of a solicitation package and/or any updates and/or amendments.
<p>The government is seeking to identify qualified, experienced, and interested potential businesses capable of performing the type of work as described herein. The envisioned SABER program would consist of multiple, firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts to provide a vehicle for executing a broad range of maintenance, repair and new construction of buildings, facilities, or base infrastructure. In general, SABER program contractors would be given fair opportunity to compete for projects described in individual task order solicitations and would be expected to accomplish a wide variety of construction tasks, including renovation, additions/upgrades, abatement, and new construction integrating multiple construction trades/disciplines. Work may include developing a project design from at least a 35% design, concept, or performance-oriented statement of objectives. In-house design capability or ready access to design capability is a must for projects under SABER. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI), is to gain information from qualified and interested 8(a) sources in the State of California with experience relative to the anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 / Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a size standard of $33,500,000. All interested parties are invited to respond and must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (http://www.ccr.gov/) prior to award.</p>
<p>The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Should a future requirement evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated that as many as four (4) contracts could be awarded, each for a term consisting of one base year plus four, 1-year option periods. Task Orders written against SABER contracts are anticipated to range between $2,000 and $5,000,000. The overall program value is still under consideration; accordingly, at this point it is roughly anticipated to range between $100,000,000 and $150,000,000 over a five-year period. The guaranteed minimum contract amount is $5,000 for the basic period only.</p>
<p>If your firm has an interest in proposing on future requirements as described above, please prepare and transmit a Capability Statement to Stella Schoenberg or William Davis via mail addressed to 30 CONS/LGCA, 1515 Iceland Ave, Bldg 8500, Room 150, Vandenberg AFB, CA 93437-5212, fax to (805) 606-5867, or email to Stella.Schoenberg@vandenberg.af.mil and William.Davis@vandenberg.af.mil, not later than 4:00 PM PDT, 03 February 2011.

<DESC>Market Survey for Technology Assessment for theRemoval of Cast-Cured Thermoset Explosive Fills from Military Munitions

The U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command (ACC) Joint Munitions & Lethality (JM&L) Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, is conducting market research of companies capable of executing an engineering assessment to conduct a structured technology assessment study of environmentally acceptable technologies for removing cast-cured explosive fills from cavity-type munitions such as artillery projectiles, mortar projectiles, bombs, missile warheads, and torpedo warheads during demilitarization operations from munitions.  Cast-cured explosive fills in munitions items have been based primarily on RDX, ammonium perchlorate (AP), and aluminum (Al) powder in combination with thermosetting plastic binders which are used to permanently polymerize the solid compound material.  Once cured, the thermoset explosive offers desirable performance parameters compared to similar conventional melt-cast or pressed explosives.  However, these formulations present challenges to the demilitarization process because the thermoset curing process precludes cast-cured explosives from returning to a molten state with the application of heat.  Therefore, conventional munition demilitarization methods that rely on heat are ineffective explosive filler removal methods. The potential candidate methods need to be capable of removing cast-cured explosive fillers that have been loaded into fielded munition items.  
The effort is an engineering assessment that shall review potential demilitarization methods for cast-cured explosive filled munitions, execute an engineering analysis of the applicability and potential effectiveness of each technology and down select the most promising technologies as recommendations for further assessment and/or development work in the future. The evaluation shall include an evaluation matrix that at a minimum assesses technical maturity, environmental impact, safety, material recovery, implementation feasibility and cost.  The study shall rank the candidate technologies and identify those which are recommended for further investigation. 
Interested companies should respond by providing the government the following information: a brief summary of the companys capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past technical assessment experience as it relates to the below criteria.. A respondent to this survey should illustrate engineering/technical expertise in executing a structured technology assessment of candidate technologies based on literature reviews, communication/visits with owners of the candidate technologies and understanding of munitions systems.
Interested parties have 15 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information to be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy for this item. Interested parties that believe they can meet the above requirements shall provide their capabilities in manufacturing, and testing.  Responses should include their current business structures: (a) name of Company-include contact persons name, company address, telephone numbers (voice and fax), e-mail address, (b) Company size (i.e. large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc) 
This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government. The Government implies no intention or opportunity to acquire funding to support current or future production efforts. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.
All responding sources should submit their responses no later than 01-19-2011 to U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command (ACC) Joint Munitions & Lethality (JM&L) Contracting Center, Attn: Mr. Norman Davis,  Bldg 322 Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806- 5000.

<SOLNBR>RFI-OFR-11-0020
<RESPDATE>011411
<ARCHDATE>01052012
<CONTACT>L. Stanley, Contract Specialist, Phone  , Fax (304) 480-7204, Email PSB3@bpd.treas.gov
<DESC>On behalf of the U. S. Department of the Treasury ("the Department"), Office of Financial Research ("the OFR"), the Bureau of the Public Debt is issuing a Request for Information ("RFI") to identify industry suggestions and best practices regarding developing enterprise data, analytical, and information technology (IT) architectures necessary to support the mission of the OFR. The Department is seeking sources for a possible future acquisition to facilitate the planning and implementation of the strategy that will support the OFR's activities in data collection, standardization, warehousing and dissemination. This RFI solicits industry's interest and capability to meet the stated objectives and is for information and planning purposes only. This does not constitute a Request for Proposal ("RFP") or an Invitation for Bid ("IFB") or a promise to issue one in the future. Furthermore, the Department is not liable for any costs incurred as a result of vendor responses to this RFI. The Government does not intend to award a contract for any supply or service on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information. This request is issued for the purpose of (1) receiving information and feedback on the interest and capabilities of potential sources and (2) informing the Government on the type and scope of work involved in meeting the objectives outlined in this RFI. Please note that no solicitation is available at this time.
<p>BACKGROUND: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the DFA"), Pub. L. No. 111-203, establishes the OFR within the Department and provides it in part with the authority to collect data to support the Financial Stability Oversight Council ("the Council") and to set standards for reporting such data.</p>
<p>SCOPE: The Department is seeking information from private entities that currently possess expert and detailed knowledge in the set up and operation of large-scale data and analytic systems. Specifically, the Department seeks assistance in designing plans for the OFR's Data Center and Research and Analytics Center that will serve the key mission objectives of obtaining, housing, disseminating, and analyzing data for its customers. The Department is also interested in understanding current best practices for establishing a multi-disciplinary research and analytics organization that will seek to partner with academic and private research communities. Further, the Department seeks assistance in understanding current best practices and developing a secure IT infrastructure that will support these efforts.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is not to obtain comments on the future policy work of the OFR or the scope of its future data-related activities.</p>
<p>Rather, the Department is specifically interested in determining industry capability and best practices to assist the Department in establishing enterprise data, analytical, and IT architectures that will support the following activities:<br />1. Working with the regulatory community, private industry, and the academic community in establishing standards for financial data, including associated taxonomies, semantics, and messaging and reporting formats;<br />2. Collecting various financial and economic data from both public and private sources;<br />3. Processing, storing, and disseminating such data for use by OFR analysts, the regulatory community, and other research partners.<br />4. Facilitating the execution of compute-intensive models against a diverse set of market and economic data on a distributed compute infrastructure<br />5. Enabling large-scale financial and economic research activities that will require collaboration among individuals in multiple organizations and across multiple physical locations (i.e., OFR, academic institutions, regulatory organizations, etc.).<br />6. Providing for a systems life of four years.</p>
<p>Responders are requested to specifically address the following.<br />1) Describe your knowledge and expertise in building and operating large-scale, cost effective, enterprise data and analytic platforms in the Federal and private sector.<br />2) Describe your knowledge and expertise in developing taxonomies, semantics, and messaging and reporting formats for financial information.<br />3) Recognizing the highly-interconnected nature of the OFR ecosystem, and the large amounts of data OFR may consume, provide your recommendations on the type of database, file and job execution system (e.g.,, SQL, MPP, HDFS, HADOOP, etc.) the OFR should consider adopting.<br />4) What networking technologies would be most useful for the secure transfer of highly sensitive, potentially high volume, data between the OFR's Data Center and other entities (e.g., the Council and its member agencies)?<br />5) How might the use of secure, "cloud based" analytic resources be used to facilitate the mission objectives of the OFR while also enabling better control of the cost of compute and storage?<br />6) Based on your experience, what technologies should the OFR consider to enable it to more effectively manage the cost of storage while still providing high performance to its analytic/compute infrastructure?<br />7) What approaches should the OFR consider in enabling limited and graduated access to data for internal research purposes and external sharing with the regulatory community?<br />8) What are the key cost elements that will drive a vendor's cost proposal in response to a solicitation for creating an IT implementation plan for the OFR? Provide a rough order of magnitude for solution(s) that you are recommending. How can the Government control the costs for this type of analytical environment?<br />9) How should social, collaborative technologies be leveraged to enable a distributed community of analysts and researchers to function?<br />10) What are some suggested evaluation criteria that the Government should consider in the development of a Request for Proposal to create an implementation plan for the OFR IT infrastructure and Organizational Architecture for its Data Center and Research and Analysis Center should it choose to issue one? <br />11) Is the proposed solution or pieces of the solution and services available on a Federal schedule or other Government-wide vehicle? If yes, which schedule(s) or contracts?</p>
<p>12) Identify your business size classification (i.e., small, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Woman-owned). This request is based on NAICS 541512 which has a business size standard of $25 million. <br />13) Who is a point of contact at your organization (i.e., name, phone, email address) that we can contact for further information.</p>
<p>At the Government's option, we may schedule meetings to discuss or clarify information provided in response to this RFI or to request demonstrations of the proposed solution(s).</p>
<p>Any questions related to this request for information shall be directed to the email address listed in this notice. No contact shall be made to OFR staff.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Your response should be no more than thirty (30) one-side pages total, with print no smaller than 12 point. Responses must be submitted in Microsoft Word 2000 or later. Interested parties may submit their responses to this RFI to L. Stanley via e-mail at psb3@bpd.treas.gov. Reference RFI-OFR-11-0020 Attn: L. Stanley in the subject line. Responses to the RFI should address how the responder would meet the Government's requirements, as well as pose questions for clarification and suggestions for additional requirements that the Government should consider.

<CONTACT>Diane J Meeder, Phone (412)386-4412, Email DMeeder@cdc.gov
<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. <br /><br />The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), is seeking information on a potential requirement for Comprehensive Analytical Chemistry Support. <br /><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the NAICS code 541380 for the potential acquisition. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Draft Sample Work Statement:<br /></strong></span><br />NIOSH was established under the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (PL 91 596). NIOSH has the mandated responsibility for performing research into health and safety hazards found in the workplace. In carrying out this mission, field and research groups within NIOSH are in need of analytical laboratory support. <br />Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish the necessary facility, personnel, laboratory instrumentation, and all items and supplies necessary and shall exert its best effort to provide comprehensive analytical laboratory services in support of NIOSH industrial hygiene and research programs. Specifically, the Contractor shall:
<p>1. Sample Type and Quantity:</p>
<p>Perform analyses on approximately 800 samples per month. These samples will usually require multi-component analyses, typically two [2] to six [6] analytes/sample (analytical requests have averaged about three [3] analyses per sample). These projected totals include field samples plus duplicate analyses, and internally generated quality control samples. Samples will include industrial hygiene samples, such as filters, impinger solutions, solid sorbent tubes (analyses required for both front and backup sections); environmental samples, such as water, waste water or soils, wipe samples, air samples, bulk mixtures for pesticides, samples requiring dust or fiber counting, and bulk process materials Measurements on the above samples will require both quantitative and qualitative analyses according to the methods contained in the NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods (NMAM) (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-154/), 4th and 5th editions, and other established sources.</p>
<p>2. Perform routine analyses on NIOSH samples:</p>
<p>The Contractor's primary references for analytical methods will be the NMAM, (4th ed. and 5th ed.). Secondary sources include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration analytical methods, AIHA analytical guides, ASTM, ISO, Environmental Protection Agency manuals and methods, industrial hygiene technical literature, and finally, internally developed Contractor methods. NIOSH will supply new validated NMAM methods to the Contractor as they become available, and the new draft NMAM methods and CEMB procedures when needed.</p>
<p>3. Specialty Measurements.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be expected to evaluate properly and have supporting Quality Assurance (QA) for minor modifications from an established method such as applying an air method for wipe analysis of a given chemical. Also, when unexpected problems occur with an analytical method, the Contractor will validate modifications, such as variations in digestion or extraction techniques, use of alternate chromatography columns to achieve better separation and elimination of interferences, and necessary measures to optimize analytical techniques in the presence of interferents. Procedures initially defined as "specialty measurements" shall be considered routine for the purposes of calculating turnaround time if this procedure has been undertaken repeatedly and has effectively become routine.</p>
<p>On some occasions, the Contractor will be requested to perform a "User Check" of a newly developed NIOSH analytical method.</p>
<p>4. Assigned Method Development Projects:</p>
<p>The Contractor must be prepared to support projects not specifically described above, such as methods development for analytes not having established analytical methods.</p>
<p>5. Other Analysis.</p>
<p>At the request of the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), the Contractor will subcontract analyses not available because of a lack in-house instrumentation or expertise, perform analyses using in-house capabilities not specifically noted in the contract, and initiate new analytical techniques at the government's expense</p>
<p>6. Quality Control:</p>
<p>The CDC/NIOSH QA Manager shall enforce all aspects of the Contractor's quality control manual including modifications made by NIOSH.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to internally generate and analyze quality control samples at the target of 10% (within a range of 8-12%) of field samples to be distributed over all sample sets (multiple QA's over multiple subsequences). The Contractor will also be required to perform replicate analyses of field samples at the rate of 5% of the total field samples received by the Contractor.</p>
<p>8. Sample Tracking:</p>
<p>The Contractor will document procedures of sample receipt, logging, and handling. The Contractor will have and maintain a computerized logging system, Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), for managing samples submitted to the laboratory consistent with the guidelines for the AIHA Laboratory Accreditation Policies.</p>
<p>9. Sample Storage:</p>
<p>The contractor must maintain adequate and safe storage areas for samples and maintain a proper sample log-in procedure. Samples are to be logged and processed upon receipt at the laboratory.</p>
<p>10. Sample Turnaround Time:</p>
<p>The Contractor will be expected to report the results of each sample set within an average sample turnaround time of 20 calendar days.</p>
<p>11. Communication.</p>
<p>Communication between the COTR and the Contractor is necessary to allow the contract to proceed. The contractor is expected to use electronic mail, telephone, and the Internet for day to day contract information exchanges.</p>
<p>12. Sample Set Cost Accounting:</p>
<p>The contractor shall also provide monthly reports of cost information. The costs shall be broken out by sample set, project, and NIOSH Division.</p>
<p>13. Section 508 Compliance.</p>
<p>In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to people with disabilities. The Contractor will work with the CDC/NIOSH 508 Compliance Officer to fulfill these requirements and follow all reporting requirements.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated period of performance</span></strong>. Base of one (1) year with four (4), one (1) year options.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Other important considerations. </strong></span></p>
<p>Must be American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) accredited.</p>
<p>The Contactor must have a laboratory within the continental U.S. that can perform analysis within specified time limits to meet sample stability requirements stated in the NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods (NMAM) and other standard reference methods (e.g., OSHA, EPA, ASTM).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capability statement /information sought.<br /></span></strong><br />Respondents who believe that they possess the expertise and experience to meet the government's needs as described above are invited to submit technical and management capabilities addressing those requirements. These may include but are not limited to: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.</p>

<DESC>On behalf of The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee), the independent Federal agency that administers the AbilityOne Program, NISH, a designated central nonprofit is pursuing a potential partnership with commercial manufacturers of Deep Fry Oils and Liquid Shortenings for the purpose of providing employment opportunities for people who are blind or severely disabled. If successful, the result will be a Co-Branding Agreement between the manufacturer and the AbilityOne Program, and its registered brands. The ultimate expectation is that the co-branded product will be placed on the Committee's Procurement List (PL).
<p>The manufacturers will be nationally recognized suppliers of deep fry oils and liquid shortenings, and will supply a NISH food producing non-profit agency, located in Middletown, NY, who will Package, Pack, Label, Mark, Unitize and Distribute 100% of the annual requirement of these fry oils and liquid shortenings to all four branches of the U.S. Military and other Federal Customers, through the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Prime Vendor Program (PVP). The Non-profit agency will provide world-wide distribution to CONUS and OCONUS locations.</p>
<p>The fry oils and liquid shortenings must be commercial, nationally recognized brands that meet and/or exceed Federal Government and Industry published standards.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the following criteria must be met:</p>
<p>1. Possession of a nationally known brand name that can be demonstrated to have significant appeal through evidence of substantial sales.<br /><br />2. U.S. manufacturer of commercial-off-the-shelf fry oils and liquid shortenings (Canola, Vegetable, and Soy). Future oils may include but are not limited to corn, cottonseed, peanut, and sesame oils (additional, future oils types are not guaranteed). Interested manufacturers do not need to supply all oil types. However, preference may be given to manufacturers of all oil types (Canola, Vegetable, and Soy). Additionally, the selection of at least two manufacturers is preferred.</p>
<p>3. This product must meet industry specifications and standards for performance.</p>
<p>4. The chosen manufacturers must be willing to set a high priority for delivering the oils to the Non-profit Agency in order to assure on-time deliveries to the U.S. Military through the DLA Troop Support PVP. In the event of Surge or Full Scale Mobilization the oil suppliers must be willing to provide up to 300% of the annual requirement of fry oils and liquid shortenings. The estimated annual requirement for liquid shortenings (vegetable, soy, and canola) is 543,530 cases. The estimated annual requirement for the fry oils (vegetable, soy, and canola) is 207,113 cases.</p>

<DESC>This project consists of the construction and upgrading of the existing Biazzi Plant, which is
considered a specialty chemical process plant. Project construction will include; new buildings,
chemical tanks, containment structures, connection of specialty alloy piping via pharmaceutical
grade welding, distributed control systems, and other supporting equipment and facilities. The
project scope will also include upgrades to storage and delivery facilities for chemical and raw
materials, product manufacturing, handling, transfer facilities, and waste treatment facilities.
Once the Agile Chemical Facility is completed and has proven its production capabilities,
decontamination and demolition of several of the Biazzi Plant buildings and all of the Moser
Plant buildings will be required.

P-162 will include new construction of six buildings with a total area of 773m2 (8,321 SF),
renovation of four buildings with a total area of 464m2 (4,997 SF), and demolition of thirty-nine
buildings with a total area of 2,220m2 (23,893 SF).
 Installation of $3.9M of specialty
Government Furnished Equipment will also be a requirement of the project.

The project design is extremely complex in regards to piping, instrumentation, equipment,
programming, controls, and lightning protection. The A/E is utilizing SmartPlant, a 3D plant
modeling software to improve design, execution, hand over, and plant operational efficiency. It
is of value to the Government that sources have key experience with 3D plant modeling
software, specifically SmartPlant.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is seeking existing passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology/hardware that can be utilized as a navigation aid in an underwater environment.  NSWCCD is particularly interested in identifying passive RFID reader/tag technology to achieve integrated, real time or near real time, repeatable position location, orientation, coverage and obstacle avoidance capability while traversing an underwater surface using an ROV, crawler or other technology operated for prolonged periods of time (weeks or months) in a pier-side harbor environment.  Detection must be sufficiently distinct and rapid to enable use by the host technology as part of an intrinsic hardware capability or as part of on-board software based processing and utilization capability.

The targeted RFID technology must be designed to accommodate the challenges of the operating environment, including: vehicle and surface mounting (adequately small size, amenable geometry, insignificant profile, resistance to vibration and noise, etc.), powering (under 30 watts desired) and other realities that include attachment and operation on steel and aluminum substrates, coverage by marine paint coatings (multiple layers to 25-40 mils thick) that may have metal oxide antifouling material in their formulation, coverage by bio-fouling growth, and being subjected to periodic cleaning with brushes or other applied fouling removal technology.
    

The principal recipients of the new technology are the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division, and the Navys Office of Naval Research (ONR) 332.

To accomplish their designated work functions, the hardware (RFID reader and tags) must have a baseline set of data from laboratory evaluation/field testing to indicate that the combined hardware/system is a viable option for the desired underwater requirements.                        

NSWCCD is not interested in technologies that are currently used for underwater navigation such as: acoustic tracking systems that utilize long baseline (LBL), short baseline (SBL), or ultra-short baseline (USBL) systems, Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) technology with signal processing logic, or imaging systems that that use light or acoustic based imaging techniques/software.
  These methods of underwater navigation will not be considered for this subject application.  Only passive RFID technology that can meet form, fit and functional requirements in the intended environment will be considered.

Organizations should provide information regarding projected capabilities on metallic surfaces in a saltwater environment, system descriptions, conceptual drawings, and any needed vehicle interface requirements.  Upon successful informational gathering, the proposed  RFID reader/tag technology could lead to further demonstration efforts. 

The information provided shall not exceed to pages, and should be submitted to the following address or email by 31 January 2011:

Two of these alternatives necessitate dredging and earthwork activities.   The Corps is hosting a pre-solicitation conference to discuss feasibility and industry capability.  <BR><BR>One alternative currently being evaluated includes dredging within the North Fork of the Toutle River upstream of the Corps' Sediment Retention Structure (SRS) and within the formed sediment plain created by the structure.  The intent of this alternative is to utilize a combination of hydraulic and mechanical means to relocate up 3 to 4 million cubic yards (MCY) annually over a twenty-five year period within the boundary of the existing sediment plain for the purpose of inducing deposition and creating additional sediment storage above the SRS.  An in-water work period of 4.5 months is assumed for this feasibility study. <BR><BR>The second dredging alternative encompasses the removal of approximately 45 MCY of material from the Cowlitz River over a twenty-five year period on a triannual schedule.    Dredging would occur along a majority of the river from the confluence of the mouth at the Columbia River to the confluence with the Toutle River, approximately 20 river miles.  An in-water work period of four (4) months is assumed for this feasibility study.  It is also assumed that dredge material will be placed at numerous upland sites near or adjacent to the Cowlitz River.   Varying degrees of site preparation and mechanical placement of the dredge materials will be required at the fill sites. <BR>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<CONTACT>Munira Mwalimu, Contracting Officer, Phone 2023576906, Fax 2023576945, Email Munira.Mwalimu@ed.gov
<DESC>The National Assessment Governing Board has developed a new framework for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) writing assessment which calls for an entirely computer-based administration of the assessment in 2011 for grades 8 and 12 and in 2013 for grade 4. Preliminary achievement levels descriptions were developed as part of the Writing 2011 Framework development project.
<p><br />The Governing Board requires expert evaluation of the preliminary descriptions, as well as a review of the achievement levels descriptions currently used for reporting writing NAEP results in order to develop final descriptions to use in the achievement levels setting process. The new achievement levels descriptions will be presented to the Governing Board for adoption in May 2011 as the achievement levels descriptions to be used for reporting results of the writing NAEP for 2011 and thereafter.</p>
<p>The overall objective of the procurement is to develop achievement levels descriptions to be used for reporting the results of the 2011 NAEP for grades 8 and 12 and the 2013 NAEP for grade 4. The Statement of Objectives requires offerors to propose a methodology and procedure for developing the achievement levels descriptions. The procedure must at minimum include a plan to draft the achievement levels descriptions, a plan to submit them to broad-based review, vetting by various stakeholders of NAEP and writing, revisions in response to the reviews, and finalizing the descriptions for submission to the Governing Board for approval.</p>
<p>Clarification questions on the RFP are due no later than close of business on January 11, 2011. Proposals are due on February 7, 2011, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</p>
<p>Phone call inquiries on the RFP will not be accepted. Please address all correspondence via email or fax.</p>

Licensure.  <BR>Any contract service provider (i.e., Radiologist) that is proposed to interpret/diagnose films under any contract resulting from this solicitation shall have and maintain a current, active, valid, and unrestricted license to practice medicine in the State, District of Columbia, or the territory of the United States where the images are read in addition to a current, active, valid, and unrestricted Texas license, if the reading location is other than Texas.  If the contract service provider is located in Texas and will read films in Texas, a Texas license only is sufficient.<BR><BR>2. Technical.  <BR>	Sub-factors:<BR>	2A. Radiologists' Credentials.  <BR>	2B. Experience.<BR>	2C. Quality Control Plan.<BR><BR>3. Past Performance.<BR><BR>4. Price.  <BR>Price will be evaluated using various price analysis techniques and procedures, including, but not limited to, comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation, comparison of proposed prices with the Independent Government Estimate, as well as any other pricing information available to the Government to establish fair and reasonable pricing and a balanced offer. <BR><BR>See Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 for instructions of the above factors.<BR><BR>Factor 1 is equal in importance to Factor 2.  The sub-factors within Factor 2 (2A, 2B, and 2C above) are equal in importance to each other.  Factors 1 and 2, when combined, are more important than Factor 3.  Factors 1, 2, and 3, when combined, are significantly more important than Factor 4.  <BR><BR>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<BR><BR>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>(End of provision)<BR><BR>Addendum to 52.212-2<BR><BR>Award will be made using the best value trade-off source selection process.  Award will be made on the basis of the best value offered to the Government of proposals meeting or exceeding the satisfactory standards for the non-cost factors.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, is deemed acceptable to the Government, and whose proposal offers the best value to the Government all factors considered.<BR><BR>It is contemplated that award will be made without discussions with offerors (except communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification).  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary.   If the Government enters into discussions, a competitive range will be established based on the evaluated price and other evaluation factors included in the solicitation.  The Government will limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<BR><BR>Proposal Ratings:<BR><BR>An offeror must "pass" Factor 1 before  being considered further under Factors 2, 3, and 4.  That is, if an offeror does not present Texas-licensed radiologist(s) in their proposal, their proposal will "fail" and shall not be considered under each of the remaining factors, and thus be ineligible for award.  Further, an offeror must receive a rating of at least satisfactory in each of Factors 2 and 3, and at least satisfactory in each of the sub-factors under Factor 2, in order to be considered for award.  <BR><BR>1. Ratings of an offeror's proposal reflect the Government's confidence in each offeror's ability, as demonstrated in its proposal, to perform the requirements stated in the solicitation.  The following rating scheme for Technical (Factor 2 and sub-factors) will be used: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory.  The rating scheme is defined below:<BR><BR><BR>ADJECTIVE	DEFINITION AND CRITERIA <BR><BR>Excellent 	The proposal demonstrates a superior understanding of the requirements and a new or proven approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has several exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the government.  The proposal has no weaknesses or deficiencies.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will be sufficient to minimize risk.  The proposal is extensive, detailed, and exceeds all requirements and objectives; therefore, has a high probability of meeting the requirements with little or no risk to the government.  Risk Level: Very Low. <BR><BR>Good 	The proposal demonstrates a considerable understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the government.  The proposal has no deficiencies and any proposal weakness has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  The proposal generally exceeds requirements in minor areas; therefore, has a strong probability of meeting the requirements with little risk to the government.  Risk Level:  Low. <BR><BR>Satisfactory	The proposal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements and the approach meets all performance or capability standards.  The proposal has no strengths that exceed the requirement.  The proposal has no material weaknesses and no deficiencies.  The proposal has some weakness that can potentially cause disruption of schedules, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Special contractor emphasis and close government monitoring will minimize any risk.  The proposal meets the minimum requirements; therefore, has an acceptable probability of successfully meeting the requirements. Risk Level:  Low.<BR><BR>Marginal 	The proposal fails to meet performance requirements and capability standards in one or more areas.  The proposal has minor omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions without a complete revision of the entire proposal.  The proposal has weaknesses or minor deficiencies that can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis, and close government monitoring.  <BR>Risk Level: Moderate.  <BR><BR>Unsatisfactory 	The proposal fails to demonstrate a basic understanding of the requirements and the approach fails to meet performance or capability standards.  The proposal has major omissions, weaknesses or deficiencies, and inadequate details to assure the evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of the requirements.  The proposal presents an unacceptable risk and cannot meet the requirements without major revisions.  Risk Level:   High. <BR><BR><BR>2. Performance risk is defined as "ratings that assess the risks associated with each offeror's likelihood of success in performing the requirements stated in the solicitation based on the offeror's performance record on similar contract efforts.  The following rating scheme for Performance Risk will be used:  Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal, Unsatisfactory and Neutral.<BR><BR><BR><BR>ADJECTIVE	DEFINITION AND CRITERIA<BR><BR>Excellent	Overall performance exceeds contractual requirements and gives extra benefits to the customer.  Problems, if any, were promptly corrected without negative impact to the customer.  Risk level: Very  Low.<BR><BR>Satisfactory	Performance meets contractual requirements, but does not exceed them.  The contractual performance contains some minor problems for which corrective actions were taken by the contractor were satisfactory.  Risk Level:  Low.<BR><BR>Marginal	Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractor's proposed actions to correct any problems were only marginally effective, or were not fully implemented.  Risk Level:  Moderate.  <BR><BR>Unsatisfactory	Performance does not meet most (or all) contractual requirements.  The contractual performance contains serious problems for which the contractor's actions were ineffective.  Risk Level:  High.<BR><BR>Neutral	If an offeror has no experience in providing teleradiology services, the offeror shall be rated as "Unknown."  The offeror has little/no relevant past performance upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Risk Level: Unknown.<BR><BR> <BR>3.  All offers must receive a rating of at least at satisfactory, in all areas, in order to be considered eligible for award.<BR>(End of addendum to 52.212-2)<BR><BR>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items Alt I.

<p>9.2 Quality Assurance Provisions:</p>
<p>9.2.1 Compliance:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that delivered tasks meet all standards and guidelines provided in this <br />contract and in applicable regulations and directives.</p>
<p>9.2.2 Acceptance:</p>
<p>A Coast Guard Representative will review the Customer Satisfaction Surveys and provide feedback to <br />the contractor.</p>
<p><br />Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition <br />Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3, HSAR 3006.3, HSAM 3006.3, CGAP 1206.3, and in accordance with (IAW) requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.302-1 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows: <br />1) Agency and Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>The US Coast Guard, Command, Control and Communication Engineering Center (C3CEN), proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition. <br />2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved:</p>
<p>The USCG intends to sole-source its requirement due the specific nature of the Training for a single piece of equipment. The Training is designed to give firsthand knowledge to C3CEN instructors for the NMS 6000 produced by L3 Dynamic Positioning and Control Systems. The NMS 6000 is a Dynamic Positioning System (DPS) being installed on USCG Buoy Tenders, and the Buoy Tender Labs and classroom in C3CEN. A third (10 of 30) of USCG's Buoy Tenders and the WLB Lab in C3CEN already have the NMS 6000 installed. Currently, C3CEN Instructors for Buoy Tenders are not certified to use or train others in the use of the NMS 6000. The 3 day Training session for 8 Students is to take place at USCG C3CEN Portsmouth Va. 23703</p>
<p>3) Description of Services and Estimated cost:</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition consists of the following: <br />Instructor Rate and onsite prep: <br />Estimated Travel Expenses: <br />USCG Train the Trainer NMS 6000: <br />Estimated cost: $24,000</p>
<p>4) Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: <br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii) entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." <br />5) Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:</p>
<p>The cost of having a third party develop and implement this training would be prohibitive, necessitating the need to have the original equipment manufacturer perform the work. L3 is the only known source that can provide this specific Training.<br />6) Description of Efforts Made to Ensure Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Practicable:</p>
<p>Market research was conducted 15-16 December 2010 to determine if any other commercial off-the-shelf training program could be used to train C3CEN instructors. Due to the product specific nature of the NMS 6000 no other source was identified or could be deemed suitable for use to train C3CEN instructors. A Solicitation is to be posted on Fed-Biz-Ops with verbiage that any offerors that can provide the services as stated may provide a cost proposal and all proposals would be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:</p>
<p>Fairness of price is based on quotes given by L3 Dynamic Positioning and control Systems. The Market Research pricing information provided by L3, is the same cost that the General Public would pay for the same Training if acquired.</p>
<p>8) Description of Market Research:</p>
<p>Market research was conducted 15-16 December 2010 to determine if other commercial off-the-shelf training programs could be used to perform the required training. Due to the product specific nature of the NMS 6000 no other source was identified or could be deemed suitable for use to train C3CEN instructors.<br /><br />9) Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />There are no other facts to provide. <br />10) A Listing of the Sources, if Any, That Expressed, in Writing, An Interest in the Acquisition: <br />No other interest has been expressed at this time. <br />11) A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required:</p>
<p>There no actions that can be taken.12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. The anticipated cost to the Government is determined to be fair and reasonable. <br />12) I certify this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br />LTJG Eric G. Eng, <br />Technical Representative <br />James A. Lassiter <br />USCG, Contracting Officer</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

**APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. 
Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.
 With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire.
 The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx . Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM , respectively.

<p><br />SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE<br />In accordance with FAR 39.2, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is implemented in this order. Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.hhs.gov/od.</p>
<p>Section 508 Acceptance Criteria <br />Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed GPAT, VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.</p>
<p>The "Annotated Dr. Martin M. Cummings' Digital Manuscript Collection" delivered as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility. The "Annotated Dr. Martin M. Cummings' Digital Manuscript Collection" delivered must include a completed GPAT, a template of which is included as a part of this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has determined that Cheryl Rae Dee, Ph.D., is uniquely qualified to meet NLM's needs for the project of organizing and preparing for digitization the papers of the former Library Director, Dr. Martin M. Cummings. While other vendors could perform the technical work associated with the project, the proposed Contractor has had the most extensive experience with the Cumming's papers and has broad-based knowledge of NLM and its programmatic history during the years from 1964-1984 when Cummings was Director. Through previous related work, Dr. Dee has demonstrated she can perform the assignment in an effective and timely manner even while adjusting to last minute changes in Dr. Cummings' availability. This is especially critical to the successful completion of this project as Dr. Cummings' age and physical condition require a Contractor who can adjust to Dr. Cummings' schedule and physical stamina. Most importantly, Dr. Dee has built up a unique rapport with Dr. Cummings and he has developed a substantial comfort level with her.</p>
<p>While the relationship of trust is critical, the Contractor must also possess a strong knowledge of the history of Dr. Cummings' years as NLM Director and must have extensive familiarity with the source material to be organized and digitized. In addition to the unique capabilities of the Contractor, the requirement must be initiated and completed quickly as the Library intends to make much of the digitized material accessible in 2011, when it celebrates its 175th anniversary. In summary, Dr. Dee possesses the exact degree of technical and operational skills necessary to accomplish the specific goals and outcomes in a timely and effective manner. Any efforts to identify the required skills and expertise through other sources would pose additional undo costs to the government. Therefore, in the best interest of the government this purchase order should be awarded to Cheryl Rae Dee, Ph.D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is a RFQ available; however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the referenced service as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received electronically at the Government infrastructure by 4:00 PM EST on Friday, January 7, 2011. Proposals must include pricing information and should reference Synopsis No. NLM-11-034/SRE and should be submitted to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov. Inquiries regarding this procurement shall be submitted electronically to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov and shall be received by 12:00 PM EST on Thursday, December 30, 2010.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">QUESTION: What types of databases are you using to input and store project data?</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">&nbsp;</span><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">ANSWER: <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">The Agency uses a number of sophisticated relational databases (4<sup>th</sup> Dimension and Access) as well as Excel to store, analyze and report information about agency projects.&nbsp; The relational databases have the ability to store both narrative text fields as well as shorter fields for names, quantitative information etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We often provide reports that combine a variety of longer text fields with quantitative and other brief information.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">QUESTION: Will there be someone from USTDA willing to train the chosen contractor on databases?&nbsp; If not, do you have ample manuals for chosen contractor's to review and obtain acclamation?</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">ANSWER: <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">We have found that as long as the applicants have a reasonable understanding and ability to use computer software such as Excel, it is easy for us to teach the new contractors what they need to know within a matter of hours or days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, we spend a good deal of time with new contractors during the first day or two showing them the source of information and where to input it in the database.&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, they are ready to function on their own (with, of course, some monitoring and checking) within two days.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">QUESTION: Could you please clearly define the term "project"?&nbsp; Are evaluation projects used to describe USTDA programmatic actions within agency missions performed by USTDA employees; or, is the term "loosely" being used to describe contracts awarded by the USTDA procurement office to be managed and administered by USTDA contracting personnel?</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">ANSWER: <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">From the evaluation office's point of view, we focus on a U.S. TDA project that involves a feasibility study, technical assistance, an orientation visit (or reverse trade mission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic data (USTDA obligation, name of contractor, name of foreign grantee etc.) are already in the official agency database.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluation then writes a project description, puts in contact information, size of the U.S. TDA contractor etc. into the database.&nbsp; This is baseline information that is then used later by USTDA evaluators in making an assessment of project results.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">QUESTION: Could you please clearly define the words "cost sharing" as stated on page 4 in the "perspective" section.&nbsp; Are you describing "cost sharing" from a contractual perspective in terms of a cost type contract as described in the Federal Acquisition Regulations within FAR Part 16.&nbsp; Or, are you speaking of cost sharing objectives in terms of interagency agreements; or cost sharing activity between USTDA program offices or all the aforementioned?</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">ANSWER: <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">USTDA often seeks "cost sharing" of the activities in which the agency is involved from U.S. companies, from host country grantees and in some cases from other USG entities.&nbsp; Our database allows us to estimate the total cost of the activity being undertaken and then break it down among the various entities that are sharing the costs.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">QUESTION: Do you have a period of performance date(s) in mind for this project?</span></p>

QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AFTER 18 JAN 2011 at 1100 hours. This is to ensure a fair solicitation process to all potential contractors.

<DESC>Q&A<BR><BR>1)      The SSN provides a section called "SYSTEM DESCRIPTION and SYSTEM<BR>REQUIREMENTS".  Is the "SYSTEM DESCRIPTION" section provided just for general background of existing system operation?  Or, is a proposed solution expected to either include or interface to the different elements identified in the SYSTEM DESCRIPTION such as Smart Adapter and ICM?<BR><BR>Answer: The system description provides background for the current EMD configuration.  The proposed solution should address of all of the information requested in the sources sought.<BR><BR><BR><BR>2)      Please provide a block diagram of the current MSCCS solution showing<BR>the interconnections among the system components and the external systems including the VIC-3 intercom and the Mounted Soldier Display System (MSDS) as<BR>described in the Sources Sought announcement.  Based on the description<BR>provided, a block diagram would help clarify.<BR><BR><BR>Answer:  The Government will not provide any technical data other than what was provided in the RFI.  Should this action result in a competitive solicitation, it will most likely be procured via a performance specification.<BR><BR><BR><BR>3)      ICM Questions<BR><BR>a.       Can you fully describe the functionality of the ICM?<BR><BR>Answer:  The current configuration ICM provides for channel, volume and push-to-talk switching.  Additionally it provides the capability to detect when the soldier becomes disconnected from the intercom.  When un-tethered, the ICM will signal the JEM to transmit and provides power from the radio battery to the headset.  The ICM also controls the Display Subsystem (brightness, video display selection).<BR><BR>b.      What are the connectors, pinouts and protocols of the ICM if we are<BR>expected to interface to this device?<BR><BR>Answer: Government will not provide any technical data other than what was provided in the RFI.  Should this action result in a competitive solicitation, it will most likely be procured via a performance specification.<BR><BR>c.       Does the ICM control the FFCS when tethered or does it only control<BR>the wearable communication System ensemble?<BR><BR>Answer: No.  The ICM does not control the FFCS.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>d.      What are the ICM requirements relative to the display system?<BR><BR>Answer: When tethered, the current configuration ICM controls the Display Subsystem (brightness, video display selection).<BR><BR><BR>4)      Smart Adapter Questions<BR><BR>a.       What are the components of the Smart Adapter?  Does it include all<BR>the interface cabling as well as the control box?<BR><BR><BR>Answer: Government will not provide any technical data other than what was provided in the RFI.  Should this action result in a competitive solicitation, it will most likely be procured via a performance specification.<BR><BR><BR>b.      Is the Smart Adapter needed for both ICM and non-ICM configurations?<BR>Or, does an ICM eliminate the need for a Smart Adapter altogether?<BR><BR>Answer: Under the current configuration, the ICM potentially reduces the total number of Controllers required.  Depending on use, the current configuration ICM can be used in lieu of the Smart Adapter and DCM.<BR><BR>c.       What are the connectors, pinouts and protocols of the Smart Adapter<BR>if we are expected to interface to the  device?<BR><BR><BR>Answer: Government will not provide any technical data other than what was provided in the RFI.  Should this action result in a competitive solicitation, it will most likely be procured via a performance specification.  The system description provides background for the current EMD configuration.  The proposed solution should address of all of the information requested in the sources sought.<BR><BR><BR>d.      Does the Smart Adapter control the FFCS when tethered or does it only<BR>control the wearable communication System ensemble?<BR><BR> Answer: The current configuration Smart adapter does not control the FFCS.<BR><BR>5)      Is the Band Pass Filter required to be included as part of the overall<BR>system solution?  If so, what are the filter characteristics?<BR><BR><BR>Answer: A band pass filter may/may not be required depending on the proposed solution.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>6)      The system description discusses a number of different cables (Vehicle<BR>Intercom cable, Antenna cable, BPF cable).  Are we to quote A-Kits including cables?<BR><BR>Answer: No.  This solicitation is for B-Kit production only.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>This notice is modification #2 to the previously posted Sources Sought Synopsis(SSS) NNJ10ZBG001L.  The purpose of this modification is to expand the systems'stechnical requirements.   NASA/JSC is hereby requesting information about potential sources for a bi-directionalcommunications system between the International Space Stations (ISS) United StatesOn-Orbit Segment and Visiting Vehicles (VVs).  The ISS Common Communications for Visiting Vehicles (C2V2) system includes the following:	multiple antennas (without gimbals) that will be located externally on the ISS toprovide coverage for planned VV approaches for berthing or docking at designated dockingports;	low-noise amplifiers and associated electronics may be required on the ISS toensure adequate receive signal strength at radio location due to potentially long cableruns with associated losses between the antennas and the radios; and	two-way communications equipment including diplexers, combiners, radios, basebandsignal processors, Decryption/Encryption Devices (DEDs), and ISS and VV interfacehardware and software. The C2V2 system will reside on the ISS and the VVs.  The C2V2 system delivered to the VVswill not include the antennas or any associated antenna electronics or any ISS uniqueinterfaces; thus, ensuring the minimum equipment delivery to the VV to reduce VV size,weight, and complexity to the maximum extent possible.General technical requirements for the C2V2 system include:1.	S-band or Ultra High Frequency (UHF);2.	support approximately 10 kbps at a range of ~30 km and a minimum of ~74 kbps at~10 km with a bit error rate of 10-5 and a positive link margin; 3.	a spread spectrum radio;4.	conformance to National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)requirements for operation in low earth orbit; 5.	encryption/decryption of data in both directions;6.	processing for control of the C2V2 system, output of C2V2 health and status, andtransmission of the telemetry data;7.	for C2V2 equipment residing on the ISS, the following interfaces are required:		a 1553A/B interface to the ISS for critical data transfer and command and controlof the C2V2;	a separate control interface for sending time critical commands to unmanned VVsduring rendezvous and proximity operations;	Ethernet interfaces for hardline communications with up to four docked VVs andfor ISS non-critical data transfer; and	120 VDC power interface; 8.	for C2V2 equipment residing on the VV, the following interfaces are required: 	a RS-422 or other standard interface(s) to the VV for telemetry transfers,command and control of the C2V2 equipment residing on the VV, and C2V2 equipment healthand status output to the VV; and	28 VDC power interface;9.	a 15-year operating life for equipment residing on the ISS (VV operating liferequirements are less stringent);  10.	one fault tolerance; and11.	certified flight system delivery goal of July 2013 with functional equivalentunits delivered nine months earlier.The C2V2 system should be based on off-the-shelf hardware and software with provenperformance and reliability.  Innovative solutions that meet the fundamental need ofproviding reliable two-way communications at the required minimum bit rate, but that mayresult in some deviations to the aforementioned requirements, are encouraged and shouldbe brought forward for discussion.  Use of a modular architecture that allows for removalof the DED during the majority of ground testing and for separate delivery of the radioand DED to the VVs is highly desirable.  In addition to delivery of flight-certifiedhardware and software, functional equivalent hardware and software is also required forintegrated test in ISS and VV test facilities.The overall North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for thisprospective procurement is 336419 and the small business size standard is 1,000employees.No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about the&nbsp;second quarter of FY 2011 (January - March) for an anticipated five-year cost plus fixed-fee award.&nbsp; The award of this effort will be based on an evaluation for a USAID/Colombia Consolidation and Enhanced Livelihoods Initiative Northern Region (CELI-Northern).<br /><br />The proposed contract will assist the Government of Colombia (GOC) to establish State presence in stragecially-critical municipalities located in the Nudo de Paramillo-a region that straddles southern Cordoba and Northern Anitoquia (also known as Bajo Cauca Antiqueno). Both of these Regional Coordination Centers have defined a strategy based on the following lines of work: 1) security and justice, 2) social development 3) economic growth 4) institutional development 5) access to property and 6) communications (roads, electricity, and cell-phone).&nbsp; The other principal region is Catatumbo (northern Norte de Santander).&nbsp; Once the GOC has guaranteed a minimum level of permanent security for target communities, the CELI contractor will supprort the GOC's efforts to utilize an integrated approach for consolidating peace, security and development gains which will require a robust effort to create thousands of licit economic opportunities, to strengthen and link public and private organizations, to promote citizen participation, and to support institutional strengthening at the municipal and departmental levels to ensure good governance and improve local service delivery.&nbsp; In transition zones where the GOC has only recently established minimum security, the contractor will emphasize immediate, short-term activities to meet urgent economic and social needs with the goal of demonstrating the presence of the State and to help the target areas recover quickly from the effects of the conflict and eradication.&nbsp; Small, quick-impact projects will help to create confidence in the GOC, provide the opportunity to build relations between communities and local government, and respond to local dynamics and urgent needs.&nbsp; In areas where security is better established, the contractor will support longer-term interventions in coordination with the government, private sector and civil society with a particular emphasis on accompaniment and the provision of technical assistance to permanently consolidate State presence.&nbsp; The CELI-Northern contractor will also coordinate closely with any ongoing USAID program in the area and will coordinate with the Public Policy program to implement pilot activities in collaboration with the public policy implementer to address policy constraints to consolidation of state presence.</p>

<DESC>This requirement is for Patient Appointing Services for Various Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) CONUS-wide for the Department of Army, Department of Air Force, and Department of Navy.  CHCC has awarded a Multiple Award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Contract for Non-Personal Services.  The contract period of performance will have a base year from 01 December 2010 through 30 November 2011, with four one-year option periods.  This requirement will augment the capability of the MTF staff to book health care appointments in the direct care system at MTFs for Military Health System (MHS) eligible beneficiaries.  The contractor shall provide all services necessary to make appointments and coordinate appointments with other direct care system facilities as required.  The Contractor shall be required to make outgoing appointment calls (i.e., cancellations, reschedule, warm transfer calls to clinics, etc.).  The Contractor will not make appointments with non-MTF (i.e. civilian network and/or non-network) providers or enter non-MTF (civilian network or non-network) information into the appointing system.  Appointments shall be made following MTF-provided appointing criteria and comply with MHS access to care standards as required by 32 CFR 199.17.  Appointments shall be made using only DoD approved standard appointment types, business rules, and appointment detail codes as detailed in the MHS Guide to Access Success.  This service includes, but is not limited to, verifying registration information in the appointment system, correcting and, when required, registering beneficiaries prior to making the appointment, making and canceling of patient appointments, and providing performance and management reports on the appointing process for MHS eligible beneficiaries.  While the Department of Defense has over 200 MTFs combined, use of a contractual vehicle by the MTFs is voluntary and it is anticipated that 18 MTFs will require services under this requirement.  The Contracting Officer is Ms. Dora A. Hernandez, (210) 295-4570, email dora.hernandez@amedd.army.mil.  The Contract Specialist is Ms. Yesenia C.
