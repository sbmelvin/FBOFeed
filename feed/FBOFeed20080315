<DESC>The Fish and Wildlife Service has a requirement for a 12 volt battery powered electroshock unit backpack with remote on/off breaker switch box and elasped time meter (in line anode style), Light open-frame design minimizes weight fatigue in the fieldýonly 25.5 lbs. for complete system with 18 amp-hr. battery (excluding anode and cathode). Even lighter with 12 amp-hr. battery. - Direct-dial controls permit quick setting changes and viewing of output voltage, current, and battery voltage. Separate optional elapsed time display. No scrolling through VCR-style menus and buttons to set up or view parameters. - Uses single 12 volt sealed lead acid battery, 12 or 18 amp-hr. Battery externally accessible to permit rapid field changing. Battery terminals are electrically isolated from output. - Non electrically-conductive enclosure, backpack frame and battery support bracket. - Capacitive pulse-discharge output, 200 watts average power, Peak voltage 250 V, peak current 10 amps. Capable of 30 Joules per pulse. Conductivity range 200 to 1300 uS. - Automatic output voltage control to maintain constant peak voltage with varying water conductivity and changes in pulse rate or duty cycle. - Selectable bursted pulse wavetrains (two pulses on/two pulses off, or three pulses on/one pulse off) for effective lamprey capture. - Two independent pulsing channels that can be accessed by a switch on the anode pole: Channel 1: Continuously variable rate selection from 1.0 to 10.0 pps with a resolution of 0.1 pps and accuracy of ý 5%; continuously variable duty cycle selection from 1 to 50% with a resolution of 1% and an accuracy of ý 2% absolute. Channel 2: Continuously variable rate selection from 10 to 1000 pps with a resolution of 1 pps and accuracy of ý 5%; continuously variable duty cycle selection from 1 to 50% with a resolution of 1% and an accuracy of ý 2% absolute. - Continuously variable peak voltage selection by direct reading dial from 0 to 250 V peak in two ranges (0-125 / 125-250). Resolution 1 volt, accuracy ý 5%. - Output voltage LED monitor (Front panel LED increases intensity with increased output voltage and duty cycle. At very slow pulse rates it flashes with every pulse verifying high voltage pulses are being delivered to output connectors. - Optional red LED on cathode pole lights up to indicate peak current through the water of 0.1 amp or higher. - Remote ON/OFF main power switch/breaker option which locates power switch in remote watertight box attached to lower part of backpack frame for easy access by operator. - Electrically isolated output. Tilt detectors with fast electronic shut-down for user protection. Additional water immersion detector shut-down for ývertical fallsý in water where user does not bend over far enough to trip tilt detector. - Digital LCD display that meters either peak output current, peak output voltage (rather than average values), or battery voltage (selectable by 3-position panel switch). - Built-in resettable LCD timer option to accumulate actual shocking time in minutes and seconds or all seconds (hour/hundreths of hour also available). Timer display is separate from metering display so both time and voltage or current are immediately viewable. - Electronic short-circuit, and over-current protection. Audible and visible fault identification for tilt/water immersion, over-current, and low battery conditions. - Alert tone during pulsing with variable volume control. Optional hi-intensity LED also available that lights during pulsing. - Modular construction for rapid field replacement of printed circuit board and inverter power mo that will be used to capture Sea Lamprey.
