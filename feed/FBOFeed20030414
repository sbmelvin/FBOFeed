The required demonstration is to clearly show the probe’s compliance to tight design requirement (e.g., 0.0002 accuracy) in measuring defects on the complex surfaces of a supplied thruster, in raster scan and 3-axis helix scan mode while using Windows-based software for data acquisition, analysis, and display using a dynamic color pallet.  Concurrent integration of data from a separately supplied eddy probe shall be demonstrated to show a capability to measure defect penetration through interior protective coating.   NASA/JSC intends to purchase the item from the Laser Techniques Company (LTC) in Bellevue, WA per FAR 6.302-1 (a)(ii), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Based on Market Research, it was concluded that no other company had the capabilities to produce such a product.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See notes 26 and 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time, April 25, 2003. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal in past performance rating, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts).  However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher past performance rating if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.	Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower past performance rating if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for the development and evaluation of Sensor Concepts for Ageless Aerospace Vehicles. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization - Telecommunications and Industrial Physics Division (CSIRO-TIP) who is the only known responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  CSIRO is the only known vendor that possesses the customized, one of a kind concept demonstrator required for this effort.  CSIRO-TIP's approach includes a unique coupling of remote bond strength sensing with advanced telecommunications technique.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to develop an acceptable approach and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 18, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for validation experiments and test results of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Power Generator in Martian Simulant Gas for Regenerative Aerobreaking. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase this research and development effort from Old Dominion University (ODU) who is the only known responsible source that can satisfy Agency requirements.  ODU has the only known physics laboratory that has a plasma generation system that allows for long run times so that parametric variations can be studied more thoroughly.  In addition the system has demonstrated that is can simulate low Mach plasma flows at Martian-like conditions. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 29, 2003.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for an oculometer (eye-tracking) system for the purpose of assessing pilot information acquisition with and distraction due to usage of the Aviation Weather Information (AWIN) systems in General Aviation flightdecks during actual flights as well as in simulation environments. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the ETS-PC oculometer on a sole source basis from Applied Science Laboratories (ASL).  The ETS-PC system is the only known system that can perform equally well under all lighting conditions - daytime bright sunlight as well as night darkness - and handles transitions between these extreme lighting conditions with very little, if any, operator intervention.  The ETS-PC's unique ability to work under these various lighting conditions is due to ASL's patented design technique.  Thus, ambient light conditions have minimal, if any, impact on the operation and eye measures made by the ETS-PC.  No other source is capable of satisfying the government's requirement. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 25, 2003.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for a contractor to hybridize NASA-GSFC provided detector arrays to silicon readout integrated circuits, and to perform functional electrical testing, as necessary. See uploaded Statement of Work/Specifications. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Rockwell Scientific Center (RSC), for the following reason(s): (1) Large format quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) arrays are to be developed. The formats are 1024 X 1024 (1K X 1K) elements, with the goal of building a 2048 X 2048 (2K X 2K) array. An outside vendor is needed to hybridize a readout integrated circuit (ROIC) with the detectors. Before a mask set for fabricating QWIPs can be designed, a ROIC vendor needs to be identified who has the required full well capacity, correct pitch, and low dark current. (2) The 1K and 2K ROICs manufactured by Rockwell Scientific Center meet the research requirements for the QWIP. RSC has the best performance in terms of cryogenic operations and full well charge capacity. Since RSC's arrays are fabricated with a design mask of 18 micron pitch for the 1K ROIC, any other ROIC for hybridization cannot be used. (3) Other vendors do not have the ROIC with the required cryogenic capability and the critical 18 microns detector pitch for 1K X 1K focal plane assemblies (FPAS) at an affordable cost to the Government. After careful evaluation of the TCM 8050 ROIC for low noise, low dark current, cryogenic capability and required pitch size for 1K X 1K arrays, it was decided that the RSC ROIC meets all of the above requirements.  The Authority for this sole-source requirement is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 28, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a procurement for comprehensive EVA Systems products and services.	These products and services include: 1) definition and integration of EVA requirements within and across Space Shuttle flights and International Space Station (ISS) increments, 2) EVA hardware systems sustaining engineering, including provisioning of EMU and EVA tools and crew aids, anomaly analysis and resolution, and real time mission support, 3) implementation of the Assured EMU Availability (AEA) and Life Extension Program for extension of certified EMU Life Support System (LSS) component life to 2020, 4) flight-to-flight processing and outfitting of EVA flight hardware systems and EVA training hardware systems, and 5) new EVA hardware systems design and development, and advanced EVA hardware systems technology development.  This contemplated effort includes the EVA portions of the following contracts: the EMU EVA contract (NAS 9-97150), the Space Flight Operations Contract - Flight Crew Equipment (SFOC-FCE) (NAS 9-20000), and the Science Engineering Analysis and Test (SEAT) contract (NAS 9-19100). NASA/JSC intends to acquire the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems products and services from Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International, Inc (HSSSI), on a noncompetitive basis.	In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) entitled “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements”, HSSSI has been determined to be the only company that possesses the unique capabilities necessary to accomplish the integrated acquisition.  The comprehensive EVA services and supplies to be included in this procurement have been deemed to be available only from the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) original source for the continued provision of highly specialized products and services.	Award to any other source will result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that will not be recovered through competition. This synopsis supersedes all other postings for the requirements identified in this synopsis, inclusive of 9-BH13-64-02-76P and any modifications to that posting.   During the next 4 to 5 years, when the agency must respond to the increased operational demands for EVA operations associated with ISS assembly and operations, coupled with decreasing budgets, NASA requires a comprehensive, integrated EVA Systems procurement that provides one NASA-to-contractor interface.  A direct relationship with the EMU Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is also required to preserve the essential accountability and responsiveness by the EMU OEM for certification of EVA systems flight readiness and real-time mission support.  This comprehensive, integrated procurement, resulting in one NASA-to-contractor interface, will yield substantial cost savings and improved efficiencies.  These savings and efficiencies will be achieved through the integration of EVA processes and facilities currently distributed across multiple contracts, and elimination of overlapping functions, workforces and skill mixes, contractor-to-contractor interfaces, and unproductive administrative and legal barriers.   The original EVA EMU requirements were procured utilizing full and open competition and the resulting contract was awarded to HSSSI.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), subsequent contracts were sole sourced to HSSSI in 1991 and 1997.  Design and development of EMU LSS test stands and test rigs took place utilizing HSSSI corporate assets.  Thirty-seven test stands and rigs necessary for the performance of this work are HSSSI capital equipment.  Additionally, to meet the EMU OEM requirements, HSSSI developed highly specialized manufacturing processes, process specifications, design and manufacturing notebooks, and detailed instructions, which are used for: 1) EMU LSS component manufacturing, assembly, disassembly, 2) EMU LSS component inspection, wear and tear assessment, test and refurbishment, and 3) EMU LSS integration into the EMU suit system.  HSSSI is the only contractor that possesses the above documentation.  The documentation is proprietary to HSSSI.	A full and open competition of all of the requirements for the EVA Systems contract, resulting in an award to a non-incumbent, would require that non-incumbent to gain all of the above unique capabilities of the incumbent through:  1) capture of incumbent personnel, 2) transition and certification of approximately 50 certified incumbent subcontracts/suppliers, and/or establishment and certification of new subcontracts/suppliers, 3) development and certification of EMU OEM processes and procedures, and 4) design, build and certification of EMU Government Support Equipment (GSE).  These processes, procedures, and capabilities are critical and essential elements in the successful performance of this scope of work.   In summary, a full and open competition for all of the EVA Systems requirements would require the transition of critical responsibilities to another contractor which would result in a significant increase in risk to mission assurance coupled with an extensive time requirement (estimated to be 3-years) to establish the essential elements for success explained above.  This would ultimately result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.	The Government could not expect to regain these costs through competition during the life expectancy of the EMU program.	The contract type chosen for this acquisition will be Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF).  The contract will be performance-based, with a small portion of the contract identified as IDIQ.  The Period of Performance for this effort is contemplated to be five years, including options. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. See note 22.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541691 and $6M, respectively. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.	Oral communications are acceptable, but shall not be considered formal. All formal responses to this posting shall only be submitted and accepted via e-mail. Interested organizations are encouraged to submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the entire effort, in writing, to the identified point of contact by 4:30 p.m. CST, on 04/28/03.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.	See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is soliciting proposals under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for innovative research and development projects to advance the capabilities of Counterterrorism and Forensic Science.  The BAA Proposal Information Packet is currently available and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Hard copies of the BAA document will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments, will also be distributed solely through the FBO site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This acquisition is being issued as BAA-0034104.  The FBI Laboratory is recognized as a world leader in the application of scientific methods to the examination of physical evidence in criminal investigations.  Since its inception in 1932, the FBI Laboratory has striven to enhance its services to the law enforcement and criminal justice communities through the research, development, and deployment of new or advanced forensic techniques and protocols.  The FBI Laboratory conducts research to develop new techniques of forensic analysis.  The FBI Laboratory must be in a position to provide prompt, accurate, and thorough responses to the thousands of requests it receives annually.  However, as the scientific, technical, and legal aspects of forensic science continue to become more complex, it has become increasingly challenging for the FBI to stay on the cutting edge of technology.  In order for the FBI Laboratory to continue to serve as the technical leader in the criminal justice community, it turns to outside expertise to address advanced forensic applications and initiatives.  A more detailed description of each area of interest and format of submissions is included in the Proposal Information Packet.  The Proposal Information Packet describes the process for proposal submission/evaluation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals or other solicitation with regard to this BAA, nor does the issuance of the BAA obligate the Government to fund any subsequently invited proposals nor pay any proposal preparation costs.  Although no portion of this announcement is set&#64979;aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) participation, the Government encourages applications from these institutions.  Proposals from all responsible sources capable of satisfying the Governments needs may be submitted and shall be considered.  This notice constitutes a BAA as authorized by FAR 6.102 (d) (2) (i).

The associated North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this requirement is 332322 with a size standard of 500 employees. The Government intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to General Kinetics Incorporated; 10688-D Crestwood Drive, Manassas, VA 20109 is the sole manufacture of this equipment.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is planning to study off-patent drugs for pediatric use information, based on the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act process.  Federal legislation and the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require that drugs be tested for safety and efficacy before they are approved for clinical use.  This testing must take place in all populations in which the drug will be used.  Since both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are different in immature individuals, and clinical efficacy and safety may not always be extrapolated from older patient populations to pediatric populations, studies must be conducted in the appropriate pediatric population before pediatric use information may be appropriately incorporated in the label.  The contracts will be awarded to entities that have expertise in conducting pediatric clinical trials, including qualified universities, hospitals, Contracts Research Organizations (CROs), federally funded networks (such as the Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit Network), and other public or private institutions.  The study sites will be called Pediatric Off-Patent Drugs Study (PODS) Centers.  Lead centers which subcontract to other clinical sites, pediatric clinical trials networks, CROs, and single academic centers are all eligible for contract awards depending on the overall qualifications, experience in drug trials in pediatrics, type of drug under study, specific drug indication and access to target pediatric populations.  It is expected that most studies will involve multiple sites.  Established pediatric drug trials networks or offerors that include multiple sites are encouraged to apply.  Offerors responding to the RFP are requested to develop study protocols involving the use of  sodium nitroprusside  in pediatric populations according to the specifications listed in the Statement of Work (SOW) in the RFP.  Sodium nitroprusside  is commonly used for  maintaining periods of hypotension during pediatric surgical procedures.  However, there is limited information available about dosing, pharmacokinetics, effectiveness and safety in pediatric patients who are maintained in states of controlled hypotension for either short or long periods.  In these clinical investigations, studies of safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships, and dosing in pediatric patients requiring long-term controlled hypotension will be conducted using randomized, observer-blinded approaches.  Investigators will recruit a broad spectrum of patients who require periods of controlled hypotension.  It is anticipated that 200 patients must complete the studies specified in the Statement of Work, including the FDA's Written Request.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990.  The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available on or about May 8,2003 at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  All responses must be submitted on or before August 10,2003 to:  Mrs. Mya N. Hlaing, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, 6100 Building, Suite 7A-07, 6100 EXECUTIVE Blvd., MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A-07, Rockville, Maryland 20852).  Fully electronic copies will not be accepted.  The referenced number to use for this announcement is: RFP-NICHD-2003-09.  All correspondence must cite the referenced number as provided.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI),  has a need to lease with the option to purchase an FEI Tecnai G2 Polara system with 2k x 2k CCD Camera and Gatan EFTEM system..  The acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR 13.5. The North American Industry Classification System code is 532490 and the business size standard is $6M.  Period of Performance:  Date of Acceptance through September 2003 with a two one-year option periods.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) and FAR Clause52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000) apply.  Background: Without this instrumentation, the required scientific research and techniques cannot be carried out.  The Tecnai G2 Polara provides improved specimen stability and specimen protection, and will significantly enhance capabilities for 1) structural determination of membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes at atomic resolution. 2) structural determination of macromolecular assemblies from single particle imaging studies. 3) Electron tomograghic studies to visualize the 3-dimensional architecture of cells at molecular resolution.  Recent advances in electron microscopy have made molecular imaging on this scale possible on specimens that are not easy to study with X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. High resolution molecular imaging holds the key to unlocking the answers to many seemingly intractable biological problems in cancer and HIV/AIDS research, including cell-cell interactions, ligand-receptor binding, intracellular signaling and virus-mediated fusion. Only a few high resolution molecular imaging facilities exist in the world and NCI offers the environment necessary to support such an effort, including expertise in crystallography, molecular modeling, computational biology, and membrane protein biochemistry.   The Government intends to trade-in an existing Tecnai F30 (TF30) Standard 300kV Field Emission Gun Electron Microscope with a computstage.   Requirements:  The Tecnai G2 Polara system shall be used for 1) Structural determination of membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes at atomic resolution, 2) Structural determination of macromolecular assemblies from single particle imaging studies, 3) Electron tomographic studies to visualize the 3-dimensional architecture of cells at molecular resolution and, 4) Contraction shall have all equipment installed and operational no later than June 1, 2003.  Solicitation:  The RFQ must be requested by electronic mail or facsimile only.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  Requests for the RFQ shall be made to the attention of Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax at 301-402-4513.  Requests shall include name of the contractor, DUNS number, telephone number, fax number, point of contact, business size standard, and identify the RFQ requested as RFQ-NCI-30035-NG.  The estimated issue date of the solicitation package is April 28, 2003 and the estimated due date is May 7, 2003.

SEGMENT OVERVIEW:  The DoD TC Space Segment is an element of the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA) and represents the TC MILSATCOM space and ground support segments (satellites, gateways, spacecraft control; and tracking, telemetry, and control) of this system.  The TCA space segment will consist of a DoD ring of satellites and an Intelligence Community (IC) ring of satellites that can operate independently and be interoperable.  The DoD ring constellation is currently visualized to operate both independently and integrated as a single backbone.  The DoD ring constellation is currently envisioned as protected, survivable geosynchronous Transformational Satellites (TSATs) that are fully crosslinked and hardened for the strategic mission.  They will provide EHF, X-band, Ka-band, and laser services to support military protected tactical, strategic, and Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AISR) users.  Highly Inclined Orbit (HIO) satellites will form the Advanced Polar System (APS) to support strategic and national users in the polar region.  The APS satellites are also hardened for the strategic mission, have EHF payloads, and use both RF and laser crosslinks to establish ring connectivity with the TSAT and AEHF constellations.  The DoD Space Segment includes the spacecraft control facilities and survivable ground assets (fixed and mobile).  Other key DoD TC elements not included in this procurement, but integral to the interface design are the Network interfaces between TSAT, APS and other parts of DoD's communications infrastructure (IC, Global Information Grid, AEHF, MUOS, Airborne Networks, and WGS). An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential Offerors.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential Offerors when an Offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman will communicate certain Offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels.  The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an Offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the Offeror.  The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition.  The Ombudsman is Dr. David W. Ganger, (310) 363-0588. DECLARATION: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This request is for planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes (RFQ), or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.

<DESC>Based on the Government Reference Architecture presented during the first MILSATCOM Transformational Communication Industry Days, held 5-7 March 2003, the Government requests from industry an estimate of software lines of code, down to the major modules, that would be part of the Network Management Acquisition.  The estimate should highlight both the code that has been developed already through legacy and commercial efforts and new lines of code that must be generated.  The Government also requests that industry provide a rough order of magnitude estimate of the cost of developing the envisioned Network Management System in yearly phasing, and provide supporting rationale.  The Government requests this data by 28 April 2003 to support ongoing acquisition planning.  The Industry Days charts are available at the following FedBizOps link: (http://www.eps.gov/spg/USAF/AFSC/SMCSMSC/Reference-Number-03-23/listing.html).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to procure on a sole source basis with Nico M. Temme, The Netherlands for expert mathematical writing, editing and consulting services for the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) from an expert contractor.  The acquisition includes the writing of one chapter and its integration into the whole DLMF.  This is a sole source procurement as the contractor was chosen by an exacting selection process, and is uniquely qualified to perform the tasks because of (1) his unique research accomplishments in the areas of mathematics that are relevant to Chapter NM, and (2) his general familiarity with the subject areas of the other DLMF chapters.  These attributes are critical, the first because each will cover the current state-of-the-art in its subject area in great detail, and the second because the whole DLMF will reflect the rich mathematical interconnections that exist among the subject areas of all the chapters.  A fixed  price purchase order will be issued 10 days or later from the date of this posting with a five month period of performance.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 561410 and the size standard is $5.0 mil.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, no later than the response date.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotation RFQ.  No RFQ is available.  See Note 26.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel:703-875-4357, Fax:703-875-4009, email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  Proposal Submission Place: Ing. Vladimir Gajdos, General Director, KH Tebis s.r.o.,Puskinska 641, 28401 Kutna Hora, Czech Republic, Phone: + 420-327-513-532, Fax: + 420-327-515-408.   The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a biomass to energy co-generation power plant.

KH Tebis plans to build and operate a central heat co-generation plant that uses biomass from municipal solid waste (MSW) as the feedstock.  The plant will be fueled by biogas created in anaerobic digesters from MSW and other biomass.  The proposed project will be composed of a bioreactor system, a micro-turbine, scrubbers, chillers, heat exchangers, and a control system.  The anaerobic digesters will generate biogas from MSW and other biomass materials.  The biogas will then be used to generate between 250 kW and 400 kW of electricity through use of a micro-turbine and between 400 kW and 800 kW of thermal energy. 

KH Tebis is a municipal heat utility that is owned by the Municipality of Kutna Hora and operates the Municipality’s heating plant. 

The objective of the feasibility study is to perform technical, environmental, economic and financial assessments of the project and to prepare a scope of work for the engineering, procurement, and construction of the project.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $160,900 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, May 23, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) intends to award on a sole source basis, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), to BAE Systems, Information and Electronic Systems Integration, Inc., Greenlawn, NY, an increase in quantity of approximately 200 units to the current FY-04 contract requirements for the AN/UPX-118 Common IFF Digital Transponder (CXP), including associated Remote Control Units and technical data.  The current CXP contract was previously awarded to BAE Systems through full and open competition.  Due to various changes in DoD budgets and aircraft installation schedules since initial contract award, the current FY04 option quantity on contract needs to be increased to meet current FY04 procurement plans;  however, the total quantity which is planned to be exercised under this competitively awarded contract remains below the quantity originally solicited and evaluated for the initial best value contract award.  Due to the non-recurring development, integration, platform testing and ILS costs already incurred for the CXP requirements through FY03, and planned to be incurred for the originally anticipated FY04 competitive quantities, there is no reasonable expectation that these costs would be recovered by competitive award of the additional 200 units required for FY04 to another source.  Further, procurement of the additional 200 units required for FY04 from another source would also result in unacceptable program and operational delays due to the added time which would be required for development, integration, platform testing and establishment of an ILS structure for a second source.  It should be noted, however, that NAVAIRSYSCOM is currently still planning for a competitive follow-on contract for FY05 and subsequent AN/UPX-118 requirements.   See Notes 22 and 26.

The SBA’s models are built using a variety of software programs including SAS, Access, and Excel. 

The SBA’s objective for this procurement is to ensure we have sufficient resources to meet the Office of the Chief Financial Officer’s goals per the statement of work posted on the eps.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

SECTION C:  White Paper Preparation Instructions

1.  General Instructions:  

a.  Offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision of FAR 52.215-1(e) Instructions to Offerors--Competitive Acquisition. Offerors should consider proposal instructions contained in the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry, which can be accessed on line at www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract. This guide was specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the PRDA/BAA proposal process. White Papers must be valid for 60 days and must reference the above announcement number.  Offerors must submit one original and three (3) copies of their White Papers.  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the government.  The cost of preparing White Papers in response to this PRDA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting or any other contract; however, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.

2.  White Papers:  		

a.  Page Limitation: 5 pages per advanced demonstrator (total of 15 pages), 10 pitch or larger, double spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches.  This limitation includes all information, e.g., indices, photographs, foldouts, appendices, attachments, etc.  It does not apply to the offeror’s proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW), which is limited to 6 pages (2 pages per demonstrator). The government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation. 

	b.  The White Papers shall include a discussion of the nature and scope of the technical approach.  As a separate Volume, which will be in addition to the White Paper page limitation, provide additional information on prior work in this area, descriptions of available equipment, data and facilities and resumes of personnel who will be participating in this effort.  This volume shall include a CSOW detailing the technical tasks proposed to be accomplished under the proposed effort and suitable for contract incorporation and a 1-page Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of cost.  Do not include any proprietary information in the SOW.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry referenced above to assist in SOW preparation. 

         c.  The evaluation of the White Papers shall consider technical aspects and cost factors as they relate to each demonstrator effort.  The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the relative merit of the technical approach proposed for each demonstrator in response to the announcement. The technical aspect ranks as the first order of priority and it shall be evaluated on the following criteria which are equal in order of importance:
 	  
(1)   (50%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor's Statement of Work (CSOW).    Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        
(2)   (50%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated. 
d. Any questions concerning the technical White Papers or SOW preparation shall be referred to the Contracting POC  cited above. 

SECTION D: Basis for Award:  This section shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror’s proposal (both technical oral presentation and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. While cost is a significant factor, the technical aspect, is ranked as the first order of priority and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are of descending importance:
      
1.  Technical:  

a.  (40%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW).  Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        

b.  (40%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated.  

c.  (20%) The offeror’s past experience with the technology, including personnel and related manufacturing facilities.
    
2.  Cost/Business Proposal:  This paragraph shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

          a.  COST/PRICE:  Separate the proposal into a business section and cost section. Adequate price competition is anticipated.  The business section should contain all business aspects to the proposed contractual or instrument arrangements, such as type of contract/instrument, any exceptions to terms and conditions of the model contract, any information not technically related, etc.  Provide rationale for exceptions. Cost proposals have no limitations; however, offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to 10 pages as a goal.  The proposal shall be furnished with supporting schedules and shall contain a person-hour breakdown per task.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry for detailed proposal instructions.  Offerors should provide a separate cost proposal for each advanced demonstrator and an overall cost proposal for the entire effort, if desired.  Offerors are reminded the effort has a 50:50 cost share approach.  The offeror should clearly show what portions of the effort will be funded by the Government and what portions will be funded by the offeror.  

b.  Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.  Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the second order of priority.  .  

c.  Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk will be individually assessed for the technical (oral presentation), cost and schedule areas. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. 

No other evaluation criteria will be used.  The oral and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time.  The Air Force reserves the right to select for award of a contract or assistance instrument any, all, part or none of the proposal received.  Award of a grant to universities or nonprofit institutions, or assistance instrument in lieu of a contract will be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties. The government also reserves the right to award any resulting contract pursuant to the Research and Development Standard Contract format in DFARS 235.70. 


SECTION E: OTHER INFORMATION TO OFFERORS:

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns only.  The acquisition is for drydock repairs to USCG 41 Foot Utility Boats (UTB) located in the Group Mobile area.  This contract will cover a base year and three options years, with approximately three boats repaired per year.  The estimated value of this procurement per year is under $100,000.  The NAICS Code is 336611.  The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.  The scope of this acquisition is for the drydocking and repairing of various items on the 41 foot boats.  The work will include, but is not limited to:  welding repairs; renewing hull seam welding; renewing aluminum frames, stiffeners, and brackets; renewing skeg; air testing skeg; renewing rubrail; removing and reinstalling rubrail; renewing rub rail fasteners; cleaning and inspecting diesel fuel tank; renewing cabin and pilot house; inspecting and preserving cabin top; removing and reinstalling cabin top windows; preserving cabin top interior; preserving cabin top exterior; renewing stern tube; removing and reinstalling main diesel engine; removing, inspecting and reinstalling propeller shaft; renewing strut; renewing propeller shaft coupling; performing minor repair and reconditioning of propeller; straightening shaft; realigning engine; renewing propulsion shaft stern tube bearings; renewing propulsion shaft strut bearings; removing and reinstalling propeller; renewing valves; removing, inspecting, and reinstalling rudder assembly; removing, inspecting, and reinstalling deck cleats; renewing rudder bushing; preserving main deck and well deck; preserving underwater body (Intersleek); preserving underwater body (epoxy); preserving freeboard; renewing engine room watertight hatch; renewing engine room watertight scuttle; providing temporary logistics, and routine drydocking.  All welding and brazing shall be accomplished by trained welders who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures.  The boats’ homeports are located within Group Mobile.  The U. S. Coast Guard may award two contracts for these repairs:  one for the western area of operations, and one for the eastern area of operations.  There are three boats in the western area of operations, which covers Pascagoula, MS, and Dauphin Island, AL.  The area covers a line bearing 180 degrees true from a point at 30-23.9N, 088-49W (Ocean Springs, MS) to the eastern tip of Deer Island, southward on a bearing of 171 degrees true to Dog Keys Pass LB1, and southeast on a bearing of 161 true to 200 NM offshore to the Highway 59 bridge (Gulf Shores, AL) out 180 degrees true to 200 NM offshore.  There are five boats in the eastern area of operations, which covers Pensacola, FL, to Panama City, FL.  The area covers the Highway 59 bridge out 180 degrees true to 200 NM offshore to a line bearing 200 degrees true from a point at 30-00N 083-50W (the Econfina River, FL) out to 200 NM offshore.  All stations’ inland boundaries are the coastal and inland waters between their respective boundaries except Station Dauphin Island, which runs north in the headwaters of Mobile Bay up to the CSX railroad at Mile 14.  The 200 NM offshore is the Group boundary, but the 41 foot UTBs are limited to 30 NM offshore unless they receive a waiver.  The performance period for each boat is twenty-one (21) calendar days.  The place of performance is not geographically restricted, however, for the boat to travel by water, it must remain within its area of operation.  Any contractor providing for work to be accomplished at a commercial location outside the area of operation will have to transport the boat by land at the contractor’s expense, which shall be included in the amount bid.  At the present time, the acquisition is expected to be issued as a small business set aside.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HUBZone certified and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to gmcdaniel@mlca.uscg.mil or by fax (757) 628-4676.  Questions may be referred to Ms. Gail McDaniel at (757) 628-4649.  In your response please include the following:  (a) a positive statement of your intent to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact, and telephone numbers;(c) past performance references with points of contact and phone numbers; and (d) if your company does not own a drydock, a letter of commitment from the company providing the drydock during the performance period of this availability.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable. Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other HUBZone small business concerns.  Your response is required by April 25, 2003. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone set aside.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in pursuing this requirement as a small business set aside. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone small business set aside or as a small business set aside will be posted in www.fedbizopps.gov.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Transuranic Waste Retrieval & Packaging Operations
<DESC>APRIL 2003 INDUSTRY ONE-ON-ONES
ON THE DRAFT RFP No. 96249 FOR THE
SUPPLEMENTAL TECHNOLOGY-CONTACT HANDLED TRU PACKAGING SYSTEM


CH2M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. (CH2M HILL) is evaluating combining transuranic (TRU) waste retrieval and packaging operations at the Department of Energy Hanford site into a single, complete turnkey, procurement.  CH2M Hill is actively seeking industry input through an information exchange to ensure the final RFP is an effective method to acquire the services of a subcontractor to design, fabricate, test, deploy, and operate two (2) identical mobile retrieval and contact handled TRU packaging units, while ensuring protection of human health and the environment.  Supporting information for evaluation includes a draft RFP, covering the TRU packaging process, and tank/waste data associated with retrieval scope.  This supporting information is presently available for review and industry comment/questions by visiting CH2M HILL’s Web Site at www.hanford.gov/chgcp/currentprocurement.cfm.  In addition, CH2M HILL is providing firms the opportunity to meet with members of the Source Evaluation Board (SEB) to offer suggestions for improvement and identify areas that may be excessively complex or unclear and require further explanation.

These industry information exchanges are scheduled to be conducted during May 5-7, 2003 in Conference Room 1200 of CH2M HILL’s offices located at 2440 Stevens Drive, Richland, Washington.  Meetings will be scheduled with those firms that (1) provide a written expression of interest prior to close of business April 22, 2003, (2) include a description of the firm’s relevant experience associated with performing commercial, petrochemical, Department of Energy (DOE), and/or Department of Defense (DOD) work scopes consisting of waste retrieval and sludge packaging operation, engineering, design, fabrication, startup and testing, mobilization and de-mobilization, and decommissioning, and (3) provide the name, phone number, and email address of the individual to contact at the company for the time and date of the company’s meeting with the SEB.  Companies may either fax their written expression of interest to (509) 376-0825 or email to Garry_L_Amidan@rl.gov.  Use of U.S. mail or other carriers is also acceptable by sending the correspondence to CH2M HILL Hanford Group, Inc, to the attention of Garry Amidan, MSIN H6-16 at PO Box 1500, Richland, WA, 99352 or overnight mail service to CH2M HILL Hanford Group, Inc, to the attention of Garry Amidan at 2240 Stevens Drive, Richland, WA. 99352.  

Interested firms will be notified by email or telephone of the day and time for their individual meetings by April 24, 2003.  The duration of each firm’s meeting will be for one hour and the SEB requests that the firms restrict their comments/questions to the draft RFP and/or ancillary documents.  During the meetings, any non-procurement sensitive information will be responded to by the SEB and the questions and responses from these meetings will be posted on the CH2M HILL’s Web Site.  The SEB will assign no attribution to questions or comments.  The SEB is looking for honest, objective information from the industry one-on-ones in the formulation of the final RFP.


I.  OBJECTIVES FOR THE PROJECT
 
The U.S. Department of Energy, Office of River Protection (ORP) and CH2M HILL have created aggressive execution strategies and implementation plans to accelerate the closure of the Hanford Site tank farms.  CH2M HILL will perform the role of integrator for waste retrieval and tank closure, storage and disposal of treated wastes, and processing tank waste via supplemental treatment/disposal technologies.  In order for CH2M HILL to cost-effectively retrieve, treat and disposition tank waste using supplemental treatment techniques, alternate technical and administrative approaches are being sought to improve the draft RFP.

II.  INDUSTRY INFORMATION EXCHANGES

CH2M HILL is seeking the assistance of the business community to clarify direction for removal, packaging, and shipment of radioactive TRU waste sludges from Hanford storage tanks.  CH2M HILL is interested in applying innovative strategies, approaches, and technical processes to perform this TRU operation at the most cost-effective method available while maintaining an equally high level of safety and environmental protection.

CH2M HILL is desirous in exploring options that provide new or revised methods for state and regulatory permitting, safety analysis application, DOE criteria application, design, testing, deployment, startup, operation, transport, and decommissioning of retrieval, packaging, and shipping TRU waste at the Hanford site.  CH2M HILL is seeking industry assistance to identify regulatory, design, and operational criteria in its RFP that will allow the broadest application of commercial practices to accelerate schedule and minimize cost.  CH2M HILL will apply the innovative options in collaboration with the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington State Department of Health (WDOH), Tribal Nations, other DOE sites and stakeholder groups.  CH2M HILL is also extremely interested in applying fundamental business changes, including changing work processes, to achieve operations and management efficiencies ensuring that work practices will be tailored to the hazards involved in compliance with established integrated safety management systems (ISMS) and environmental management principles.  The draft RFP and technical information reflects current strategic plans but final application for TRU processing will implement the best application(s) that support the aggressive ORP and CH2M HILL tank closure plan.

In order to improve the benefit of these meetings, CH2M HILL has identified specific topics for discussion.  Offerors should come prepared to discuss specific requirements, terms, and conditions related to the draft RFP and scope described below that may be revised to allow use of offerors technology to reduce cost/schedule risk to the job.  CH2M HILL will not attribute industry input provided in the information exchange to any prospective offeror, and will seek to protect all appropriately marked proprietary and business sensitive information.

Topics for discussion:

1.	Scope of Proposed Operations.  Effort shall include the following activities:
a.	Characterization of waste for Acceptable Knowledge to meet Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) criteria
b.	Retrieval of tank TRU sludge waste
c.	Dewatering and waste water disposal [if applicable] 
d.	Packaging waste in accordance with WIPP criteria
e.	Shipment of waste to onsite temporary storage for shipment to WIPP
f.	Redeployment at other storage tanks
g.	Removal of systems from Hanford facilities upon work completion and disposal of secondary waste in compliance with site requirements
h.	Obtain all permits and licenses

2.	Scope of Offeror Effort for System Hardware:
a.	Design
b.	Build/Fabricate
c.	Construct
d.	Deploy
e.	Test
f.	Operate/Maintain
g.	Decontaminate and Dispose

3.	How can CH2M HILL foster and stimulate innovative and creative approaches to accelerate the closure of tanks containing TRU wastes. 

4.	Procurement.  CH2M HILL prefers to award a competitively selected firm fixed price or fixed unit price subcontract that would cover the full scope of processing waste, including waste retrieval from the tanks, design and fabrication of the necessary equipment, operation of the packaging system, and removing the equipment.  Your firm should be prepared to discuss the following issues:
a.	What are the key contractual concepts necessary to improve competition for such fixed price arrangement covering the full scope (retrieval to packaging)?  What economic and other adjustments would be necessary to accommodate a fixed price arrangement for retrieval and packaging of the first tank waste amount, with options for additional tanks?
b.	How can CH2M HILL improve prospective offeror knowledge to enable offerors to prepare meaningful price proposals?
c.	What are the important discriminating factors that CH2M HILL should consider in making a competitive selection?
d.	CH2M HILL’s bargaining agreement requires unions labor (HAMTC) to operate the retrieval and packaging systems on the Hanford Site. Under what conditions/requirements are in order for your firm to allow our union labor to operate your equipment?

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and will only be available on the internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov; .proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation identified as CPSA-CAP82-C.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-13.  This solicitation is set aside for small business and the associated North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 532411 and the size standard is $6 million.  INTRODUCTION – The General Services Administration has a requirement in support of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) requirement for a fully found, general purpose vessel, operating personnel, fuel, oil, food, and support equipment as specified to support marine geological and geophysical research. It is desirable to have the vessel acoustically quiet.
   Specific missions may include extended over-the-side wire-line operations, extended station keeping, and deployment of shallow and deep-towed instruments.
   Upon completion of mobilization in Redwood City, Ca., or a port within the planned work area, the vessel will transit and begin work in the waters between Pt Arguello and the Mexican border. The final decision on where the mobilization/demobilization will be is that of the USGS, it will be where it is most cost effective for the USGS. Bids should consider both options.
   The work is expected to take place in mid-July 2003 although a period between the 15th of  June and ending no later than the eighth of August 2003 will be considered. The work is estimated to take 11 days in addition to  2 days transit, (only if the mobilization/demobilization is in Redwood City, Ca.) to and from the work area and 6 days mobilization and demobilization. The total ship time should not exceed 19 days.
   The objective of the marine geophysical and geological investigations is to collect geophysical data and seafloor samples.   

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
   The contractor shall provide the fully found vessel, personnel, facilities, food, fuel, oil and support equipment to enable the Government to conduct continuous 24 hours per day, seven days per week, open ocean geologic and geophysical surveys. The contractor shall be responsible for all preparations and maintenance of the vessel and vessel equipment necessary to ensure safe and proper working conditions for extended periods at sea. The vessel shall meet all applicable U.S. Coast Guard requirements. The USGS will install, operate and maintain necessary geophysical and sampling equipment and instrumentation to accomplish the mission objective. Up to sixteen (16) scientists may be aboard during transit and data collection.

MOBILIZATION/DEMOBILIZATION
   Mobilization represents the in-port period during which the USGS will load, install and test its Government-furnished property (GFP). This will start when the vessel has been made available at a port within the planned survey area or has been delivered to Redwood City, California. The contractor’s crew may be requested to assist in the loading and placement of the equipment. Mobilization is expected to take three to four days depending on the ship configuration.

   Demobilization represents the in-port period during which the Government-furnished property will be removed by the USGS at the port of mobilization or Redwood City, California. Demobilization is expected to take no longer than two days.

   Transit time is the time required for the vessel to travel from the mobilization port to the work area and return for demobilization.

   Operation at sea time is defined as that time the contractor’s vessel and crew is available and fully capable of at-sea operation. The course, direction and ship movement is at Government discretion with due consideration for ship safety as determined by vessel master.

   Contractor’s down time shall be defined as that period when the contractor’s vessel and/or crew is not capable of carrying out the Government’s mission.

   In port time is defined as that time in port required by the contractor to refuel, reprovision and resupply the vessel. It is also the time required to change out the scientific party and/or transfer scientific data acquired prior to the port call. Any such change out should not exceed twelve hours. The Government’s operation probably will not require port time during the 11 days of data collection at sea and the vessel should be prepared for continuous operation during this interval.

DESIRED VESSEL SPECIFICATIONS

SIZE: Minimum length of 135 feet with a breadth of at least 32 feet. 

SPEED: Vessel shall be self propelled, have a transit speed of at least nine knots in sea state 4, speed control of +/-0 .5 knots in the 0-4 knot range. The vessel should be capable of holding a constant speed of three knots and constant heading over an extended period of time.

STATION KEEPING: Normal deck work through sea state 5; limited work through sea state 7; station keeping in 35 knot winds and sea state 5 and 2 knot current.

ENDURANCE: Fourteen days minimum.

ACCOMMODATIONS AND MESSING: The vessel shall have adequate accommodations for up to sixteen scientists (male and female) preferably in two-person staterooms. If less than 16 berths are available, the vessel will need to accommodate at least fourteen scientists in addition to a berthing van for 2 scientists (see optional government equipment listed below). Staterooms must have air conditioning. Linen and laundry facilities are to be provided. In addition to meals normally served at breakfast, lunch and dinner, the contractor shall provide for a midnight meal for up to nine persons. 

DECK WORK AREA; LAB AREA; POWER
    It is desired to have a minimum of 1200 contiguous square feet (20’ x 60’) of clean deck area on the fantail to accommodate a steel-based winch weighing approximately 40,000 pounds and vans weighing up to 17,000 pounds each, in addition space to store and deploy sampling equipment.  If the government provides a generator to accommodate the government-furnished property a diesel fuel hookup should be made available on the deck area.
   The deck must be able to withstand the weight of the government furnished property and be solid enough so that feet and tie downs can be used to securely fasten the vans and winches.
The deck must be high enough off water so that electrical Government Furnished Property (GFP) are not in danger of swamping, and close enough to water so that sampling gear can be safely used.

1.This van is optional. If space is available it would be put on    board for core storage and extra work space.

2. To be used in the event that the contractor cannot supply berthing for up to 16 scientists.

3. This will require a diesel fuel hook-up.

4. If needed, the USGS can provide this generator to power its own vans; the vessel must power the rest of the GFP.



ALTERNATIVE TO GOVERNMENT FURNISHED VANS
    If the vessel cannot support the two electronics vans the vessel shall provide an adequate, air-conditioned, enclosed space with a minimum of 500 square feet. This space must have clean power (110vac/60hz 30 amps) for electronics equipment. It must also have at least two bulkhead fittings separated from each other to allow cables to be run from the lab space to the fantail.
    If this alternative is used then the USGS would still require 700 contiguous square feet, (20’x 35’) of clean deck area on fantail to mount the support van and winches, and from which to deploy the sampling gear.
   If this alternative is chosen by the contractor, then one more day of mobilization will be required but at no cost to the government.

REQUIRED/DESIRED SHIP’S EQUIPMENT
   The vessel shall have an adequate stern U-frame/A-frame/davit to handle winch wire using a 30” diameter sheave. The A-frame should have a distance of fifteen to twenty feet below the pad eye to the deck, a minimum static load rating of ten tons, and a lifting capacity of seventy-five hundred pounds minimum. 
   It is necessary to have an on-board crane capable of lifting a minimum of 2,500pounds to service the entire fantail area and for the vessel to have a capstan on the fantail for aft deck equipment rigging and emergency equipment recovery.

SHIP’S CREW
   The Captain and Chief Mate need to have previous experience in operating vessels for station keeping abilities and seismic-reflection surveys. Resumes must be submitted.
