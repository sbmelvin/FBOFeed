<DESC>POC:  Tangee Brookie, U. S. Geological Survey, Box 25046, MS-204A, Denver, CO 80225, e-mail: tbrookie@usgs.gov.  The U. S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division, Kansas District, has a requirement for a nitrate sensor for continuous use in streams and lake systems.  The instrument must be able to measure nitrate concentrations in water to an accuracy of +-0.03 mg/L, without the use of chemical reagents.  It must be able to measure nitrate concentrations every 2 seconds, provide digital output to a DCP, be RS-232 compatible with existing instrumentation at Lake Olathe and Cheney Reservoir.  The instrument must be able to compute nitrate concentration across a broad range of the nitrate absorption spectrum.  The instrument must also require little maintenance and be doployable for extended periods of time.  Based on information at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the equipment specified as a sole source requirement from Satlantic, Inc., 3841 N. Marginal Road, Halifax Nova Scotia, Canada, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required equipment are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSC POL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c)	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC POL #215 '737 7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                                              ].

<DESC>The Presidio Trust, a Federal government corporation, is soliciting bids from qualified general contractors (herein refer to as Contractor) to perform temporary shoring of the existing roof structure at Building 1047 Edie Road (herein refer to as Building 1047) on the Presidio of San Francisco. 

The Presidio is a National Park and a National Historic Landmark District. Building 1047, a historic structure built in 1914, was originally constructed for use as a laundry plant for the Letterman Hospital. Building 1047 is a single story concrete structure that is approximately 11,700 square foot on the 1st floor, with a partial basement and no attic. The roof is composed of composition rolled roofing on the main portion with mission tiles on the mansard along the building’s perimeter.  Roof framing is straight wood sheathing over wood joists which span to wood trusses.  The entire building is currently un-occupied.
 
The scope of the construction work includes but is not limited to providing shoring and the rising of the roof deck (back to the original elevation in order to properly drain rain water) in the locations adjacent to the existing roof’s trusses and hip beams.  The existing mechanical equipment on the roof will be removed by others before this work starts which should facilitate the lift operation.  In addition to the work shown on the drawing the scope also include the removal and installation of approximately 160 linear foot of 2X12 damaged roof joists between lines 5 and 6 and lines B and C.  The Presidio Trust will provide all materials needed to the contractor to accomplish the work which includes Ellis shores, Simpson Strong-Ties, Keg Tico nails, 4X4 and 4X6 Douglas fir lumbers, 3X12 PT and 2X12 and 4X12 Douglas fir lumbers.  The contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, equipment and incidental supplies and materials, transportation and insurance required to perform the work.  All work shall be performed in accordance with the enclosed drawing, which is incorporated into this IFB.  The drawing will provide further descriptions and locations of the work.  Contractor shall perform all work in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, codes, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the Uniform Building Code (UBC) as a minimum standards.

Building 1047 is a facility known to have or have had asbestos containing material (ACM) and lead-based paint (LBP) used in its construction materials at various times throughout the facility’s history.  Certain materials are still classified as “presumed asbestos containing materials” (PACM).  Some materials have been tested to determine asbestos content and are considered ACM or non-ACM, based on previous survey performed for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Versar reports).  Versar reports are available for Contractor’s review and are located in the Presidio Trust’s libraries at Building 34 and Building 1750.
Prior to performing any work that may disturb PACM/ACM and LBP, Contractor shall determine the status of materials to be impacted and/or disturbed.  If available reports do not clearly list a determination as non-ACM, materials must be assumed to contain asbestos.  Contractor shall contact a Certified Asbestos Consultant prior to any planned installation or demolition activity that will impact PACM/ACM.
Any work that may impact or disturb PACM/ACM and LBP shall only be performed by properly trained, currently license and certified abatement contractors.  Depending on the scope or location of the work, the Trust may, in its sole discretion, require the work to be monitored by a Certified Asbestos/Lead-based paint Consultant.

After award of the Purchase Order, the Contractor shall provide a list of any subcontractors that will be working on this project before the work begins. The Contractor shall submit a Project Schedule in bar chart form, showing all phases of the work.  

The permit fee will be waived for this project. The Presidio Trust Project Manager will be responsible for obtaining compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the National Policy Act for this installation.

Davis Bacon Act (U.S. Department of Labor prevailing wages) applies to the construction phase.  
Minimum qualifications: California Contractor’s License and insurance.  

Contractor shall commence work upon receipt of the Trust’s Purchase Order and verbal issuance of the Trust’s Notice to Proceed (NTP).  Contractor shall complete all work described in this IFB within twenty-one (21) consecutive calendar days.
 
A site visit scheduled for Wednesday, August 18, 2004 at 10:00 am is mandatory prior to submitting bids. All bids are due by the close of business Friday, August 27, 2004.  Please submit all bids by fax to Lela Chisolm, at The Presidio Trust, at (415) 561-4485.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake, CA intends to procure on a full and open competition basis a cost plus fixed fee contract for a spread spectrum, point-to-point, high-rate data link. This procurement will be a 100% small business set-aside.  The objective of this procurement is to develop the software/firmware necessary to provide a bi-directional, full-duplex, point-to-point, high data rate, spread spectrum data link capability; integrate the software/firmware into a hardware demonstration board that will be provided by the Government; and to successfully demonstrate a data link meeting the specifications listed.  The hardware demonstration board will operate using an Intermediate Frequency (IF).  The firmware developed shall be transportable and loadable into the Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) hardware demonstration board using Joint Test Action G roup (JTAG) interfaces.  Demonstration of the data link will be required.  Contractors are encouraged to purpose solutions that will shorten development time, for example, modification of existing telephony or data link software.  The link operation will be a point-to-point full duplex link with channel separation achieved via Frequency Division Duplex (FDD).  The link is meant to operate in a point-to-point configuration with one or both points moving.  The data link is not meant for long duration data exchange; instead, maximum throughput is required for a minimum of link up time.  Operational data rates shall be variable in discrete steps within the range of 125 Kbps to 2 Mbps.  Maximum user data rate (data rate after FEC (forward error correction) overhead is removed) shall be no less than 1 Mbps.  The allowable hardware targets, consist of a chipset (AHA4540), FPGA (Strati x EP1S80F1020C5), and DSP (TigerSharc 201).  The software/firmware will be written in AHDL (Altera Hardware Design Language) if the FPGA is used, and in C code if the DSP hardware is used.  If it is required to optimize performance of sections of the DSP code, it is permissible to write the code in Assembly language.  Desired modulation is coherent Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) supporting Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) or Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK), or other forms of Phase Shift Keying (PSK).  It is desired to produce a nearly constant channel bandwidth at any of the data rates, thus various spread factors may be employed based on data rate to maintain channel bandwidth.  Offerors should specify the type of spread spectrum techniques that will be incorporated in their proposals.  Chip rates should be chosen to produce, after spreading, approxima tely 40 MHz null-to-null bandwidth (NNBW).  The data link software/firmware should be programmable to accommodate various spreading codes (the system should not be hard coded to only one instance of a particular spreading code).  The desired BER in all instances should be no worse than 1.E-5 (with 1.E-6 as a goal).  Anticipated Eb/No (average bit energy to single-sided noise power density) values range from 6 to 10 dB based on range and data rate.  The link function will include provision for Forward Error Correction (FEC) and physical automatic resend/request (ARQ).  Uncoded BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK waveforms will not meet this goal in all cases so it is anticipated that FEC will be required with as low coding overhead as possible to maximize user data throughput.  TURBO and TURBO Product Codes (TPC) offer good performance with high coding rates (low overhead).  The nominal rates, as  well as a choice on block sizes, should be easily selectable in software with nominal rates greater than 0.75.  The data link must use ARQ methods for resending data that is corrupted or lost by the data link.  The data waveform structure shall be capable of maintaining the link even if no data is available to send over-the-air until a terminate link control signal is received.  The software/firmware will also provide a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) function.  A locked/unlocked signal indicator will also be required to indicate when the link is correctly synchronized.  The data link waveform design must include the necessary pilot sequences or other means for initial acquisition, synchronization, and latency control.  Appropriate buffering for physical (separation distance) latency of packets/frames and software induced latency of packets/frames is required.  Input/ output shall be a TCP/IP interface.  The link function will include variable data rate communication based on measured link parameters.  The receiver software/firmware will perform all other necessary filtering, decimation, and corrections necessary to the data for proper demodulation.  The software/firmware will include control functions for external automatic gain control (AGC).  Maximum coding and configuration flexibility is desired.  The data link must handle frequency dynamics and offsets (Doppler and frequency mismatch) in the carrier recovery process.  The data link should handle +/- 30 KHz of variation referenced to the IF.  The dynamics of this motion are 1) offset frequency due to Doppler effects:  +/- 30 KHz, and 2) potential accelerations:  +/- 1000 Hz/sec.  The Government will require the ability to use the software for its own development purposes and for product ion units.  The production units may require the software developed to be given to a non-Government contractor for Government uses.  Production quantities are anticipated to be approximately 100 units.  Delivery is FOB Destination to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake, CA 22 weeks after contract award.  Award will be made using the Level of Confidence Assessment Rating (LOCAR).  The solicitation will be issued on or about 12 July 2004 and will be available through the 2.0 Contracts Competency home pages at: https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm.  The anticipated award date is 30 September 2004.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Responses should be submitted to Deborah Winfield, by mail to NAWCWPNS, Code 210000D, 429 E. Bowen Rd – Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108 or fax to (760) 939-9651, o r email to Deborah.Winfield@navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Laboratory of Functional and Molecular Imaging (LFMI), intends to procure, on a sole-source basis with Resonance Research, Inc., 10 Cook Street, Billerica, MA  01821, three (3) Small Bore MRI Gradient Sets and one (1) Shim Power Supply for LFMI’s 7T/31 cm and 11.7T/31cm MRI systems.   The requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334510 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  LFMI has a state-of-the-art, 11.7T horizontal MRI spectrometer for performing brain imaging of rodents at very-high spatial and temporal resolution and has recently acquired a 7T horizontal MRI for performing MRI on brain in rodents and other animal models.  LFMI seeks to acquire three MRI gradient/shim units, two (2) for the new 7T animal MRI and one (1) for the 11.7T MRI and one shim power supply with radiofrequency filters for the 7T MRI.  The contractor shall be capable of providing the following items: Two (2) 9 cm ID gradients with an OD less than 15 cm, one (1) for the 11.7T MRI and one (1) for the 7T MRI.  The desired specifications for these gradients are a minimum of 600 mT/m gradient strength and a rise time not to exceed 100 microseconds to full gradient strength.  Both the 11.7T and 7T MRI have existing gradient amplifiers capable of 300V/200A that can be used to achieve the required gradient strengths and rise times.  The gradients should be actively shielded with as large a linear volume as possible.  There should be a set of shims with this gradient that are capable of at least 250 Hz/cmn/A on each shim channel.  The following shim coils should be available:  Z0, Z2, ZX, ZY,C2 and S2.  LFMI also requires one (1) gradient/shim set with a minimum ID of 15 cm, and a maximum OD of 26 cm for its 7T MRI.  The gradient strength should be greater than or equal to 450 mT/m and the rise time not to exceed 100 microseconds to full gradient strength. The 7T MRI will have gradient amplifiers capable of 500V/300A that can be used to achieve the required gradient strengths and rise times. The gradients should be actively shielded with as large a linear volume as possible.  There should be a set of shims with this gradient that are capable of at least 100 Hz/cmn/A on each shim channel.  The following shim coils should be available:  Z0, Z2, ZX, ZY,C2 and S2.   Finally, LFMI requires one (1) shim power supply capable of supplying 10 Amps to each of the shim coils and one (1) set of radiofrequency filters for the shim power supply.  A key factor in LFMI’s research projects is to increase the spatial resolution of the acquired images.  The spatial resolution achievable in MRI depends mainly on four factors:  the magnetic field strength, the ability to vary the magnetic field strength in a tightly controlled manner, the magnetic field homogeneity, and detector sensitivity.  The magnetic field strength and detector sensitivity dictates the available signal-to-noise ration (SNR) of MR images.  Pushing for higher spatial resolution strongly depends on the available SNR.  Spatial resolution also depends on the ability to vary the magnitude of the magnetic field strength spatially in a well-controlled manner as well as adjusting and maintaining a very homogeneous main magnetic field.  To vary the magnitude of the magnetic field a specialized set of three (3) axial gradient coils is inserted in the bore of the magnet.  These gradient coils are surrounded by another set of shim coils for adjusting magnetic field homogeneity.  Gradient coils have two major technical specifications that need to be considered to evaluate its performance:  maximum gradient intensity, given in units of mT/m, and rise time given in microseconds.  The maximum gradient strength determines how strong the gradient fields are, and therefore determine how well separated spin locations are, therefore being the major determinant of spatial resolution.  Typical gradient strengths in human-sized magnets range from 20-45 mT/m.  In animal-sized magnets, gradients strengths can reach 300-400 mT/m in 9 -12 cm internal diameter (ID) gradients, or up to 1000 mT/m in 6 cm ID.  The gradient ID should be large enough to allow animals to be accommodated inside their space, and thus for the rodents used in LFMI the minimum ID required is 9 cm, while imaging of larger animal models requires a minimum ID of 15 cm.  The goal of this procurement is to approach small ID (6 cm gradient performance) on a 9 cm ID gradient and 9 cm ID gradient performance on a 15 cm ID gradient.  This will enable higher resolution in faster imaging times on larger samples.    Shim coils have one major technical specification and that is the field gradient that can be produced per ampere of current.  The current standard for most commercial shim sets for animal scanners is to produce approximately 100 Hz/cmn/A.  Recent experiments within the 11.7T MRI in LFMI have demonstrated that shim values of at least 250 Hz/cmn/A with a shim power supply capable of producing 10 Amps are necessary to adequately adjust the homogeneity of the magnetic field around the rodent head.  Resonance Research is the only source known to the Government that can provide the above requirements with these unique features.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NINDS researcher to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on August 9, 2004.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509 or by email at cb106x@nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Reference RFQ-NCI-40117-NQ on all correspondance.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-04-00369, and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside competition Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in  effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710, which has a size standard of 500 employees to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated  to result from the award of  this solicitation. This procurement is for the screening for hepatocytes from the date of award through September 30, 2005. A number of chemicals activate the CAR and PXR pathways in rats and mice.  Activation of these pathways leads to a variety of biochemical and toxicological effects.  Recent  evidence suggests that there are species differences in the structure activity relationship for activating this pathway between mice, rats and humans.  This contract is for EPA to obtain RNA samples from fresh mouse, rat and human primary hepatocytes exposed to environmental chemicals.  The RNA  will be used to characterize activation of CAR/PXR pathways.  The contractor is required to perform three phases of work: 1. Initial dose range finding study. 2. A dose response study in rat hepatocytes.  3. A dose response study in human hepatocytes. The following minimum and maximum number of  chemicals are anticipated. Minimum number of chemicals - 6; Maximum number of chemicals - 10. Phase 1. Initial Dose Range Finding Studies in Rat Hepatocytes. 1. Obtain rat hepatocytes.  The contractor will certify that the animals were treated in accordance to NIH guidelines.   Males and females of  either Sprague-Dawley, Wistar or Long Evans rat strains may be requested.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Petar Bojic, Director, Cian d.o.o., Varazdinska 51, HR 21000, Croatia, Phone: +385 21 540 190, Fax: +385 21 540 199
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of a medical waste management system for the Split/Dalmatia region in Croatia.

Croatia currently has 21 counties generating approximately 2,500 tons of medical waste per year.  The majority of Croatian medical waste used to be incinerated at a facility in Zagreb, until an accident occurred at the factory and the plant was shut down in 2002.  This incident raised new concerns over the country’s ability to treat medical waste and to do so in a manner that would comply with EU directives.  The Ministry quickly passed new legislation requiring the proper disposal of hospital waste to be treated at a selected number of locations with proper facilities.  However, the facilities needed to collect, treat, and dispose of this waste do not exist.

To deal with this problem, the Ministry decided to grant a concession to Cian, an industrial hazardous waste company based in the Split/Dalmatia region (where the majority of Croatia’s medical waste is generated).  It will be Cian’s responsibility to receive all of the medical waste for the region, collect, treat, and process it in a suitable manner.  

Cian is already in charge of the collection and treatment of hazardous waste from several southern Dalmatian counties.  Cian presently has a facility that accommodates most forms of hazardous waste, however, the company does not have the knowledge or technology to handle large amounts of medical waste.  Because it is estimated that Cian would be responsible for the collection and treatment of over 600 tons of medical waste per year, Cian needs additional training, technology, and equipment.  

In order to determine a medical waste management system for Cian, this project would examine medical waste from the University Hospital in Split.  The University Hospital is considered to be the largest producer of medical waste in the country based on the medical waste that it generates and also receives from other hospitals and clinics.  The University Hospital is owned by the Croatian Ministry of Health.  The University Hospital would serve as an important benchmark for gauging the appropriate equipment and technology needed to safely collect, treat, and process medical waste at Cian and other sites across the nation.  

An important component to this project is Cian’s ability to convert a significant amount of the medical waste into usable energy.  This would be achieved through incinerator/pyrolysis systems.  A pyrolysis system subjects hazardous wastes to high temperatures and gas, the combination of which breaks the waste down, rendering it innocuous.  In contrast to incineration, the process produces low emissions and, depending upon the system, it may also generate energy.  The successful implementation of this technology would create additional revenues for Cian, while establishing a new source of electricity in the region in an environmentally safe manner.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $105,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a pilot project to improve existing and/or develop new drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities in four municipalities in the Siret River Basin region in Romania.  

Romania has a very fragmented water resource infrastructure system that is unequally distributed within a large territory (232,000 square km) and among a large population (22 million inhabitants).  In Romania, 13,000 villages and more than 200 small and medium towns lack facilities for drinking water and wastewater treatment.  The necessary investments needed to bring the water quality of these townships up to European Union (EU) standards will exceed 14 billion euro, which exceeds state and local budgetary resources.  

As part of Romania’s compliance with EU regulations, the country must adopt a comprehensive water management policy known as the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD).  The WFD became effective December 22, 2000 and aims to expand the scope of water protection to all waters, surface waters, and groundwater.  Within the WFD, the EU outlines the best model for a single system of water management based on a river basin management system.  The river basin is a natural geographical and hydrological unit that brings together upstream and downstream interests, including local, regional, and national authorities, as well as NGOs and other stakeholders.  Each EU member state must identify individual river basins and assign them to individual river basin districts.  For each river basin district, some of which traverse national frontiers, a “river basin management plan” will need to be established and updated every 6 years.  The goal of the WFD is to coordinate in a river basin context the application of EU local level measures, such as the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, the Nitrates Directive that addresses particular pollution problems, and the Drinking Water Directive.

The Government of Romania (GOR), acting through the Ministry of Environment and Water Management, is currently negotiating the environmental chapter of the acquis communitaire and has adopted the river basin management approach to water management within the WFD.  The GOR has identified the Siret River Basin as the first area of priority to try and implement the WFD, as it is the largest river basin in Romania located in the northeast section of the country adjacent to Moldova.  The Siret River Basin is a semi-arid area with water shortages and difficulties in maintaining water supply during certain periods each year.  Only about 1.2 million of the 2.6 million inhabitants, or 45% of the total population benefit from centralized water supply systems.  Nearly 30 Siret River Basin municipalities require modernization, improvement, rehabilitation or expansion of their drinking water and wastewater treatment systems.  Therefore, implementation of the Water Framework Directive in the Siret River Basin will be the largest project in Romania’s water sector.  Due to the overall goal of the project, the GOR refers to this project as the WATFRAME project.

The objective of the proposed feasibility study is to prepare a pilot project to examine four (4) municipalities in the Siret River Basin and design a solution to improve existing or develop new drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities.  These four localities, to be identified by the Ministry of Environment and Water Management (the Grantee), are small to medium-sized localities, which are not eligible or likely to receive EU financing.   The four municipalities will represent the most common drinking water and wastewater planning situations in the river basin from the perspectives of population, pollution dischargers, watershed, receiving stream, and existing infrastructure characteristics.  These four localities will serve as a demonstration of the river basin planning approach to municipal drinking water and wastewater management for the remaining 11 river basins in Romania.   

This feasibility study will examine the technical, economic, and financial feasibility of implementing the River Basin Management Plan in the Siret River Basin.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $562,080 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Ioan Jelev, Secretary of State, Ministry of Environment and Water Management, 12 Libertatii Blvd., Sector 5, Bucharest, Romania; Phone: 40-21-410-0243; Fax: 40-21-312-4227; E-mail: jelev@mappm.ro.
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform a feasibility study which will develop a modernization plan for the Government of Romania’s network of government environmental laboratories.

The Environmental Protection Department within the Romanian Ministry of Environment and Water Management (MEWM) implements its programs through a network of 8 Regional Environmental Protection Agencies (REPAs).  The REPAs, in turn, must manage 42 Local Environmental Protection Agencies (LEPAs), one for each county.  The REPAs and LEPAs, respectively, are responsible for developing and carrying out regional and local environmental action plans.  Each LEPA maintains a local environmental lab. 

All three levels of the Environmental Protection Department network must have the capability to take and analyze samples from pollution sources and the ambient environment, including air, water, soil, waste, noise and radiation samples.  The MEWM has proposed that the existing network of 42 local environmental labs and one central environmental laboratory be supplemented by expanding and improving the existing national laboratory and by creating 8 regional laboratories through upgrades to 8 of the existing 42 local laboratories.  

Laboratories receiving upgrades will require significant staff training, management capacity building, and new analytical and IT equipment.  IT capabilities would include both slow systems such as monitoring sensors working in real time feeding data to databases and models, as well as fast systems that provide alarms and notification of critical pollution events.  The Government of Romania would like to be able to exchange data with DESWAT, SIMIN, REMES and other national alert and decision-making systems. 

The Study will advise the Government of Romania on the organization and structure of the laboratory network’s staff and information flow, define equipment requirements and common procedures, develop training requirements, and assist with laboratory accreditation.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $281,105 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

<DESC>It is the intent of the NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division, Orlando, FL to solicit and   award a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract of less than $500,000.00 to Northrop Grumman (NG) Defense Mission Systems, (55 John Clarke Road, Middletown, RI), under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), set forth in FAR 6.302-1(d)(2), titled, “only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements”.  The Government intends to enhance the 14E35 Generic Reconfigurable Training System  (GRTS), SQQ-89 Sonar Suite Basic Operator Trainer (BOT) at Fleet Anti Submarine Warfare Training Center  (FASW), San Diego, CA.  This sole source award is based on the following: 

1.  Budget Risk:  The available funds are limited and will not allow for learning curve costs.  The award must be in a FFP vehicle, any other vendor must accept this type of contract.
2.  Schedule Risk:  The time frame of the FFP vehicle is limited as result of bullet #1 and the urgent needs of FASW.  The original contractor has unique knowledge and personnel assets enabling them to achieve this goal of generating the necessary enhancements within the necessary timeframe of less than eight months.
3.  Interoperability Risk: The application currently runs on the CTTAS© simulation engine, a NG Licensed product.   While a third party can legally perform changes to the GRTS student applications, NG’s familiarity with the interface requirements and ability to alter the simulation engine if required, affords the government the best value in this situation.  Unless a vendor possesses a simulation engine that can easily interface with the existing applications, and can perform the upgrades, and can provide a free site license, these requirements will incur cost that will exceed the available budget.
4.  Subject Matter Expertise.  NG performed the training analysis for this trainer, and possesses instructional design specialists and subject matter experts that are already familiar with this system and the requirements of the customer, this expertise significantly reduces risk and confusion, thus saving time and effort.
5.  ATAS database Risk:  The 14E35 BOT requires the capability to interface and work with the Government Acoustic Training and Simulation Database (ATaS) executable files, or similar database and audio generation executable that meets the fidelity requirements of a dynamic parametric acoustic audio database capable of multi-mode, multi-shaft surface and subsurface contacts.  NG has demonstrated success with this task, and will require neither learning curve nor new database expertise.

In summary, it would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a compatible product that would meet these requirements in the time specified.  Interested firms may submit their capabilities and qualifications to the identified point of contact not later than 15 July 2004 3: 00 P.M. local time.     Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.     A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.    This is not a request for quotes, and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Computer Sciences Corporation for continuation of Information Technology services to provide operations, maintenance, and scientific software applications support for the Central Environmental Satellite Computer System (CEMSCS) under the referenced contract for one year beginning November 1, 2004, plus options for six additional months.  CEMSCS is one of NOAA's primary data processing systems for satellite environmental data, operating continuously on a seven day, 24-hour schedule to ingest and process data from NOAA and other-agency satellites.  Current plans call for the CEMSCS system to be physically re-located and possibly integrated with another satellite data processing system early in FY 06.  The referenced contract is being extended to provide CEMSCS-critical services pending relocation and systems integration decisions.  The experience gained by CSC during performance of the current contract makes it the only known firm which can continue to provide the required hardware and software operations and maintenance support in this interim period without disrupting the CEMSCS system operations.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Solicitation documents are not available at this time.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to provide continuity of services for the full range of current system operations and maintenance support.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics
plans to enter into a sole source procurement with Dr. David Hunter, Newton, MA, for one year base period with an additional one year option period. In a concerted effort to identify common low-penetrance genes that play a role in the development of cancer, NCI has formed the Consortium of Cohorts.  Through a strategy comprised of parallel and pooled studies involving large population cohorts, the Consortium utilizes advances in genomic technology to identify inherited susceptibility genes and gene-environment interactions in cancer.  This unique public-private partnership currently includes 23 population cohorts in the intramural and extramural research programs.  It represents a coordinated, interdisciplinary approach that will greatly accelerate the discovery process and allow scientists to perform subset analyses and confirmatory studies to examine gene-environment and gene-gene interactions.  By working together, epidemiologists and genomicists can provide ‘instantaneous parallel replication’ of positive findings across cohorts.   Dr. Hunter will design whole genome searches that use a tiny fraction of the DNA collected from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovary screening trial cohort (PLCO) in nested case-control studies of breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal adenomas, with a second-stage replication of positive results in the Harvard cohorts.  Both of the cohorts are members of the Consortium of Cohorts.  This collaborative effort will help ensure that NCI capitalizes on the enormous potential of the Consortium of Cohorts and the opportunity at hand to lead discovery efforts in cancer genetics.  Dr. David Hunter is the Director of the Molecular and Genetic Epidemiology Program of the Harvard University School of Public Health and oversees the High-Throughput Polymorphism Detection Core lab that is part of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center and the Harvard-Partners Center for Genetics and Genomics.  As a leader of the breast and prostate cancer nested case-control studies within the NCI’s Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Trial, Dr. Hunter has unique access to biospecimens (including serum and germline DNA) and to risk factor information from his own large cohorts as well as for the 7,000 breast cancer cases and 9,000 prostate cancer cases available across the Cohort Consortium that can be used for performing the whole genome scans.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 16,  2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 541990; Size Standard 6M.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP), Health Services & Economics Branch (HSEB) plans to enter into a sole source procurement with the Oregon Health & Sciences University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR  97239 for the services of Drs Tomasz Beer, Mark Garzotto and Motomi Mori, who are experts in prostate cancer research.  Recent studies indicate that there has been increasing use of androgen deprivation (AD) as primary therapy for localized prostate cancer.(Cooperberg, Grossfeld et al. 2003)  Neither the clinical outcomes, nor the implications for other health issues, have been well characterized in this setting.  There is a growing awareness of the long-term morbidity associated with androgen deprivation including osteoporotic fractures as well as adverse changes in lipid profile and body composition, and possibly neurocognitive and psychiatric toxicity.  The objectives of this study are 1) To characterize the clinical outcomes and their predictors in patients who were treated with primary androgen deprivation for clinically localized prostate cancer and for advanced prostate cancer.  This work will be done in parallel with an analysis of quality of life outcomes in the same population led by NCI; 2)  To describe the incidence and time to event for the following outcomes:  PSA failure (confirmed with 2 rising PSAs), PSA nadir, local failure, distant failure, and cardiovascular complications, depression and treatment for depression, overall survival; 3)  To assess the effects of co-morbidities, smoking, use of herbal supplements, vitamins and minerals, socioeconomic status, insurance status, race, and geographic location on outcomes.  The aforementioned investigators of the Oregon Health & Science University have unique experience and background relevant to the development of research methods and analysis of prostate cancer outcomes necessary to carry out the research objectives as described above.  This includes having extensive experience in clinical practice relevant for understanding relevant issues in prostate cancer care, since their own medical practice is focused on this disease.   In addition they have a unique familiarity with the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study (PCOS), which is the source of the data for the proposed study.  They have been heavily involved in the analysis entitled “The Use and Outcomes of Therapies for Erectile Dysfunction Following Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: Results from the SEER Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study (PCOS)” in collaboration with NCI.  Thus, the combination of their experience in clinical care, analysis of the proposed outcomes in prostate cancer patients treated with primary hormonal therapy, and their familiarity with the PCOS data set and procedures demonstrates that the investigators are uniquely able to carry out the proposed work. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>SSA-RFP-04-1066, EARLY INTERVENTION PROCESS DEMONSTRATION - PROGRAM MANAGER.  The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (hereafter, the Ticket legislation) established many new programs and projects that are designed to remove barriers to employment for persons with disabilities.  The Ticket legislation requires SSA to implement the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency program (Title I of the Ticket legislation), makes changes to Medicare and Medicaid programs (Title II of the Ticket legislation), and provides SSA with the authority to undertake certain demonstration projects or experiments to test alternatives to current program work incentives (Title III of the Ticket legislation).  This requirement relates to a demonstration project under section 234 of the Social Security Act which was added by section 301 of Title III of The Ticket Legislation.  The purpose of this contract is to provide support for a small-scale Early Intervention Process Demonstration (EIPD) project, of which the contractor, hereafter referred to as the Early Intervention Program Manager (EIPM), will be involved with the implementation and management activities.  The information and final results obtained from the EIPD project activities will be used to assist the Social Security Administration (SSA) in evaluating the processes developed for the EIPD.  (The process evaluation will be conducted separate from this contract).  The activities specified in the Statement of Work (SOW) will test, on a small scale, early intervention (EI) processes and procedures at sites within three selected process evaluation States - New Mexico, Vermont, and Wisconsin.  Ultimately, the EIPD will provide information on the methods, procedures, and practices involved in selecting EI participants; the interventions that the participants require; the cost of the interventions; and ultimately the feasibility of using two service-delivery models (models discussed under Background section).   Chief responsibilities of the EIPM will be to develop and implement an infrastructure of Return to Work Specialists, service providers, and other stakeholders; develop and manage a computer system that can be used in several demonstration projects; manage the day-to-day early intervention activities; and collect data from the project to be used to evaluate early intervention processes and procedures.  The EIPM will also provide training, training materials, and maintain a toll-free telephone number and a website to disseminate information.   The government anticipates the award of 1 cost-reimbursement type contract for a 4.5 year period of performance.  The RFP will be available for downloading on or about August 16, 2004 via the Federal Procurement website: www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES WILL NOT BE MAILED.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information for planning purposes on engineering support for the development, fabrication, and test of an air to ground missile system similar to the AGM-114 Hellfire or Brimstone-class designed for fighter/attack jets.  This is a request for information only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is conducting an initiative to evaluate the concept of using numerous, light (<150lbs), lethal missiles for engaging a wide range of moving and stationary surface targets from conventional USAF fighter and attack jets.  Preliminary modeling and simulation results from this initiative indicate a variety of operational advantages may be offered by this concept.  The envisioned system should utilize either proven semi-active laser homing or active seeker technology to provide precise guidance either from the employing aircraft or off-board designators.  In addition, the envisioned standoff range would be at least equal or better than current AGM-114 launch from medium altitudes.  Target sets and current technology suggest blast/fragmentation, thermo baric, and shaped charge are the desired range of warhead options.  High weapons load out, low collateral damage potential, and simplified maintenance are some of the other envisioned benefits from this class of weapon.  The AEFB is primarily interested in -Off-The-Shelf products that could be adapted for this purpose.

Request information be submitted NO LATER THAN_19 August 2004_ to Major. Patrick Sullivan, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Major Sullivan can be reached at (208) 828-3511.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for the envisioned effort.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO INDICATE THAT STATEMENTS OF INTEREST SHOULD BE SUBMITTED BY AUGUST 4, 2004.  LATER SUBMITTED STATEMENTS OF INTEREST WILL BE ACCEPTED, SO LONG AS THE CAPABILITY STATEMENT IS SUBMITTED BY THE INDICATED DUE DATE.  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and the Office of Dietary Supplements of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaboration with industry to provide an alpha-adrenergic blocking drug and matching placebo for use in a National Institutes of Health sponsored multi-center clinical trial in men with lower urinary tract symptoms attributable to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

INTRODUCTION:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the Office of Dietary Supplements is planning to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate if treatment with  Serenoa repens or Pygeum africanum or an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent serving as an active control delays or prevents the progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia compared to placebo.  Treatment will be administered in a double-blind fashion.  The trial is known as the Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Urological Symptoms (CAMUS).  The four-arm trial will enroll approximately 2,800 men over a period of two years.  The following centers will be enrolling study participants:  Northwestern University, Queen’s University (Kingston, Ontario, Canada), Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, Washington University, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, the University of Colorado, Yale University, New York University, Columbia University and the University of Maryland.  Central data collection and analysis will be performed by the NIDDK funded Data Coordinating Center at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.

STUDY GOALS:  The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to determine if treatment with Serenoa repens or Pygeum africanum or an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent selected as the active control will delay or prevent the progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia compared to placebo.  The treatment period will range from four to six years.  The primary outcome is the time to clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia defined as one of the following:  an increase from baseline in the American Urological Association symptom score index of 4 or more points confirmed at the next scheduled study visit, acute urinary retention, recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections or urosepsis, new incontinence or progression of minor incontinence, and initiation of active, unblinded therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia, including phytotherapy, alpha-adrenergic blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, or any invasive therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  The protocol for this trial has been approved by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board established by the NIDDK.  It is anticipated that recruitment of study participants for this trial will begin in spring 2005. The Collaborator providing the alpha-adrenergic blocking drug will be expected to provide drug without charge for the expected 4-6 year treatment period for approximately 2,800 participants.  The Collaborator will also provide sufficient matching placebo without charge.  It is also expected that Collaborator will ship drug and placebo to a NIH-supported Drug Distribution Center free of charge.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:   A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” to help in their deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  Capability Statements related to treatment with an alpha-adrenergic blocking drug for lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia should address the following criteria:  timeline for ability to provide drug and placebo after selection of Collaborator is determined, approved daily dose of drug, previous studies of efficacy of drug in treating men with lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia and known side-effects of drug.  Statements may not exceed 10 pages.

TERMS:  The collaborator will be expected to execute a Clinical Trial Agreement, an example of which can be found at 
http://techdev.niddk.nih./forms.htm.  No funding from the government is available.

SUBMISSION DATES:   A written statement of interest SHOULD be submitted by August 4, 2004 and all Collaborator Capability Statements must be submitted by August 19, 2004.

<DESC>Provide A/E services for programming, design development and construction period services for alterations to the electrical distribution system at the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center, located in Clarksburg, WV.  The project site consists of two electrical systems that are independent.  The selected A/E will be required to survey both systems and develop a design solution considering the potential for making the systems interdependent, if practicable.  The VA requires that the construction award be made utilizing the most current version of the electrical code, so the selected A/E will be required to modify completed construction documents to account for relevant changes in the electrical code, based on the actual award date or for one year after completion of the construction documents if award is not made within the one year period.  This project will alter the existing electrical system throughout the hospital with the intent of bringing the entire electrical system into compliance with the latest version of NFPA 70, JCAHO requirements, VA specifications, guidelines and policies, and other related codes.  The predominant discipline for this project will be electrical, but this project will require other disciplines, including but not limited to mechanical engineering and architectural engineering.  Specific areas of focus for this project will include:  (1) alteration of the design of the current primary and secondary unit substations to provide a code compliant organization of equipment and operation of the essential electrical system, (2)  establishment of the distribution system for each of the three branches of the essential electrical system through and including the branch circuit level, (3) reduce the use of 4160V circuits where practicable and utilization of 480/277 and 208/120 transformation where increased capacity, safety and efficiency may be obtained, (4) inventory and provide in both database and spreadsheet format compatible with Auto Cad listings of all distribution panels including panel and branch circuit identification, voltage and current line to line and line to ground and neutral and phases, (5) space available for addition of electrical closets and installation of closets as needed, and (6) cooling and/or ventilation required for existing distribution system.  The estimated construction budget is between $2,000,000 to $5,000,000.  The estimated design time is five (5) months.  The area for consideration for this acquisition is a 200 mile radius of the VAMC, Clarksburg, West Virginia.  Interested firms must submit four (4) copies of form SF-330 to the Contracting Officer (542/90C), VAMC, 1400 Black Horse Hill Road, Coatesville, PA 19320 by COB on 9/8/2004.

<DESC>Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) plans to establish four (4) to six (6) Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) with qualified construction companies to provide construction craftsmen and supervision for the performance of HVAC work as required at the ANL site for a period of one (1) year.     Awards will be made to those HVAC companies submitting proposals most advantageous to ANL, technical, cost, and other factors considered.

These BOAs are intended for short lead-time HVAC construction projects.     Generally, the construction costs of individual work orders under the BOA will not exceed $50,000.00.     However, the total estimated cost for the one-year BOA duration is one and one half million dollars.     There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount to be awarded under these HVAC BOAs and it will be at ANL???s discretion as to when these HVAC BOAs will be utilized.     Options to extend the term of each BOA for two (2) one-year periods will also be included in the Agreement.

For an individual HVAC construction project, each BOA contractor will be asked to submit a lump sum proposal based on construction specifications and drawings.     ANL will then award a work order under the BOA to the low offeror.

Typical work awarded through work orders issued under the BOAs may include constructing, repairing or replacing: ductwork; chiller systems; steam systems; air handlers; pumps, fans, piping and control systems.

<SUBJECT>10 -- Amended RFI M67854-04-R-2021
<SOLNBR>M6785404R2021
<CONTACT>Valerie Mosqueira, Contracting Officer, Phone (703) 432-4192, Fax (703) 432-3547, Email mosqueiravj@mcsc.usmc.mil
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is issuing this Request For Information as a follow up to the RFI issued 24 May 2004.  The original RFI was to encourage discussion with industry concerning existing Short Range Air Defense System (SHORAD) hardware replacement and a possible expansion of existing capabilities to incorporate surface threats.  Based on the responses to the original RFI, further program decisions have been made and additional discussions are encouraged.  Currently fielded Avenger and Man Portable Air Defense systems (MANPADS) provide short-range air defense with or without C2 system cueing. The Marine Corps is seeking information on a replacement for the current Avenger and MANPAD system.  It is the Marine Corps’ desire to find a potential solution and gather technical and cost information to plan and budget for future requirements.  

It is the desire of Marine Corps Systems Command to develop and field a system that can provide a defensive, “force protection” capability against airborne and ground threats.  Employed and integrated with the Complimentary Low Altitude Weapon System (CLAWS), this man portable combat system will provide the MAGTF and joint forces with a layered air defense system that can detect, identify, and engage low altitude, minimal maneuvering, and asymmetrical air threats such as helicopters, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and ultra-lights.  This man portable combat system shall also be capable of engaging traditional and asymmetrical ground threats (Light armored vehicles, vehicle-borne combat troops, etc) in support of LAAD Teams that are tactically displaced or employed forward of the supported unit or defended asset.   

The man portable combat system should facilitate passive target detection with or without utilization of an external cue. If cued, the sensor package shall be capable of passive detection of  asymmetrical air targets at a minimum range of 10K.  If not cued the system shall enable the detection of asymmetrical air threats at a minimum range of 6K. The sensor shall provide at a minimum a 20-degree Field of View (FoV).  Once detected the man portable sensor package shall provide an accurate range measurement for each possible threat.  The man portable combat system sensor capability shall facilitate detection in both adverse weather and nighttime operations.  Laser designation capabilities is desired. 

The man portable combat system shall enable identification for each detected target.  The identification capability should provide the user with the ability to interrogate the detected targets and process received identification replies.  This identification capability shall enable both secure and unsecured interrogation capabilities.  Interrogations should be enabled at a minimum range of 10k. 

The man portable combat system shall enable engagement upon command of positively identified hostile targets.  These engagements should be capable of a probability of kill (Pk) = .75 at 8K, .8 at 6K, .9 < 4k for low altitude, minimally maneuverable asymmetrical air targets (Helo, UAV, Ultra-lights).  The system performance (Pk) should not degrade more than 10% in the presence of countermeasures (expendables and/or lamp, laser, or RF jammers).  The man portable system shall be capable of rapid engagement of multiple targets, minimum 3 targets per minute. 

It is desired that the man portable combat system possess a slew-to-cue capability.  It must be able to receive or internally generate target cueing data, and “translate” that data into visual and/or audio indicators that direct the operator to rapidly position the weapon towards the target in a manner that maximizes Pk.   This capability will enable interface to MilStd communication architectures, utilizing existing communications hardware interfaced to the modern, modular, common architecture, net centric man portable combat system. Interoperability with the Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S), MAGTF C2, and other joint command and control systems is required.   This cue shall provide accurate target range, azimuth, heading and velocity data to the man portable system (error no greater than one half of the FoV of the sensor at 10 K).  In addition to the target data this interface shall enable the execution of Command and Control between the combat system and higher level C2.  The system shall provide a gunner display that provides a visual interface for Command and Control Battlefield information, a thermal sight, slew to cue, display of missile generated video imagery, and laser range finding.  

The system shall enable rapid transition from transport to operation.  The system must provide full operational capability within 90 seconds (required) from initial turn-on. An initial turn-on time of less than or equal to10 seconds is desired.

The man portable combat system shall facilitate rapid repair utilizing a modular system, which enables rapid removal and replacement of faulty components.  Components shall be repairable within the USMC CLS programs currently in support of the MAGTF.
The device will be sufficiently ruggedized to withstand and/or be protected from the abrasive effects (e.g. pitting and scratching) and the penetration of blowing sand and dust particles while operating. The design of the system should also prohibit the penetration of water, moisture, condensation, and salt spray.

In an effort to meet Marine Corps short term and long-term objectives Marine Corps Systems Command is considering incremental development of this capability.  Increment one would enable FY08-09 IOC. Capabilities to be delivered in this increment should be a fully integrated Net-Centric C2 system, and an integrated modular open architecture man portable weapon and sensor package. It is the Marine Corps’ desire to field the new man portable combat system at a cost below the currently fielded weapon.  Responses to this RFI should include an approximate cost per engagement for each system recommendation and a top-level breakdown of how that cost projection was derived.

It is also desired that the man portable combat system facilitate future growth so that follow-on increments can be developed to engage other threats such as tanks, high-performance jet aircraft, and cruise missiles.  The ability to employ existing missiles (Javelin, Predator, SMAW) with the man portable combat system’s sensor package will maximize the system’s utility and flexibility on the battlefield. All interested companies are invited to participate.  This will provide industry a valuable opportunity for input, questions, and answers.  Time is available for one-on-one exchanges between a contractor and the Government team during 17 through 20 August 2004, to discuss the contractor's approach towards this concept and address questions on potential capabilities, (contractor to provide in writing and softcopy in MSWORD 6.0). All additional contractor briefings (to include capabilities briefings) will be limited to issues related to the development of the man portable combat system capabilities. Due to the limited time, the meetings will be set up on a first-come-first-served basis. Participation is limited to 5 industry representatives per meeting. Other exchanges may take place at a later date. These meetings will take place at the Research Center at Quantico Marine Corps Base.  To set up appointments for the one-on-one exchanges, please call Valerie Mosqueira at (703) 432-4192 or send email to Valerie Mosqueira at mosqueiravj@mcsc.usmc.mil; subject 1-on-1 exchanges not later than 16 Aug  2004.  Confirmation will be sent via e-mail and will include directions and points of contact for assistance. The meeting will be unclassified. No acquisition strategy will be discussed. Participation is totally voluntary, and the government will not reimburse the attendees for any cost associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this event. The short-term solution minimum capabilities we are looking for are ground to air, ground-to-ground, net centric, man portability.

Please reference SD41-08-04 in any response.	Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below. Purpose of RFI:  To solicit information critical in the establishment of a future RFQ and subsequent IDIQ type contract for materials testing capabilities. Introduction:  NASA’s Exploration Systems Mission Directorate in concert with other major enterprises within the agency such as the Office of Space Flight (Code M), Office of the Chief Medical Officer (Code Z), NASA Centers, National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council, National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI), and other extramural partners, created the Bioastronautics Critical Path Roadmap (BCPR) to identify major risks in the conduct of human exploration of space.  Radiation Protection is identified as a major risk for missions outside of LEO and is chronicled in the BCPR under Risks 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35.   At the request of NASA for a review of its biomedical research program, the National Research Council recommended that “major emphasis should be given to determining the types and thicknesses of shielding necessary to reduce astronaut risks to acceptable levels.” Further, the Council, in a separate report, advises that higher priority research should “determine how the selection and design of the space vehicle affect the radiation environment in which the crew has to exist.” These are the goals of the One NASA Space Radiation Shielding Program (SRSP), and this specific area of interest addresses research activities that enable the execution of human space exploration. The SRSP is a multi-center, agency-wide research program comprised of research scientists and engineers from a wide cross section of industry, academia, other federal agencies, and national laboratories. SRSP is concerned chiefly with the identification, design, testing, and qualification of new and innovative shielding materials that are fit to meet the exploration challenge in deep space and on planetary surfaces.  These new materials will encompass a broad spectrum of applications and mission scenarios including, but not limited to, spacecraft cladding, safe havens, habitats, EVA suits, advanced TPS materials and other applications involving material coverings of the habitable mission construct.   The SRSP is charged with maturing such candidate radiation shielding materials at the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 to TRL levels 5 or 6. This maturation will be accomplished on materials that are selected based on their radiation shielding properties as recommended through SRSP processes. Between two to three materials per year will be selected, and a series of materials tests, i.e, mechanical, chemical, thermal, will be conducted based on environments (deep space), structural component testing, and specific application design requirements. All data generated will go into the Materials and Processes Technical Information System II (MAPTIS II) database so that it can be shared. The materials maturation project as described will provide a database of material properties for selected multifunctional radiation shielding material systems that support space exploration in the areas of space vehicle and habitat design. Candidate materials include polyethylene, select fiber-reinforced polymer composites, and high-strength polymers that contain high concentrations of hydrogen, carbon, and boron.  The initial focus of the effort will be primarily the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), lunar habitats and EVA suits as precursors to a mission to mars. Experience:  Each respondent is asked to share the requisite experience base necessary to successfully execute an IDIQ materials testing effort for the NASA in order to document and control a materials space qualification effort. List of Required Testing Capabilities:	The respondent needs to define the list of tests required to achieve space flight qualification of materials to be utilized in four major mission scenarios:  1) Transit to Moon/Mars, 2) Lunar Planetary Operations, 3) Mars Planetary Operations and 4) Ascent/Descent to/from LEO.  The following is a partial listing of testing anticipated to support such multi-mission qualification requirements: 1) Define the mechanical properties for the new material in different mission environments such as Tensile testing at low, ambient, and high temperatures per ASTM D638. 2) Define the physical properties for the new material including thermal and electrical conductivity and coefficient of thermal expansion such as Thermal Conductivity testing per ASTM-D5930, Electrical Conductivity per JIS-H-0505, and Coefficient of Thermal Expansion testing per ASTM-D3386. 3) Define testing necessary to satisfy NASA safety standards and requirements such as the following: a)	Flammability testing per Section 4.1 and 4.2 of NASA-STD-6001 b)	Offgassing Determination testing per Section 4.7 of NASA-STD-6001 c)	Mechanical Impact testing per Section 4.13 and 4.14 of NASA-STD-6001 d)	Arc Tracking testing per Section 4.7 of NASA-STD-6001 e)	Fluids Reactivity testing per Section 4.15 of NASA-STD-6001 f)	Odor Assessment testing per Section 4.6 of NASA-STD-6001 4)  Define the adhesive characteristics of the new material with other materials including bonding and joining capabilities such as ASTM-D897, Standard Test Method for Tensile Properties of Adhesive Bonds. This section of the RFI is critical to the success of the anticipated procurement of an IDIQ materials testing effort as it will define the finite listing of tests to be acquired and whether some of the tests will be “government furnished.”	As such, the respondent is asked to provide a listing of the appropriate tests, their capabilities to perform such tests, what sample size would be required to achieve a statistically significant result for space flight, cost range per sample of such testing and the time period including preliminary and post test documentation required for performance of the test. Other:	List any other factors critical to the NASA achieving high quality results, economy and efficiency in operations or any other aspects of value to this government program.

<SUBJECT>R -- Modeling US Age Specific Mortality through Historical Data and Time Series Methods
<DESC>This is for informational purposes only. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the University of Maryland, College Park MD 20742. 
The purpose of the purchase order will be to Model US Age-Specific Mortality through Historical Data and Time Series
Methods.  The suggsted contractor and Benjamin Kedem, Ph.D will be collaborating on this effort. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Has collected vital statistics on the US population for more than 50 years.  Because of high variability for  some causes of death production of age-specific mortality in demographic subdomains are not easily
 computed directly from available data.  Parametric modeling of age-specific mortality in demographic subpopoulations will benefit many practical areas including public health and social economics.  Lee and Carter’s (LC) model incorporated time series components as factors of random drift when forecasting US
 mortality from 1990 to 2065.  As evaluated by using updated data, the LC method has been appreciated and improved by researchers.  This project is proposed to model mortality in demographic groups by 50 US states and the District of Columbia using NCHS mortality data.  US mortality data with state
 information from 1968 to the present are available for this research.  Mortality patterns will be studied with all current and historical data based upon the LC fundamental work.
extensions and modifications to these methods will be explored and evaluated.  The methodology will also be studied for possible improvements using Bayesian approaches.  Results from this project will be used in further research and in applications at
the NCHS and in public health nationally and internationally.  One application in NCHS is to assist in constructing decennial State life tables.  OBJECTIVE:  (1) Model age-sex specific mortality for each state for selected demographic sub domains (2) extend the work of Lee and Carter; evaluate extensions (3) Investigate Bayesian approaches for improvement (4) Assist in preparing specifications for use in applications at NCHS.  It is believed that the items and services procured from this vendor meets the minimum needs of the government and no other source for this equipment is known at this time. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All vendors are required to be registered in the
Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of a Federal contract. The preferred method for completing registration is via the World Wide Web at http://www.ccr.gov/.   A handbook and other
 information are available at the site, including information on how to obtain a DUNS number, which is required to begin the registration process.  This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive
 proposals. The government will consider all proposals received by 8:30 AM, EST, Tuesday, August 17, The proposal shall be clearly marked with the RFQ Number 2004-Q-01578. A determination

<SUBJECT>R -- Spatio-Temporal Models for Rapid Detection of Disease Outbreaks
<DESC>This is for informational purposes only.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in conjuction with the National Center for Health Statics, in Hyattsville MD, is intending to issue a sole source purchase order to the Stoffer Consulting, 5805 Elgin St, Pittsburgh, PA, 15206.  The suggested vendor will provide a
Spatio-Temporal Models for Rapid Detection of Disease Outbreaks.  Background Information:
Real-time disease surveillance is essential in helping detect the presence of a disease outbreak, and in supporting the characterization of that outbreak by a public health official.  Although data is being collected in “real-time” by various entities (such as the CDC, and RODS, the national data system for collecting data on disease symptoms under study at the University of Pittsburgh, to mention a few), data analytic tools that support both temporal and spatial data analysis and visualization are sorely lacking.  At the present time, most analyses are accomplished by dropping (either by ignoring or by aggregating) either time or space.  An outbreak which occurs in one location can be transmitted to populations located elsewhere either deliberately or by persons who are unaware of (or insensitive to) their disease exposure and status. Assessment of the potential for the spreading of a disease may be accomplished by conducting a complete census of the population at the location of origination or by sampling that population and employing adaptive sampling procedures.  Once the sampling has been accomplished, methods for analyzing the data in both space and time must be developed.  This work will focus either on the spatio-temporal analysis of CDC morbidity data, e.g., as presented on the CDC Data and Statistics web site: http://www.cdc.gov/scientific.htm,  or if necessary, on simulated data.  For example, simulations based on the SARS outbreak might be employed for developing an appropriate tool.   The objectives of the purchase order will be (1)  Assess the current state of the art of spatio-temporal statistical analysis.  (2) Develop a tool for the rapid detection of outbreaks.  (3) Develop a general model for the rapid analysis of spatio-temporal outbreak data. (4) Create a document that addresses the statistical analysis of spatio-temporal outbreak data and detection of outbreaks. It is believed that the items and services procured from this vendor meets the minimum needs of the  government and no other source for this service is known at this time.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, Subpart 13.106 and Subpart 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Request for Quotation number HSFEHQ-04-Q-0072 shall be referenced on any quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect thru Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.  This procurement is being solicited on a total small business set-aside basis.  The NAICS and small business size standard for this project are: 519190/$6.0 million.  Only one award will result from this solicitation, via the issuance of a fixed price purchase order.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Office of Public Affairs (OPA), requires access to an online electronic distribution system in order to provide communications to targeted media, congressional members and specific distribution groups.  The system should be easily accessible 24/7 via the internet from a variety of locations.  BACKGROUND:  FEMA’s Office of Public Affairs is responsible for the effective dissemination of accurate information to the public concerning FEMA’s programs, missions and goals for emergency management.  OPA provides primary support to the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response, with lead responsibility for the communication of agency goals, objectives and accomplishments.  In addition, OPA is responsible for the preparation and execution of plans and procedures for effectively informing the public about critical response and recovery information before, during and after natural disasters and emergencies.   GENERAL ANTICIPATED USE:  FEMA’s OPA and Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) typically distributes 1-2 page advisories, releases and fact sheets to targeted members of the media and Congress on a regular basis.  Development and distribution of information is generated at FEMA’s headquarters in Washington, DC; FEMA’s ten regional offices located throughout the country; and in FEMA’s disaster field offices located in presidentially declared disaster areas.  DELIVERABLES: 	1)  The Contractor shall provide online access to designated users that is accessible from multiple locations.  It is preferred that no special equipment or software be required for access and use of the system.  2)  The Contractor shall provide access to contact information for print and broadcast media, as well as congressional members and staff, including congressional committees.  This contact information shall be regularly updated and maintained by the Contractor to ensure accuracy.  It is preferred that the system will allow frequently used distribution lists to be created and saved for repeat use.  An additional preference is to capture the history of contact and document distribution to each contact within the online system.  3)  The Contractor shall provide the ability to target distribution to distinct groups from the general contact database including the ability to target distribution by geographic locale, circulation, audience, outlet type (print, radio, broadcast, web), editorial interest or beat, city, county, state, and congressional district.  In addition, the contractor shall provide capability to include additional internal and external contacts not included in the media or congressional database for distribution purposes as provided by FEMA.  4)  The Contractor shall provide a means of back up access to the distribution system in the event internet access is unavailable.  Actual use of the back up method is expected to be minimal and likely will be limited to instances where a field office is in process of establishing internet access.  5)  The Contractor shall provide for the distribution of documents to contacts to be received via fax or email in a timely and expeditious manner, including providing the ability to send approximately 61,250 pages per month, estimated by current distribution averages of 350 documents per month of an average 1.75 pages to 100 contacts per distribution.  6)  The Contractor shall provide for a minimum of 20 users to access the system on a regular basis.  These users shall consist of permanent, full time FEMA staff located in FEMA’s headquarters and regional offices.  7)  The Contractor shall provide the ability for FEMA to assign additional access accounts on a temporary basis to field officers for specific disaster use.  The number of temporary accounts is expected to average 8-10, but is not expected to be no more than 20 at any given time.  8)  The Contractor shall provide FEMA the ability to enter a project/billing code for each distribution in order to facilitate internal bill coding and invoice processing.  9)  The Contractor shall provide reporting capability that includes the ability to identify successful and unsuccessful delivery to designated contacts direct to the user initiating the distribution, as well as a monthly report to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) detailing usage volume, success rate of delivery, and other pertinent information.  10)  The Contractor shall also provide monthly reports and invoicing to the COTR detailing use and costs broken down by billing codes.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  One year from date of award, plus three (3) option years.  BASIS FOR AWARD:  The Government will make award to the responsive, responsible firm, whose quotation is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS -

QUESTION -  For each session, when would be have access to the government laptops and how much lead time would we have to install and set up each laptop for class.  Would be using the same laptops for all sessions?  Would we need to re-set the laptops for each session? 
 
ANSWER -  We do not want any software or files loaded on the government laptops.
 
Most laptops are used to access the command network and have a network
generated profile which means that the users typically do not have admin access on 
the laptops to load software.  Also, the government cannot guarantee disk space for 
loading software.
 
The intent of the laptops is for use as a remote desktop terminal to access
a virtual desktop on the vendor's server that is preconfigured for the training class.
The vendor is expected to host a totally preconfigured training environment.
 
The only communication between the vendors server and the government laptop 
will be through "Remote Desktop".
