<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is a research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Division is the world's most comprehensive cancer epidemiology research group. Its renowned epidemiologists, geneticists, and biostatisticians conduct population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. The Division's research impacts public health policy in the United States and around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">NCI is conducting a study within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial to evaluate the association between DNA methylation levels at chromosome 8q24 in peripheral blood and prostate cancer risk. The proposed contractor will carry out the laboratory analysis to measure DNA methylation using pyrosequencing.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Next, the NCI <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics</span> previously contacted several companies to develop and validate targeted pyrosequencing assays to quantify DNA methylation levels at 8q24. However, only EpigenDx Inc was willing and able to provide services using the pyrosequencing method, which is a high-throughput, quantitative method that is considered highly reproducible and sensitive to quantify differences in DNA methylation between individuals. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">NCI proposes to continue to work with EpigenDx in the current proposed study because EpigenDx has already developed the needed pyrosequencing assays that NCI needs for this project, whereas if we were to work with another lab, then we would need to duplicate our previous pilot effort by re-developing the assays with the other lab and retesting assay validity and reproducibility before proceeding with the current study of DNA methylation at 8q24 and prostate cancer risk. We would also like to work with EpigenDx because EpigenDx has the capacity to complete the responsibilities requested within the timeframe specified and at a reasonable price. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">A sole source is intended for this order, based on the fact that EpigenDX has already developed </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">pyrosequencing assays in previous pilot projects with NCI.

<DESC>The S.O. Conte Anadramous Fish Research Center, Turners Falls, MA has a requirement to repair a concrete sidewalk that is proposed is to excavate the area underneath the sidewalk section in front of the door to a depth below the frost line and provide compactable aggregate to allow better water infiltration. A new  sidewalk section will be poured on top of this gravel bed. The adjacent valve cluster will be excavated and rough aggregate used as ground cover. A trench will be excavated and a swale created along the entire length of the sidewalk with a perforated drain pipe installed and encased in aggregate. The roof drain will be connected to a solid drain pipe and routed under the sidewalk .Both drain pipes will enter an additional trench and routed to the adjacent catch basin. The concrete catch basin will be drilled to accommodate the drain lines. A new concrete slab will be poured and finished in front of the door. Finally the trench areas will be covered with screened loam and seeded.

<p>NOAA/NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE<br />SOUTHWEST FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER<br />FISHERIES RESOURCES DIVISION</p>
<p>Performance Period: Estimated: August 01, 2014 through January 09, 2016</p>
<p>I. Introduction<br />Seriola species have traditionally been a major component of global commercial and recreational fisheries and in recent years aquaculture value of these fish has grown into a ~$1.3 billion industry. The California yellowtail (Seriola lalandi) is a strong candidate for development of offshore commercial aquaculture in southern California and neighboring Baja California. Although artificial propagation and production from broodstock populations have been successful, the number of juveniles produced has not yet reached a sustainable level where it can satisfy the aquaculture demand. This is driven primarily by highly variable rates of various deformities, growth rate, and swim bladder inflation. As southern California is at the northern range of the species, it's likely that culture of this species would greatly benefit from identifying locally selected traits to improve broodstock selection.</p>
<p>II. Background</p>
<p>Genetic resources have been developed and used extensively in agriculture and livestock breeding for decades to improve product quality and quantity and more recently these approaches have been applied to a handful of aquaculture species (e.g. salmon, tilapia). Modern genetic approaches extend beyond parentage or family-based analyses to entire genome sequencing, gene expression, targeting of gene variants, and marker-assisted selection. These techniques have the potential to rapidly improve broodstock selection, characterize variation (both beneficial and detrimental), and provide methods to improve production in targeted species.</p>
<p>To address the lack of genetic resources available for S. lalandi we have assembled a high-quality draft genome and are exploring early developmental gene expression. To build upon our success and generate additional genetic resources to address key difficulties in Seriola aquaculture, we propose to use next generation sequencing to identify genomic regions linked to sex determination while simultaneously screening wild diversity for signatures of local selection that may be linked to traits of interest (e.g. cold tolerance, growth rate). Through identification of these markers we will assemble a toolkit by which hatchery facilities can selectively identify broodstock that possess the traits of interest. A sex-linked marker would not only allow minimally invasive sex determination for broodstock selection but also allow monitoring of effects of experimental manipulation (e.g. hormonal treatment) to manipulate sex ratios to improve growth rate. The identification of locally adapted traits will improve efficiencies of culture both through lowered costs for thermal manipulation of broodstock tanks (yearround spawning induction) as well as through optimizing growth and feed conversion rates through selection of individuals best adapted to local oceanographic conditions.</p>
<p>Developing genetic resources and tools are necessary steps for making broodstock-based aquaculture of S. lalandi sustainable and profitable. The genetic resources developed by the proposed project will be made available to aquaculture facilities to guide their broodstock selection. As such techniques have proven very useful in agriculture we feel there is great potential to rapidly improve culture practices for yellowtail through increased value and efficiency.</p>
<p>III. Description of Work and Services</p>
<p>Task 1. Next Generation DNA Sequencing</p>
<p>This task entails the sequencing of 90 Seriola lalandi male and female samples taken from three locations. The sequencing will utilize the Illumina platform, which was also used in the sequencing of the S. lalandi genome. Sequencing of these samples will include generation of 90 indices (one for each sample), and four lanes of HiSeq 100bp paired-end sequencing. Costs associated with the sequencing incorporate both materials and labor. <br /><br />Task 2. Bioinformatics support<br />Under this task, bioinformatics support will be used to align sequencing data from the 90 fish to the existing S. lalandi genome. The support will also be used to identify variation among the samples (e.g., SNPs and InDels). Advanced bioinformatics analyses will help to identify molecular markers that may reveal (or are associated with) the sex-determining region in Seriola lalandi, and identify molecular markers that are strongly associated with and can discriminate between the 3 geographic locations and potentially identify locally important variation. Any markers or regions identified through these analyses will be incorporated into the Seriola lalandi Genome Browser.<br /><br />IV. Deliverables<br />The contractor will complete the following projects and deliver them to the project leader no later than January 9, 2016. The duration of the contractor's performance period is based on: the availability of samples to submit for sequencing, the sequencing processing time, the number of hours of bioinformatics support, and availability of CPU processing time.</p>
<p>Task 1. Next generation sequencing of 90 S. lalandi samples.</p>
<p>Task 2. Alignment of the sequencing reads to the existing S. lalandi genome.</p>
<p>Task 3. Identification of molecular markers/regions related to variation in sex or geographic region.</p>
<p>Task 4. Marker development for sex-determination, traits of interest, and geographic variation.</p>
<p>Task 5. Incorporating these markers or elements into the Genome Browser for Seriola lalandi.</p>
<p>Task 6. Depositing the data into the appropriate public databases after submission of manuscripts.</p>
<p>V. Non-Personal Service Contract Statement<br />Contractor employees performing services under this order will be controlled, directed and supervised at all times by management personnel of the contractor. Contractor employees will perform independent of and without the supervision of any Government official. Actions of contractor employees may not be interpreted or implemented in any manner that results in any contractor employee creating or modifying Federal policy, obligating the appropriated funds of the U.S. Government, overseeing the work of Federal employees, providing direct personal services to any Federal employee or otherwise violating the prohibitions set forth in Parts 7.5 and 37.1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The Government will perform the inspection and acceptance of the completed work.</p>

<DESC>The S.O. Conte Anadramous Fish Research Center, Turners Falls, MA has a requirement to repair a concrete sidewalk that is proposed is to excavate the area underneath the sidewalk section in front of the door to a depth below the frost line and provide compactable aggregate to allow better water infiltration. A new  sidewalk section will be poured on top of this gravel bed. The adjacent valve cluster will be excavated and rough aggregate used as ground cover. A trench will be excavated and a swale created along the entire length of the sidewalk with a perforated drain pipe installed and encased in aggregate. The roof drain will be connected to a solid drain pipe and routed under the sidewalk .Both drain pipes will enter an additional trench and routed to the adjacent catch basin. The concrete catch basin will be drilled to accommodate the drain lines. A new concrete slab will be poured and finished in front of the door. Finally the trench areas will be covered with screened loam and seeded.
