<DESC>The Government is contemplating contract award of solicitation W914NS-04-R-9024 on a sole source basis to Diplomatic Freight Services (DFS).  The cited authority for this contemplated action is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Needs. The contemplated period of performance is 13 September 2004 through 12 September 2005.  The requirements of the solicitation are to provide base camp support services for phase II Emergency Response Unit (ERU) Training students at the Counter Terrorism Special Operation Training Facility (CTSOF), Baghdad, Iraq.  The phase II training adds approximately 300 students to the facility in need of life /camp support. DFS is currently performing base camp support services under DFI contract DABV01-04-C-0087, for phase I ERU students as well as dignitary protection students at the CTSOF.  This DFI contract has a period of performance for phase I ERU and dignitary protection training and force protection until 12 September 2005.  Since facilities are limited at CTSOF to one dining facility, one barber shop, one medical clinic etc., it is not possible for an additional base camp support service to be provided for the approximate 300 hundred students for phase II ERU by any contractor other than that providing ERU phase I and dignitary protection students base camp support services:  DFS.   This contemplated sole source contract to DFS will be coordinated to end at the same time as the phase I ERU and dignitary protection base camp support services DFI contract, awarded to DFS in a full and open competition environment.  At such time, the entire Counter Terrorism-Special Operations base camp support program, inclusive of phase I ERU, phase II ERU and dignitary protection training, will be re-solicited as full and open competition.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on the basis of technical, price, delivery, and past performance.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the quality and specification strength in the area of the Offeror’s technical proposal (offeror shall include detailed product description as specified above that highlights specifications and qualifications).  Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  The price will be considered, although of lesser importance than the technical proposal.  Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (include email address and phone number of references).  Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote.  The technical quote will be more significant than the price quotes.  However, price and past performance are of equal importance.  Offerors should also discuss whether they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1, Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract, with desired delivery 30 days after receipt of order.  The vendor must state actual delivery time in the offer.
