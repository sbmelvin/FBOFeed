<DESC>The Agency Of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration(SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services(CMHS)
through the Division of Acquisition Management(DAM),
Program Support Center(PSC), plans to award a 12 month contract
using simplified acquisition procedures to the National
Association of State Mental Health Directors.  The anticipated date of award is August 4, 2003.

The purpose of this technical assistance project is to broadly inform and infuse study findings into state mental health systems
practice on best emergent practices for working with women with co-occurring disorders and histories of violence who are dependent on the public mental health system for their services.  State mental health agencies serve as both gatekeepers for this system and at the same time can also serve as powerful champions for doing business in this new manner. Thus, they are the core constituent group to whom this project’s activities will be directed.

The Contractor shall compile findings from this study in
collaboration with the Women and Violence Coordinating Center
located at the Policy Research Associates, Inc. (PRA).

Work with SAMHSA to compile secondary findings not part of
the formal study protocols.

Translate findings into user-friendly guidelines for use by State mental health agencies that fund counties and other direct
providers.

Conduct activities to provide findings to stakeholders using mechanisms including, but not limited to, direct technical
assistance training, nationally distributed publications,
presentations at three national conferences and web-based resources. Focus on two priority areas: a) women in state hospitals; and b) women in jails.

Disseminate relevant findings to an advisory workgroup made
up of key national organizations including NAMI, NMHA, Bazelon
NAPHS, NCCBH, CWLA.

The scope of this proposal would include the hiring of a part time project coordinator who would be well versed in both clinical practice and in research into practice analysis and dissemination.  The coordinator would work under the direction of the Director of the Office of Technical Assistance at the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) with full collaboration with the NASMHPD Research Institute, Inc.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source
Under authority of Far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify
their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days
after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by
the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management Yuma Field Office has an emergency requirement to procure 35,000 individual trees of varying types (7 local varieties) in one-gallon stock containers.  The NAICS is 111421.  Place of performance is Yuma, AZ.  The value of procurement is $80,500.  Due to the urgency (Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation of the Mittry North Burned Area) and unique nature of the requirement (local genetics only) and based on the market research conducted by the requiring office, the Bureau of Land Management Yuma Field Office has prudently decided that it is in the best interest of the government to procure the needed trees from Camelot Nurseries, Inc. dba Mountain States Wholesale Nursery of Phoenix, Arizona.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Three Dimensional (3-D) Electronics.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Three dimensional (3-D) integrated circuits offer significant performance benefits over two dimensional (2-D) integrated circuits based on the electrical and mechanical properties arising from the new geometrical arrangement.  The goals of this initiative are to develop a robust 3-D circuit technology through the development of advanced fabrication capabilities and the design tools needed to fully exploit this 3-D technology for producing high performance circuits.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas: 3-D integrated circuit process technology, and development and demonstration of Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools for integrated 3-dimensional (3-D) mixed signal circuits.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-25 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site - http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-03-25/ - has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  A web site - http://www.darpa.mil/mto/solicitations/BAA03-25/S/FAQ.html - has been established for frequently asked questions for this BAA.  The technical POC's for this effort are Daniel Radack (technical area one), FAX: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: dradack@darpa.mil; and Anantha Krishnan (technical area two), FAX:  (571) 218-4553, electronic mail: akrishnan@darpa.mil. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 03-25, Three Dimensional (3-D) Electronics, Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on Three Dimensional (3-D) Electronics, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  An original and seven (7) copies of the proposal abstract and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the abstract (in PDF (preferred), MS-Word readable, HTML, or ASCII format each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM) should be submitted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-25, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The proposal abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-25) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, August 15, 2003.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original and seven (7) copies of the full proposal and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF - preferred, MS-Word readable, HTML, or ASCII format, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-25, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-25) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, October 17, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-25 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only".  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in 3-D electronics. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.

The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 ($21 million). Once available, this solicitation must be downloaded from http://www.eps.gov, as NO paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the solicitation. The government contemplates award on or about 01 October 2003, with a performance start date of 01 January 2004.  The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as preliminary information and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. The “DRAFT” Statement of Work (SOW) is attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) the POC listed below.

<DESC>Contractor to furnish all labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, materials, and other incidentals, work includes but is not limited to:install an electrically powered gate for the main wareyard to be operated by keypads and/or card readers situated on both sides of the wareyard fence.  These card reader/keypads must be compatible with, or (if initially installed as keypads only) convertible to operate using, the standard, government "smart card."  This single-panel, powered gate will replace the current double-panel, manual gate located at the northeast corner of the wareyard fence, and will be the same width and height as the existing gate.  The government will approve final placement of these reader/keypads.  The gate mechanism must include a V-track channel, or other apparatus, to ensure reliable tracking and control of the gate.  Additionally, the gate must have appropriate hardware to prevent lifting, pulling or pushing the gate panel from the track.  Safety features, such as an inductive loop in the asphalt and a contact sensor on the sliding panel, are necessary to cancel closure of the gate if personnel or vehicles have not cleared the gate path.  The gate must include an automatic closure feature, on an adjustable delay, that allows a vehicle to pass through the gate prior to its closing, and without stopping to re-close the gate.  It should include a nightlight for safety and security.  The gate should move to the south (to avoid the dirt road the on the north, behind the wareyard perimeter fence--a safety feature for the gate itself).  To add gate movement limit switches to the personnel safety and gate-edge contact sensor.   Location:  The Field Office is located at 620 E. Greene, Carlsbad, NM. East Greene is US Highway 62/180.  The office is at the east edge of the city and in an area lacking significant traffic or other urban activity after normal business hours. Work Data Sheet: Designates the type and quantity of work required at each project location, and dimensions required for typical drawings. The Project is estimated between $15,000 and $50,000.

<DESC>A--BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE ARCHITECTURE STUDY SOL OFA-GOES-R-3-0001; POC Jay W. Moore, NOAA Contracting Officer, telephone 301-713-4751 This notice is for a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) within the context of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 35.016. White Papers submitted in response to this BAA must be received not later than 1600 local time on 8 August 2003 at the following address: U.S. DOC, NOAA, NESDIS, (ATTN:  Jay W. Moore), 8455 Colesville Road, Suite 1450, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3315.  White Papers should reference BAA OFA-GOES-R-3-0001 and should be addressed to the attention of Jay W. Moore. Respondents are directed to notify the Contracting Officer of their intent to respond by sending an email to jay.moore@noaa.gov.  RESPONDENTS MUST GO TO THE FOLLOWING SITE TO DOWNLOAD THE TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION FOR THIS BAA:   http://www.osd.noaa.gov/goesr_arch_study/index.htm .  White Papers must be submitted in an original and ten (10) copies. Written format: All White Papers shall use clear, readable, single-spaced type on 8 ½" x 11" paper, single-sided, unless using charts, which are encouraged where they can be appropriately used to convey approaches and methods.  It is preferable that material be presented using a 10-point font size.  Use of a 12-point proportionately based font is also acceptable.  Also submit all files in .pdf format.  The White Paper must not exceed twenty-five (25) pages of narrative and charts for a single task area proposal or fifty (50) pages of narrative and charts for a multiple task proposal. For further detail, refer to paragraph 2.6 of the Technical Description provided on the NOAA webpage listed below.  Failure of any Respondent to follow these instructions shall lead to omission of information from consideration by the peer review panel, and shall be construed by the Government as the Respondent having made this exclusion purposefully.  This BAA is open to commercial industry, academic institutions, and other interested parties.  It is being sought to solicit alternative architectural concepts for an end-to-end, integrated, remote sensing observing system and data services for GOES-R.  The U.S. Government (USG) Department of Commerce’s (DOC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) primary mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth’s environment, and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation’s economic, social, and environmental needs.  This mission requires a continuous capability to process, archive and disseminate environmental information to central processing centers and distributed direct users.  This information is acquired and distributed on an extensive spatial range (global, regional and local) within a variety of time scales (minutes to days).  This information includes, but is not limited to: hemispheric imagery; cloud and precipitation parameters; atmospheric profiles of temperature, moisture, wind, aerosols and ozone; surface conditions concerning ice, snow and vegetation; ocean parameters of sea temperature, color and state; solar conditions and in-situ space environment.  These data are critically needed for 1) severe storm and flood warnings; 2) tropical cyclone (hurricane reconnaissance and warnings); 3) hydrologic forecasts and water resources management; 4) ocean surface and internal structures forecasts; 5) medium range forecast outlook (out to fifteen days); 6) solar and space environmental forecasts; 7) aviation forecasts (domestic, military, and international); 8) ice conditions forecasts; 9) seasonal and inter-annual climate forecasts; 10) decadal-scale monitoring of climate variability; 11) long-term global environmental change assessment; 12) environmental air quality monitoring and emergency response; 13) fire and volcanic eruption detection and analysis; and 14) short-term and mesoscale forecasts.  To meet requirements and accomplish NOAA’s mission, the current geostationary satellite systems perform three major functions: (1) ENVIRONMENTAL SENSING: Acquisition, generation and dissemination of atmospheric imaging and sounding data, solar and space environment (in-situ) data, land and ocean surface data. (2) DATA COLLECTION:  Interrogation and receipt of data from Earth surface-based data collection platforms and relay to the NOAA command and data acquisition stations.  (3) DATA BROADCAST:  Continuous relay of meteorological data to distributed users, independent of other system functions and relay of distress signals from aircraft or marine vessels to search and rescue ground stations.  Historically, the ground systems associated with the geostationary satellites, which perform the data and product processing, distribution, archive and user interface functions have been addressed independently from the satellites.  In the future, proposed systems need not be unique to GOES-R and may be components of existing or future over-arching (higher level) operational systems within NOAA.  For example, new and/or upgraded capabilities required for enhanced GOES-R series functions in the areas of product generation, distribution networks, and archive facilities must be identified, planned, budgeted, and implemented.  To effectively and efficiently meet the GOES-R system requirements, a complete end-to-end (data sensing to information access) approach must be adopted.  In addition, the architecture concepts must maintain compatibility with all heritage satellite meteorological information collection needs and existing interfaces.  As a result, the end-to-end GOES-R architecture must define interfaces internal within the GOES-R system and external to the appropriate NESDIS systems.  The Government desires to research complete end-to-end system architecture options that assess the infusion of new or existing technologies that may enhance performance and reduce costs.  Respondents are encouraged to propose innovative methods to meet the performance requirements and provide cost benefits.  However, it is recognized that potential Respondents may not have the capability or desire to research and address the complete end-to-end architecture.  Therefore, Respondents may choose to propose one or more of the following Task Areas:  Task Area 1:  Space and Launch Segments; Task Area 2:  Command, Control and Communications (C3) Segments; Task Area 3:  Production Generation and Distribution, Archive and Access, and User Interface Segments; Task Area 4:  End-to-End System Integration; Respondent’s can only submit one proposal comprised of either a single task or multiple tasks.  The Government requires a White Paper detailing the conceptual architecture concepts, advanced state of the art technology studies involved, and past performance information demonstrating Respondent’s capability to perform the Task Area(s) that they are proposing.  This capability demonstration must include a description of the Respondent’s past experience in developing GOES systems or similar/like systems, identifying the contract, a current reference person and phone number, and the Respondent’s role in the performance of said contract(s).  The Respondent must identify feasible architectures that will advance R&D studies, or enhance NOAA’s mission capabilities or its interests in the GOES-R System, and identify past capabilities.  The Government’s Technical Description, notional GOES R architecture, and other supporting documents are online at: ftp://ftp.osd.noaa.gov/Goes-R/.  NASA also maintains a site at, http://goes2.gsfc.nasa.gov/goesr_industry.htm.  The requesting office intends to rank the responses using a panel of experts known as the NOAA/NASA Peer Review Panel (hereafter, the “Panel”).  The Panel ranking will be based upon 1) Respondent’s experience on similar missions; 2) Respondent’s current capability, evidenced by its corporate, research, and industrial resources to produce the GOES-R system or portions of the system corresponding to the Task Area(s) the Respondent is proposing; and, 3) how the research component of Respondent’s study plan will contribute to NOAA’s assessment of alternative architectures and advance the GOES-R mission.  The Panel will advise the selection official on the responses that offer demonstrated capability to perform the Task Area(s), and potentially innovative and feasible research opportunities that will advance the GOES-R mission.  The Government contemplates an award of multi-tiered study contracts in the Fall 2003.  It is anticipated that Tier 1 will consist of System Architecture Concepts, and Tier 2 of System Architecture Definition, which will provide additional definition and refinement to the initial study, such as additional Cost –as-an-Independent-Variable (CAIV) trades, risk identification, or other value-added details.  Respondents to this BAA are assured that the Government will protect their proprietary data.  Prior to the Government using this information, it will review with the Respondent use of their trade secret data.   NON-RESPONSE TO THIS BAA WILL NOT PRECLUDE FUTURE COMPETITION FOR ANY ENSUING SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS. NOAA anticipates awarding several Study contracts.  The anticipated value of the Tier 1 Task Areas are: (1) Task Area 1 - $1.0M, (2) Task Area 2 - $0.5M, (3) Task Area 3 - $0.5M, and (4) Task Area 4 - $0.5M over an approximately 12-month effort. No Respondent will be paid for the same work more than once.  Respondents are advised that the Government may secure the following consultants to provide supporting analyses on the Respondents’ White Papers or proposals, for purposes of including a non-biased, third-party assessment from experts in the respective fields of satellite systems, engineering, and communications, and ground systems: The Aerospace Corporation; Veridian, Inc.; MIT Lincoln Labs; The MITRE Corporation; MitreTEK; Swales Aerospace; Tecolote, QSS, and User Technology Associates. These organizations will sign and submit non-disclosure and organizational conflict of interest certifications to the Government in anticipation of these proposed analyses. These consultants will not, however, score any White Papers or proposals.  Access to your White Papers shall be handled under the FAR, Part 3.104, and 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), to protect any specified confidential or proprietary business data. General information about the NOAA geostationary satellite program can be found at http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture for Supplemental Architect-Engineer / Interior Design Services for the Public Buildings Service (PBS) First Impressions Program and Related Services, Nationwide. Solicitation No. 
GS-00P-03-CYD-0113.  The First Impressions program is a collaboration of the GSA and other Federal Agencies.  Building on the success of the Design Excellence program for federal buildings, this program’s mission is to enhance the public’s perception of the GSA and the federal government by improving the appearance and efficiency of GSA buildings.  These buildings belong to the American public and exist to serve them.  Public architecture forms a meaningful image in our collective imagination.  Together, we can make it the best image possible; one of an efficient, effective, and professional government.  The factors that most influence visitors’ first impressions of the building include: the approach and immediate exteriors; building lobbies; elevator lobbies and corridors; elevators; stairs and escalators; agency entrances; and public concession areas.  Functional support and expertise for the First Impressions program will typically be in the areas of; transforming the building image; reducing clutter; consolidating functions; unifying signage; and streamlining security.  This procurement will establish Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts to provide design and related services for federal facilities; owned, leased and/or controlled, nationwide.  This contract is national in scope, supporting all existing and future federal and other types of real property.  Multiple A-E contracts may be awarded.   All work will be procured through the issuance of individual Work/Delivery Orders, each defined by a separate scope of work.  The term of the contracts shall be for one (1) base year period, followed by four (4) one-year option periods, not to exceed $7,500,000 for each Period, for an aggregate dollar value of $37,500,000.  The scope of the design A/E services may include, but not be limited to, the following:  pre-design programming, site survey and investigation, design security enhancements, space planning, plaza design, design programming, interior design, signage and graphics design, complete design services, computer aided design and drafting (CADD), working drawings, specifications, cost estimating, landscape design, design review, value engineering services, post construction contact services (PCCS) and other required supplemental services if so requested.  This is a request for Qualifications under Design Excellence. The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility to conceive the design concept and the building’s architecture.  The A/E firm must address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and project team in Stage II.  A/E firms are advised that this is a national contact and as such, projects may be located anywhere within the United States. The A-E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:  In STAGE I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8 ½” x 11” format.  The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the FBO announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; and modified Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project). Identification of consultants is not required at this stage.  The assembled Stage I portfolio should be no more than ½ inch thick. Project qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following EVALUATION CRITERIA:  1.  Past Performance of Design (35%) - The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five renovation projects completed in the last ten years.  Illustrations should document the before and after conditions for each of the selected projects.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section.  Images of the space before and after renovation should be clearly labeled.  (2)  Philosophy and Design Intent (25%) - In the Lead Designer’s words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her personal design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply in creating lobbies, plazas and other public spaces that are by their very nature imbued with political and national meaning.  (3) Lead Designer Profile (15%) - Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. 4. LEAD DESIGNER PORTFOLIO (25%) -  Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer’s ability to provide design excellence.

The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria (1), the Lead Designer will address his or her participation in the project.  An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and representatives of GSA will evaluate the submissions.  A geographically diverse group of firms will be sought.  The Board will establish a short-list of eight to twelve firms.  Stage II: , the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.  The firm will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  The Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project and project management.   Firms selected to participate in STAGE II will be further evaluated by an anonymous, one-day design charrette, judged by a jury of independent design professionals. The purpose of the design charrette is to further evaluate the A/E’s qualifications for the project.  The designer’s “vision” will weigh substantially in the selection of the A/E Teams by GSA.  The submitted design charrette concepts become the property of the Government. The design charrette proposals will be used in conjunction with Stage II rankings in the final evaluation of the A/E firms.  Stage II rankings will be used in conjunction with Stage I rankings to select the winning A/E Firm(s).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 339111   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with TSI, Inc., St. Paul, MN, for a low pressure cascade impactor to collect size fractionated fine particulate matter in 13 size fractions ranging from 10.26 micrometers to 0.030 micrometers aerodynamic diameter. This impactor for the ORD/NRMRL/APPCD in RTP, NC, is required for an experimental study which will utilize the impactor to determine the chemical composition of the particles by size.  Specifically, organic compounds comprising the particles will be thermally desorbed at temperatures up to 300  degrees C and sent directly to a gas chromatograph-mas spectrometer (GC/MS) for identification and quantitation.  Therefore, the required equipment must be capable of collecting the size-fractionated samples on substrates of a type (aluminum foil) and size (25 mm diameter).  The U.S. EPA believes  that only TSI can provide equipment which meets the above specifications.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing it can provide the required equipment may submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  The documentation must be submitted to the POC  within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to  conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 12.  The anticipated award date is August 5, 2003.  See numbered note 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate with Ionics, Incorporated of Bridgeville, PA on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a single source, for the purchase of an additional seven (7) Safety Shim Rods.  The original contract for seventeen (17) rods was with Ionics, Incorporated and the Government now has a need for an addition seven (7) Safety Shim Rods.  A general description of the Safety Shim Rods required is as follows: 1 inch thick by 5 inches wide and have active poison that is 52 1/4 inches long. The hollow interior is filled with helium and sealed and the cadmium is clad on the outside and inside surfaces with aluminum. The cladding of cadmium between two aluminum surfaces shall be without any gap and shall be in perfect contact. The hub section of the rod is made of aluminum plate. The 0.040 inch thick cadmium is in sheet form and is 99.95% pure. The safety shim rods are critical components of NIST nuclear reactor. The manufacture of these rods must follow strict quality control and quality assurance procedures. Certified materials per American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards must be used. Manufacture and testing shall be per ASME, AWS, MIL codes and standards and per 10 CFR 21.  Ionics is uniquely qualified to fulfill this requirement because Ionics developed the process in fabricating the shim rods that are custom made for NIST.  Ionics is currently in the process of fabricating the seventeen (17) Safety Shim Rods and has enough material to make the additional quantity of seven.  It would not be cost effective for the Government to acquire the additional seven (7) Safety Shim Rods from another source because a considerable amount of time and resources was required in developing the process in which to fabricate the Safety Shim Rods.  The delivery shall be made in February 2004 and the delivery shall be FOB Destination to Gaithersburg, Maryland.  The Government anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price purchase order utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes by July 18, 2003.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  For information, call the POC identified above.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357; Fax: 703-875-4009; email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  SUBMISSION PROPOSAL PLACE: Dr. Cristian Stapper, Executive Director, (CRA) Comisión de Regulación de Agua Potable y Saneamiento Básico, Carrera 7 No. 71-52, P. 14, Bogota, Colombia, Phone:  011-571-325-4820 Ext. 278, Fax:  011-571-317-0966; email: propuestastda@cra.gov.co The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance (TA) to the Colombian Comisión de Regulación de Agua Potable y Saneamiento Básico (CRA), in the assessment of the technical and financial viability of water/wastewater and regulatory reform projects.  

CRA is a Colombian state entity that supports sustainable development of public potable water and basic sanitation services. CRA was created in 1994 for the purpose of promoting competition and regulating monopolies, defining criteria for efficiency and development indicators to evaluate financial, technical and administrative initiatives, establishing tariff formulas and guidelines and examining/evaluating uniform conditions for public service contracts.  

At present, the Colombian water and wastewater sector is severely hampered by water service providers’ inability to charge and collect tariffs that cover the cost of investment, operations and maintenance.  Currently, 30 to 40 percent of the water supply in Colombia is not tracked under the present water usage monitoring system. To address this issue, CRA requested USTDA assistance in determining a strategy for reducing "lost and unaccounted for water" (LUFW) nationwide. The USTDA TA grant will fund the development of a strategy to reduce LUFW and will address the institutional reforms and tariff increases that are necessary to fund the recommended improvements.  Upon completion of the technical assistance, CRA intends to develop policy and regulations for Colombia's water service providers, thus leading to a significant savings from the estimated US$350-$500 million per year annual cost of the current LUFW problem. The objectives of the TA include:  1) Evaluation of the existing project conditions, related facilities and proposed service areas;  2) Performance of a technical review of the proposed project and develop design alternatives;  3)  Evaluation of effects of the proposed projects on current operations/staffing;  4)  Evaluation of capital and projected operations/maintenance costs for the project;  5)  Identify possible financing options for project implementation and make preliminary contacts with each proposed source; and, 6) Preparation of a written report summarizing findings, conclusions and recommendations.

The Terms of Reference for the TA include the following: 

Task 1. Evaluation of Potable Water Losses and Measuring Improvement for Colombia
Task 2.  Development of Design Parameters.
Task 3.  Development of Conceptual Design
Task 4.  Development of Budgetary Cost Estimate
Task 5.  Development of a Value of Water for Regulatory Revisions and Tariff Restructuring
Task 6.  Preparation of Environmental Review Documentation
Task 7.  Development of Project Financing Alternatives

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $482,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

IMPORTANT:  When submitting a proposal for this TA study, the bidder must be aware that the TA will require travel to Colombia.  

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitial mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, TEL: 703-875-4357; Fax: 703-875-4009; email: ekunene@tda.gov. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:   Mr. Traian Panait, Secretary of State, Ministry of Transport, Construction and Tourism, 38 Dinicu Golescu Building, 77113 Bucharest 1, Romania, Phone: +40 21 222 34 35, Fax: +40 21 212 66 94.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a comprehensive Security Master Plan for modernizing and restructuring the Romanian civil aviation security system.   

In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted a number of resolutions designed to ensure the safety of passengers, ground crew personnel, and the general public.  These resolutions have profound implications for the domestic civil aviation security programs of contracting states.  Many of the airports that are now currently operating throughout Romania have ineffective or non-existent perimeter fencing, insufficient quantities of equipment, and outdated resources essential for combating today’s high tech security threats.  In addition, much of the airport staff is unprepared to address airport security shortcomings. 

Significant steps need to be taken to ensure the safety and security of Romania’s airports.  As such, the Romanian Ministry of Transport, Construction and Tourism has requested assistance from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to help meet the country’s aviation security needs.  The civil aviation security assistance will evaluate current security policies and procedures, identify measures needed to comply with new ICAO standards, and develop an overall plan for modernizing and restructuring Romania’s civil aviation security system.

The assistance would establish specific program and technological requirements necessary to modernize the Romanian civil aviation security at all of the nation’s international airports.  Commencing with a vulnerability analysis, the contractor should conduct a needs assessment to ascertain and validate specific requirements and estimate capital and operating costs for surveillance, access control, explosives detection, communications, and command and control.  This assessment should include plans, programs, equipment, training, and maintenance.  Requirements developed may include, but are not limited to: the means of gathering and sharing threat information; acquisition, installation, and training of equipment, such as intrusion detection, ID systems, explosives detection systems, passenger and baggage X-ray and metal detector systems and; the design of security and crisis/contingency plans and exercises to include the development and presentation of an integrated national training program applicable to each airport.  The final product of the assistance would be a Security Master Plan with precise quantities and specifications of required goods and services.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $547,790 grant to the Grantee from the (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.

<DESC>The Program Support Center has a requirement for the Office of Womens Health (OWH), Department of Health and Human Services to support the development of a Womens Primary Health Care Survey Center to promote the assessment of womens access to primary disease prevention and health promotion services, especially minorities, in the United States.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston Salem, NC 27157 for the services of Dr. Roger Anderson, Associate Professor, Department of Public Health Sciences to conduct this effort.  The period of performance shall be one year from date of award and award shall be made utilizing FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures.  A collaborative group of health services researchers working with the OWH National Centers of Excellence in Womens Health (CoE) program developed an evaluation tool to assess quality of womens health care.  As a result of publications in scientific journals, considerable interest in this womens health evalution tool from academic and research centers has been received.  There is a need for a dedicated survey center to provide access to the survey package and resources to academic and non-academic primary health care centers through targeted advertisements, mailings, and survey support services to facilitate survey implementation.  Specifically, the contractor shall 1) advertise and disseminate the evaluation tool to primary care settings across the nation or by website free of charge; 2) provide assistance and protocols for data collection that include manuals and collection services using the established CoE Quantitative Evaluation Survey telephone survey group and expertise; and  3) maintain a depository of data by which the contractor shall pool, analyze and report findings.  The Survey Center shall provide de-identified benchmarking services to users of the survey so that scores may be interpreted as a percentile or ranking based upon the CoE program.  The contractor shall especially focus on building a database that may address public policy issues of womens health care equality by age, race/ethnicity, and region of country/locale.  Dr. Anderson is uniquely qualified to conduct this effort in as much as he served as Chair of the CoE Quantitative Evaluation Committee and head of the Data Coordinating Center for Clinical CoE Evaluation project and developed the study methods and procedures for evaluating womens healthcare centers based upon the survey.  He is a co-developer of the survey tool and has published works describing the instrument and development and outcomes.   Dr. Anderson has expertise in patient satisfaction benchmarking through his academic work at Wake Forest University School of Medicine as well as with national benchmarks of quality of care information through federally funded grants from the National Institute of Health and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.   Interested parties may submit a capability statement documenting their achievements and experience in similar endeavors.  No solicitation document is available.

<DESC>The Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Washington, 4245 Roosevelt Way, NE, Campus Box 354765, Seattle, WA 98105 to extend their National Center of Excellence (CoE) in Womens Health contract number 213-98-0016 for an additional year, October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004.  The contract was awarded in 1998 along with 5 other CoE contracts.  These were the 3rd generation of CoEs.  The National Centers of Excellence in Womens Health were designed to fill a critical need for the provision of state-of-the-art, comprehensive, culturally and linguistically appropriate, and integrated health care services targeted to the special needs of women, for the development of a multi-disciplinary research agenda on women’s health issues, and for enhanced public and health care professional education on women’s health issues.  This additional option period will continue to develop and evaluate comprehensive national model program(s), which focus on womens unique needs in the health care delivery system by providing both educational and clinical services to women, and development of multi-disciplinary research programs on womens health linking specialty areas, while reducing the Government funding for the CoE in an effort to make the CoE self sustaining in the future.  The additional option period has been justified in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(d).  This is not a request for proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Drug Evaluation Research (CDER) has a requirement to develop and evaluate an in vitro test protocol that is able to detect changes in manufacturing or formulation when Q1 and Q2 are the same or very similar. If possible a measure for Q3 can be proposed.  The FDA has used concepts of Q1, meaning qualitative similarity between generic and reference listed products, and Q2 representing quantitative similarity of composition. These two concepts are not sufficient to say that two products are the same. Thus, Q3 is introduced as a newly defined term that describes similarity of manufacturing process variables resulting in structural similarity and refers to the physical attributes and state of aggregation of the product. The duration of the project will be one year. RFQ available on or about 7/26/03.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service, Office of Coast Survey makes the nautical charts  for the U.S. to promote the safe and efficient use of the waterways.  At present, novice recreational boaters are not well served with an informational/navigational product.  NOAA intends to enter into agreements with contractors interested in making and distributing special purpose maps to fill the informational/navigational needs of novice boaters.

The special purpose map would be a physically attractive "impulse" purchase in the $3.00 to $5.00 price range.  It would contain a mix of nautical chart and safety information selected to educate novice boaters, and to improve their boating experience.  NOAA would define, gather the information for, and compile this special purpose map.  The selected contractor(s) would be granted authority to manufacture, sell, and distribute the resulting special purpose maps.      

The selected contractor(s) would operate independently, at their own risk and expense, meeting minimal terms and conditions described herein, and would be compensated for his effort from their sales of the product.  The contractor(s) will not receive funding from NOAA. Should contractors decide not to manufacture, sell, and distribute the special purpose maps compiled by NOAA, then the agreement would be without effect.


1. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES

A.	NOAA would:

1.	Design, provide data for, and compile special purpose maps intended for use by novice recreational boaters.
2.	Provide digital versions of said special purpose maps to contractor for use in printing copies of those maps.
3.	Where practicable, provide other data, updates to that data, information, and technical assistance that may be appropriate, or of use to the contractor in this venture.
4.	Establish standards of quality and service for the special purpose maps, their delivery, and related matters. 
5.	Continue for the duration of the contract to provide the data, information, and technical assistance that NOAA has led the contractor to depend on in the establishment of its commercial activity to provide the special purpose maps.
6.	Permit the use of the NOAA emblem on the special purpose maps according to NOAA's standards, and permit them to be presented as NOAA products or products endorsed by NOAA.
7.	Notwithstanding any provision herein, NOAA would retain legal responsibility for the correctness of the original data files and updates thereto which it provides to the contractor.
8.	Consider ideas for changes to the special purpose maps proposed by the contractor so as to improve the success of the product and this collaborative venture.
9.	Treat as proprietary any information so indicated and shared by the contractor in the performance of this venture.

B.	Contractor would:
1.	Manufacture the special purpose maps exactly as they are provided by NOAA and without modification.
2.	Adhere to the standards of quality and service for the special purpose maps, their delivery, and related matters as specified by NOAA.
3.	Manufacture and make a diligent effort to sell all of the special purpose maps provided, not merely those in areas popular with novice boaters.
4.	Use the digital files provided, and the information contained therein, only in the production of the special purpose maps, or for other purposes agreed to by NOAA.  
5.	Make clear in its representations the purposes for which the special purpose maps are suited, including those purposes identified by NOAA.
6.	Submit to NOAA for clearance all advertising, uses of the NOAA logo, and public claims.  Such clearance would not be unreasonably withheld.
7.	Limit the single copy, retail price of the special purpose maps (manufacturer's suggested retail price) when purchased over-the-counter to no more than five dollars ($5), or to another amount mutually agreeable to by the contractor and NOAA.
8.	Carry printer's errors and omissions insurance, or a comparable policy, in an amount reasonably appropriate for the product being sold.
9.	Have shown on every copy the following identifying information in a space to be specified by NOAA:  manufacturer's name, phone number, fax number (if any), e-mail address (if any).
10.	Indemnify and hold harmless the U.S. Government for any loss, claim, damage, or liability of any kind, to the extent cause by the negligence of itself or its employees, arising out of the use by the contractor, or any Party acting on its behalf or under its authorization.
11.	Acknowledge and accept that NOAA may enter into this or similar Agreements with multiple parties for identical or similar work.
12.	In the eventuality that the contractor decides to discontinue producing the special purpose maps, and is unable to provide an alternate approved supplier to its customers, the contractor would provide its customer list to NOAA without limitations or restrictions so that NOAA could make arrangements for the continued provision of the special purpose maps to those customers.
13.	Mark or otherwise indicate information that is to be treated as proprietary.


2. FUNDING AND REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS

The contractor would operate at its own risk and expense in meeting its responsibilities.  Compensation, if any, for its effort would come from sales of the maps by the contractor, and the contractor would not receive funds from NOAA.

In addition, the contractor would pay NOAA an amount equal to ten cents ($0.10) per copy manufactured towards the costs incurred by NOAA.  NOAA would operate at its own risk and expense, using annually appropriated funds, in meeting its responsibilities.  NOAA would recover a portion of its costs from the contractor as described in this section.

3. DURATION OF AGREEMENT

The duration of any resulting agreements would be two years.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the services of a contractor to provide an analysis of audits on taxpayer compliance in the Statement of Work entitled, ‘Estimating the Indirect Effect of Audits: An Experimental Approach’.  The Request for Proposals (RFP), TIRNO-03-R-00027 will be issued on or about JULY 14, 2003.  Proposals are due not later than 3:00 PM on Friday, August 15, 2003, at the address shown above.  Interested parties may obtain a copy of the Request for Proposals (RFP) from the IRS Procurement website: http://www.procurement.irs.treas.gov/  No telephone requests will be honored.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561440 and the corresponding small business size standard is $6,000,000.This is a commercial item acquisition conducted in accordance with the format in Subparts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this Notice and the subsequent RFP.  It is anticipated that a single fixed rate contract will be awarded from this solicitation.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE will be for 8 months from the date of contract award with 4 30-day option period, not to exceed 12 months (base and all option periods).  PRICE:  The Contractor shall furnish all work products and services; management, facilities; research participants; supervision and personnel (except as may be expressly set forth in this contract as furnished by the Government) necessary to perform and provide the requirements of the Statement of Work.  The proposed price shall be inclusive of all direct and indirect costs (salaries; fringe benefits; overhead and general and administrative expenses), survey expenses; honorarium, travel and profit and be applicable for the contract period of performance, (base period and any exercised option periods).  STATEMENT OF WORK BACKGROUND:  The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) believes taxpayer audits are a necessary tool for maintaining the integrity and fairness of the Federal income tax.  However, a recent Treasury Department study has expressed concern about a decline in audit rates and its potential impact on voluntary compliance.  TIGTA (2002) reports that the number of income tax return examinations fell 51 percent, from 1.6 million to 779,000 returns examined, between Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 to 2001, while the number of income tax returns filed grew 8 percent, from 128 million to 138 million returns.  Thus, overall income tax examination coverage fell 56 percent for this period, from 1.27 percent of all income tax returns filed to 0.56 percent, while the associated recommended assessments declined 29 percent, from $24.9 billion to $17.7 billion (TIGTA, 2002).  In addition to these direct impacts on Federal tax revenues, several studies have reported a deterrent effect of taxpayer audits.  In an econometric study for the years 1977-1986, Dubin, Graetz and Wilde (1990) found that for every dollar of revenue produced because of taxpayer audits, an additional six dollars of revenue were generated from the indirect or “ripple” effects.  However, the results of other studies have been mixed.  Tauchen, Witte and Beron (1989), using random taxpayer audit data from the 1969 Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP), find that raising the audit rate had an impact only on high-income wage and salary workers.   For this group of taxpayers, they estimate an indirect effect of audits to be almost three times the direct revenue effect.  Blumental, Christian and Slemrod (1998) describe a controlled field study carried out with the Minnesota Department of Revenue.  In their experiment, a stratified sample was selected based on three levels of 1993 income: low-income with adjusted gross income (AGI) less than $10,000, middle-income with AGI between $10,000 and $100,000, and high-income with AGI over $100,000.  The sample was split into a treatment group and a control group.  The Minnesota Department of Revenue informed the treatment group by mail that both their state and Federal income tax returns would be “closely examined.” In contrast to Tauchen, Witte and Beron (1989), the resulting differences in reported income and tax liability between the treatment group and the control group show that the heightened threat of examination increases reporting compliance among low and middle-income taxpayers, but among high-income taxpayers compliance actually decreased.  The authors interpret their findings as an indication of a more aggressive negotiating position on the part of high-income taxpayers in anticipation of an audit.  Finally, an internal IRS study (Plumley, 1996) found that taxpayer examinations have a strongly significant impact on reporting compliance.  Using an econometric approach and state-level data for the period 1982-1991, the study finds that for every $1.00 in tax adjustments on an examination opened in 1991, $11.60 of additional tax was voluntarily reported on individual income tax returns as a deterrent effect.  The report estimates that if “face-to-face” examination rates had been held constant at the 1982 level of 1.62 percent (instead of declining to 0.65 percent in 1991), an additional $257 billion of tax would have been voluntarily reported due to the indirect effect.  Clearly, this finding supports the theoretical conclusion that increasing audit rates would improve voluntary compliance.  How audits deter taxpayers from evading is not well understood.  According to Plumley (1996), “It is generally believed, for example, that many taxpayers would perceive increased auditing by IRS as an increase in their chances of being audited, and that they would improve their voluntary compliance as a result.” From this description, it is clear that audit-based deterrence depends on taxpayer awareness of the level and year-to-year change in examination rates as a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition.  Therefore, a valid test for the existence of indirect effects must ensure taxpayers are aware of the likelihood of audit.   This is unlikely to be the case using data from random taxpayer audits.  A greater degree of control is possible in field studies but such data also may contain a broad array of exogenous influences, such as changes in tax law or economic conditions that may cause taxpayers to change their behavior during the period of study.  The purpose of this study is to use an experimental approach to measure the indirect effects of taxpayer examinations using the standard expected utility model of tax evasion.  A high-level experimental design for estimating the indirect effects of audits is proposed.  The proposed experiment builds on previous work by improving parallelism with taxpayers’ decision framework.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill AFB, Florida, intends to repair and possibly overhaul P/N 54H60-77 Propeller Assembly, S/N N235504NR, P/N 710085-1 Valve Housing Assembly, S/N P5750, and P/N 597946 Control Assembly, S/N SE9264.  The propeller has been removed from WP-3D aircraft, tail number N43RF, located at the AOC, MacDill AFB, Florida. The propeller will be shipped as an assembly, on a propeller transportation stand provided by the Aircraft Operations Center.  Propeller has been removed for reverse and low pitch stop discrepancies.  Reverse could not be adjusted below -10 degrees blade angle even after two (2) valve-housing changes, and the low pitch stop lock release could not be adjusted below +30 degrees blade angle after two (2) low pitch stop replacements.  The propeller has 4709.2 hours since TSO and 7965.2 TT.  The Valve Housing Assembly has 2070.2 hours since TSO and 7316.2 TT.  The Control Assembly has 10070.2 TSO and 16682.2 TT.  The cost of shipping the propeller to and from the contractor facility shall be the responsibility of the Government. The Contractor's facility must be located within the USA.  The Contract is to be accomplished in four parts: (1) the contractor shall provide a quote for teardown and inspection of the above listed assemblies.  The contractor shall also provide a "worst case" quote to repair and or overhaul the above listed assemblies. (2) The contractor, will provide within seven (7) working days of receipt of the above assemblies, a report to the Contracting Officer (CO), of parts and labor required to return the assemblies to a serviceable, ready for installation condition and recommendations of the most cost effective and advantageous means to accomplish the work. (3) The teardown report and recommendations of the contractor will be reviewed by the CO and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).  Upon completion of the review the CO shall provide instructions to the contractor on how to proceed with the work. (4) Upon receipt of the instructions from the CO, the contractor shall have twenty-five (25) working days to accomplish the work.  The contractor shall provide all necessary special tools, labor, and parts (encompassing everything up to and including a major overhaul) to perform the requested work on the propeller assembly, valve housing assembly and control assembly.  If any additional discrepancies (including outstanding AD's or SB's), outside of normal repair/overhaul criteria, are discovered during performance of the work, the Contractor shall immediately stop work and notify the COTR of the additional discrepancies, to include any parts required, labor required and cost estimate for the additional work, including over-and-above costs to meet the turn around time line.  Contractor will not proceed with the additional work until approval for the additional work is received from the Contracting Officer.  Contractor shall accomplish all work following manufacturer's repair/overhaul manuals and applicable repair station procedures.  Contractor shall bench test the assemblies for proper performance parameters within manufacturer's limits.  Propeller will be returned to the Aircraft Operations Center on the same transportation stand provided at delivery. Return transportation of the propeller will be by ground transportation provided through the AOC. Technical Requirements: The Contractor must be a certified FAA Repair Station.  Authorized Hamilton Sunstrand Service Centers covering this propeller type are preferred, but not required. Contractor must have performed and provide written proof of an overhaul on this propeller type within the last 30 calendar days.  Upon return to service of the assemblies, the contractor shall provide all the proper documentation (i.e., FAA 8130 or equivalent and FAA 337 if required) and make the required entries into the propeller logbook provided with the propeller. Parts, Discounts, and Warranties:  The Contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous, at any time during the contract.  The Government will make the final determination on whether new, overhauled, or serviceable parts will be installed in the assemblies.  Parts or components in an "as removed" condition will not be installed in the assemblies.  Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over-and-above.  Since the government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, meet these criteria, contractors shall provide the labor rate they will charge the government, per hour for "over-and-above" discrepancies. Contractors shall provide what percent discount off list price for replacement parts will be given. As the AOC WP-3D aircraft average only 350 per year, the Contractor shall provide the AOC with a warranty providing a minimum of five hundred hours flight time or eighteen (18) months from time of installation of the propeller. Period of Performance: All work shall be accomplished within the time lines specified above.  Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Government Property: The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the performance of this work a minimum of $150,000 of insurance. Contractors responding to the solicitation shall submit the following information/documentation: Written documentation of having overhauled the same model propeller assembly, valve housing assembly and control assembly within the past 30 days. A copy of their FAA Repair Station Certificate, and proof of Hamilton Sunstrand authorized maintenance center (if applicable). Proof of insurance coverage. Discounted percentage off of list price of parts, normal hourly labor rates and over-and-above labor rates. Documentation of factory trained, A&P technicians on staff. Past performance on previous government contracts.  An offeror will be considered non-responsive if any documentation requested is not provided. Contract award will be based on the lowest price offer meeting the minimum specifications, using the commercial item acquisition process. The solicitation will be available on or about July 23, 2003.  Firms interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation should send a written request to the contracting officer, referencing this announcement number.  Requests may be made by fax (816) 426-7530) or e-mail.  This action is not set-aside for small business.

<DESC>***** This amendment serves to change the AUV delivery date to March 1, 2003.  The following statement of work replaces the original statement of work in its entirety.

The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, equipment, services, and facilities to provide an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that includes fisheries-specific instrumentation including: 1) a single-frequency 38 kHz split-beam scientific echo sounder and transducer with 12 degree beam width or narrower; 2) a 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler; 3) a conductivity-temperature-depth sensor; and 4) and a stereo digital color camera system (still or video).  The integrated AUV system must be turnkey and meet the following specifications:

1.	The AUV must be easily lifted by two people, deployable from a small-craft or from shore, and therefore must be small (less than 0.324 m in diameter and 2.5 m in length), and light (less than 100 kg in air).

2.	The AUV must be able to swim at speeds from 2 to over 10 knots and have a mission duration in excess of 20 hours swimming at 2.2 kts and 6 hours swimming at 5 kts while powered by lead-acid gel cell batteries.

3.	The AUV must be able to control speed to within 0.5% of the target speed, hold course to within 1 degree of the planned bearing, and hold depth to an accuracy of ± 2.5 cm.

4.	The AUV must be able to accurately execute missions in excess of 40 n.mi. completely autonomously.

5.	The AUV must be powered by lead-acid batteries or alternative rechargeable source. The battery packs must be easily changeable for rapid redeployment of the AUV and must also be rechargeable while installed in the AUV and when removed from the AUV.  A suitable battery charger is to be provided that can completely charge a battery pack in less than six hours.  At least two rechargeable battery packs must be provided with the AUV.   Additionally, alkaline battery packs or alternative energy packs must be a provided option to allow missions exceeding 96 hours at 2.2 kts.  

6.	The AUV must include fisheries instrumentation including a single-frequency 38 kHz split-beam scientific echo sounder (eg. Simrad EK60) and transducer with 12 degree or narrower beamwidth (eg. Simrad ES38-12), a 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (eg. RDI Workhorse), a conductivity-temperature-depth sensor (eg. Seabird SBE 37si MicroCat), and a stereo digital color still or video camera system (eg. twin Sony DSC U20).  The echo sounder transducer and the camera system must be "looking" in the same direction.  The standard "look" direction is down, but must be variable for side- and up-looking configurations. Alternative instrumentation with equivalent or superior specifications may be substituted with consent of the government.

7.	The AUV must be modular in design allowing simple assembly and disassembly and be comprised mainly of commercial off-the-shelf components.

8.	All of the source code for the AUV's instrumentation control and navigation software, and detailed schematics of all electronic circuits must be provided to enable field troubleshooting.  A troubleshooting guide is required.

9.	The modular hull sections must be lightweight and constructed of materials immune or highly resistant to corrosion.  All pressure containers must be sealed with o-rings.

10.	The vehicle must accommodate a modular payload of up to 1 m in length, 0.324 m in diameter, and 25 kg weight, and associated vehicle lengthening, without appreciable reductions in the operational speed and duration.  The aforementioned fisheries specific equipment can be included in this payload.

11.	The AUV must have a maximum operational depth of at least 150 m (preferably 300m or greater).

12.	The AUV must be fully operational in water temperatures ranging from -1.6°C to 35°C and remain unharmed for storage, and operational for testing in air temperatures ranging from -10°C to 45°C.  The AUV must be tolerant of icing and thermal shock encountered when deploying in Polar Regions.

13.	A 10/100 Ethernet connection to the central processing computer must be externally available through an underwater connector.

14.	A graphical user interface (GUI) must be provided for planning of safe mission waypoints and to monitor the mission progress.  The navigation planning and monitoring must be facilitated with electronic charting software that allows input and explicitly accounts for magnetic variation.

15.	The AUV must be capable of remotely accepting mission plans and updates from a computer located greater than 1 n.mi. away.  The AUV must be capable of telemetering positional information and scientific data to the remote computer.

16.	The AUV operations must be independent of acoustic positioning systems.

17.	When the AUV is transiting underwater between waypoints, navigation is to be performed using dead-reckoning algorithms or preferably via an inertial navigation system.  Dead reckoning is to be performed using algorithms that compensate for currents and account for intermittent GPS updates.

18.	While the AUV is at the surface, geographic position is to be measurable using WAAS-enabled or differential GPS.

19.	The AUV must be able to acquire GPS updates in sea states up to Beaufort 5.

20.	Acoustic Doppler estimates of velocities are to be used for estimating and compensating for vehicle set and drift by currents.  Heading information must be provided by a flux-gate or gyro compass; depth is to be monitored by a pressure sensor; height over the seafloor is to be monitored by an acoustic altimeter; and propeller rotation rate is to be monitored using a Hall effect tachometer.

21.	The AUV package must include rugged shipping containers for all components.

22.	The AUV package must include a corrosion-resistant equipment stand that supports the AUV during setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting activities, and for secure storage on the deck of a ship.

23.	The AUV package must include an expendable items spares kit for field repairs (connectors, o-rings, wiring harnesses, replacement fins or shrouds if easily damaged during deployment and recovery operations, etc.), and include a complete parts list of all commercial off-the shelf and custom AUV components.  A list of part numbers and pricing must be included for all custom AUV components.

24. AUV demonstrations by candidate Contractors must be organized and conducted by the candidate Contractors, in coordination with the government representatives, before 13 September 2003.  For these demonstrations, the AUVs, minus the fisheries-specific instrumentation package, must be demonstrated to conform to specifications. The results of the demonstrations will be used in the evaluation process.  Offerors will be rated on a pass/fail basis dependent upon either performance of the AUV or non performance of the AUV.  For these demonstrations, only the costs associated with the government representatives' meals, incidental expenses, lodging, and the transportation will be incurred by the government.  All other costs of the demonstrations are to be incurred by the candidate Contractors.

25. DELIVERY DATE:  The AUV must be delivered no later than March 1, 2004.  Post-award AUV on-site services shall include training on all AUV hardware and software systems, and successful sea trials to be conducted off the coast of San Diego, California.  The date for sea trials and acceptance tests will be negotiated at the time of award.  Acceptance tests will include two- and three-person deployments from both the shore and from a 19 foot skiff, respectively.  System integrations and testing shall include the complete AUV system, including all of the requisite fisheries instrumentation (echo sounder, ADCP, CTD, and stereo camera.


26. The operational performance and specification compliance of the candidate AUV must be fully demonstrated to NOAA Fisheries prior to acceptance of the AUV and associated payment in full.

27. Past Performance:  For evaluation purposes, Offerors must submit a list of 2-3 previous contracts performed of this nature within the past five years.  Offerors shall include the name of the company, contact name and phone number, original and final contract value, date of award and contract completion date.

Evaluation criteria is amended as follows:

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, Technical quality of the contractor's proposal is considered to be substantially more important than price.  The following factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Factors 1 and 2 are of equal value and more important than 3 and 4 which are also of equal value.

1.AUV size, weight, deployment duration, delivery schedule and preaward demonstrations. Offerors who offer an earlier delivery date will receive more credit for evaluation purposes. 2. Past performance. 3. Integration of fisheries instrumentation (echo sounder, ADCP, CTD, and stereo camera). 4. Navigational accuracy and precision, and ease of programming. 5.Use of commercial off-the-shelf components, and provision of all software source code and electronics schematics.  This is a best value requirement.  Award will be made to the Offeror who conforms to the solicitation requirements and whose proposal is judged by an integrated assessment of price and the other evaluation factors listed above.  The Government will use a best value trade off process to determine which offer is in the best interest of the Government.

<CONTACT>Arnold Payne, 913-684-1627
<DESC>NA The Northern Region Contracting Center, Mission Support Division, Fort Leavenworth, KS, is seeking sources among GSA schedule contractors.  The service requested is analytical support for the Army Transformation Concept Development and Experimentation Prog ram (AT-CDEP) and American, British, Canadian and Australian (ABCA) Armies Interoperability Exercise Program.  The vendor must have operational experience with Objective Force concepts within battle command scenarios.  Specifically, the vendors operational  experience should include:  1) at least two years of objective force battle command concept and implementation experience; 2) experience in planning and coordinating objective force battle command experiments and actual participation in at least one objec tive force battle command experiment that included human-in-the-loop role players, C2 devices, and an objective force federation of models; 3) experience in coalition planning to include on site participation with any of the ABCA nations, and 4) at least o ne year of experience with objective force scenario development.   This project is a continuation of the Analytic Support for the Command and Control, Communications, Computers Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Modeling and Analysis Wor king Group (MAWG) Program.  In the C4ISR experiment, the aim was to see how C4ISR impacted the unit of action (UA) commanders ability to command and control his unit.  The contractor was Booz-Allen and Hamilton.  The current requirement, Army Transformatio n Concept Development and Experimentation Program (AT-CDEP), addresses the human-in-the-loop (HITL) process.  The human inter-action required for interface with the  model and/or simulation.  This means a willful, decision-processed action must occur befor e the simulation can proceed.  Typically, the HITL process includes battle command decisions; applying the art of war more than the science.  Responsibilities include perform tasks associated with the development and management of the analysis portion of t he Army Transformation Concept Development and Experimentation Program (AT-CDEP).  Tasks include developing and coordinating the analysis plan to ensure synchronization with TRADOCs experiment plan and to ensure level of analytic rigor that is planned can support required transformation decisions.  The deliverable is an analysis annex to the AT-CDEP.   Perform tasks associated with the development, management and execution of the Integrated Study Plan (ISP) in support of Army experimentation.  Develop and c oordinate the ISP with TRADOC staff and subordinate battle labs to ensure a synchronous body of analysis is produced from several experiment venues.  Deliverable is the ISP and its continuous refinement.  Conduct scenario development in support of Army and  joint experimentation integrating events.  Develop scenarios that will support experimental events in FY04 and coordinate with multiple TRADOC battle labs to ensure consistency among different experiment venues.  Deliverable is a scenario that will suppor t FY04 experimental events.   Provide support to develop and manage a database management tool that harvests, stores, and disseminates critical analytic insights that underpin objective force requirements.  Provide developmental and analytic support to the  Australian British Canadian American (ABCA) cooperative interoperability experiments that will take place June 2004.  This task requires review and de-confliction of four separate nationsÃ¢Â€Â™ analysis and data collection plans in order to enable suffici ent resources for exercise execution.   Provide planning and execution support, to the Army Transformation Exercise 2004 (ATEX04) that will take place September 2004.  The complete requirements are included in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The Federal Supp ly Classification (FSC) code for this project is R421, NAICS code is 541519, and SIC code is 7379.  If no responsive/responsible replies are received, an order will be negotiated with Booz-Allen and Hamilton under GSA contract GS-35F-0306J for these services.  All responses will be considered and must include proof of the ability to provide analytical support for the Army Transformation Concept Development and Ex perimentation Program (AT-CDEP) and American, British, Canadian and Australian (ABCA) Armies Interoperability Exercise Program including performance information and references on the contractors abilities.

<DESC>This is a sources sought for the following synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with (IAW) the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: a written solicitation will not be issued.  PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE.  The solicitation will be issued on the world-wide web and can be found at the following website:  http://www.langley.af.mil/contracting/sol/99T0112/default.html.  (ii)  Solicitation F44600-99-T0112 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the test program for certain commercial items found at FAR 13.5.    (iii)  The solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 97-10 and Defense Acquisition Circular 91-13.  It is the contractors responsibility to be familiar with all applicable clauses and provisions.  (iv)  The 1st Contracting Squadron requests responses from qualified sources capable of providing SARA Software Licenses and Annual Maintenance Agreement, Manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company, P.O. Box 516, St. Louis, MO, 63166-0516.  Purchase is for thirty-five (35) each Squadron Assistance/Risk Assessment (SARA) Software Licenses and Annual Maintenance Agreement, with possible option to increase the quantity.  This is a commercial off-the-shelf item.  SARA has been developed by Boeing using internal company funds, affording Boeing sole proprietary rights to the software.  Accordingly, SARA software is not available from any other source.  SARA is a unit-level tool designed to assist military aviation organizations in the conduct of daily activities.  The software facilitates daily scheduling, accumulates unit data, and permits risk analysis of the data from a crew qualification perspective.  SARA will run either stand-alone or in a network configuration.  The tool is comprised of two separate applications designed to work in concert with one another.  (v)  The following requirements are applicable:  (1)  General: SARA Core Application:  Engineered in Microsoft Access 2.0. Comprised of a front-end (application) that links to a separate back-end (database) to provide flexibility in deployment and application evolution.  Over 300 table objects (relational model with referential integrity), 800 query objects (SQL definitions), 450 form objects (screens and dialogs), 100 report objects manipulated at runtime to create hundreds of report variations, and many thousands of lines of code interacting with the above objects.  Designed to run in the Microsoft Access 2.0 runtime environment, the SARA core application provides the interface to define and manage unit data.  The SARA core application provides capabilities in the following areas:  Basic Schedule Generation, Operational Risk Management, Crew Management, Operational (TR) Syllabus Management, Student Syllabus Management, Combat Readiness Management, Core Competency Readiness Management, Qualification Currency Management, Mission Currency Management, Mission/Event/Flying Time Management, Subjective Rating Management, Resource Planning (Tracking), Information Summaries (on screen, printed report), and Crew/Log Import/Export in Support of Detachment Operations.  The core application will run in a Microsoft Windows 3.1, 98, or NT environment.  The core scheduler permits the generation of unit schedules; however, advanced scheduling features are not available until the user activates the separate SARA Advanced Scheduler application engineered in Microsoft Visual C++5.0.  SARA is distributed with a runtime version of Microsoft Access 2.0, eliminating the need to install a full, retail version of Microsoft Access 2.0 to run the program.  A full retail version of Microsoft Access 97 is a highly desirable component for any SARA computer.  (2)  Materials:  All materials shall be new and conform to applicable standards specifications.  Hardware/Software:  Windows 95/NT 4.0+. Training and distribution of SARA will be performed at Contractors site by The Boeing Company.  (vi)  Delivery:  Date of delivery will be no later than February 10, 1999 however, an earlier delivery date is desired.  Place of Delivery and Acceptance for thirty-five (35) SARA Software Licenses will be made available at the Contractor site on scheduled training dates.  Responsibility and Inspection:  Unless otherwise specified in the contract or purchase order, the supplier is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements and Quality Control.  (vii)  The following FAR provisions and clauses are applicable to this procurement:  52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (AUG 1998) is hereby incorporated by reference.  (viii)  Solicitation provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items (JAN 1999) is hereby incorporated by reference.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER: 675-03-11 ISSUANCE DATE: 07-11-2003 CLOSING DATE: 08-08-2003 POSITION TITLE: Senior Democracy and Governance Advisor/ Team Leader  MARKET VALUE: GS-14 equivalent ($72,381-$94,098).  Final compensation will be based on the market value of the position, the individual's salary and work history, experience and educational background. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two years. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Conakry, Guinea POSITION DESCRIPTION:  1. Recommended Position Title:  Senior Democracy and Governance Advisor/Democracy and Governance Strategic Objective Team Leader 2. Organizational Location of Position:  USAID/Guinea Democratic Governance Strategic Objective Team 3. Position Title/Grade of Direct Supervisor:  Assistant Mission Director 4. Supervisory Controls: (How are assignments made and how much review/control will be provided by the supervisor.) The Senior Democracy and Governance (D/G) Team Leader will work under the general supervision and policy guidance of the Mission Director and the Assistant Mission Director.  The Assistant Mission Director will review and approve the incumbent’s work plan and performance measures. The Senior D/G Advisor/Team Leader is expected to work independently with limited guidance, to take initiative, to supervise professional staff and to lead the Democracy and Governance team activities. INTRODUCTION: USAID/Guinea’s Democracy and Governance Strategic Objective, “Improved Local and National Governance through Active Citizen Participation,” aims at fostering and reinforcing the democratic development of the Guinean population through a top down, bottom up approach. The Democracy and Governance Strategic Objective comprises three intermediate results which, in synergy with each other, will lead to its achievement: IR1: Effective Citizen Participation in Local Governance; IR2: More Responsive Political Processes; and, IR3: Increased articulation of Citizen Interests by Target Civil Society Organizations. BACKGROUND: As Guinea prepares for the presidential elections in 2003, the country faces an administration determined to retain power – putting in question the prospects for a free, fair and inclusive process.  However, USAID believes that progress can be made in improving the transparency of the electoral process through training of a broad spectrum of actors on roles and responsibilities in the democratic process.  USAID remains engaged for the approaching electoral process, as well as the long-term process of democratic development at multiple levels in the society. Guinea remains the linchpin for regional stability, even as instability and conflict along its borders continue. The fragility of the situation in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the ethnic rebellion in Cote d'Ivoire, combined with the internal tensions created by a series of flawed electoral processes in Guinea, have led people to conclude that there is little hope for regime change through legal means. These issues require USAID's continued engagement. POSITION DESCRIPTION: The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) Senior D/G Advisor will also be Team Leader of the Mission’s Democracy and Governance Strategic Objective Team and shall report to the Assistant Mission Director. The position will be based at the USAID Office in Conakry. The incumbent will also provide support for USAID D/G program activities in Sierra Leone, as required. USAID/Guinea is a Mission that is organized around teams and has delegated much of the decision-making to the strategic objective teams.  Currently, the Mission has four strategic objectives and one Special Objective: (1) Natural Resources Management, (2) Child Survival and Maternal Health, (3) Education and (4) Democracy and Governance; the Special Objective provides post-conflict transition assistance targeting Guinea’s Forest Region. Specific Tasks: The incumbent will be responsible for accomplishing the following tasks: Serve as Team leader for the D/G trategic Objective Team. S/he will be responsible for coordinating and supervising all activities undertaken by the SO and for achieving the results planned under the strategic objective; Analyze the evolving political environment in Guinea and assess potential opportunities for refining and possible expansion for the current D/G program, as necessary; Manage the implementation of the Mission’s bilateral D/G programs and develop a plan to coordinate D/G activities with other Mission activities, creating optimal synergies; Monitor and evaluate the impact and effectiveness of USAID D/G programs in Guinea, document the results achieved and provide reports on results to USAID/Washington; Integrate good governance and democratic principles, concepts and results into all USAID/Guinea SO programs and activities; Develop close working relationships with grantee principals and beneficiaries, periodically review grantees’ work  plans and monitor program implementation to ensure that results are being achieved; Advise the Mission in the formulation and management of D/G activities in Sierra Leone under USAID Guinea’s twinning responsibilities for program oversight in Sierra Leone; and, supervise FSN staff and ensure their full participation in the management of D/G activities, including monitoring and evaluation of performance and results reporting. MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: The incumbent serves as the senior advisor on democracy, governance and decentralization issues for USAID/Guinea.  He/She has high level responsibility for a broad range of key activities, including the conduct of in-depth analysis of the political and social situation in Guinea and recommending courses of action regarding all aspects of democratic governance to DG SO team, senior management and partners. S/he contributes to and reviews broad sectoral policy and activity planning discussions and documentation for coherence, relevance, and programmatic realism, and advises on how to define program content from the perspective of empowerment of citizens and in close collaboration with other SOT and implementing partners. S/he is the senior advisor on strategic planning activities for issues concerning elements of electoral assistance, civil society, transparent governance, and women’s participation as citizens in local democratic governance. As the Mission’s technical expert in democracy and governance, the majority of the incumbent’s time will be devoted to democracy and governance activities.  However, the DG expert will be expected to assist other teams in the Mission in fostering synergy.    Furthermore, s/he will be expected to work closely with senior USG officials at the Embassy to formulate position papers and analytical reports for senior management. Technical and Policy Advisory Support : Provide expert technical guidance and policy analysis for the Mission's D/G SO Team.

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION

Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security is seeking industry interest and information on commercial-off-the-shelf availability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to explore the feasibility and practicality by a vendor-sponsored demonstration.  CBP is intent on awarding a contract in the future to a contractor that can satisfy all or a large portion of the general requirements stated below.


2.0	MINIMUM OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Each demonstrated UAV system should have the following operating abilities and equipment:
	
SUPPORT, DEPLOYMENT AND OPERATION
1. Each UAV package will be fully supported, deployed, operated and maintained by vendor-supplied means under the direction of DHS/CBP field personnel.
2. Decisions regarding mission parameter and sensor manipulation will be the responsibility of the agency.  Proposed systems shall have the means to allow the control and manipulation of sensor(s) by agency personnel apart from the control and manipulation of flight by vendor(s).
3. Appropriate coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration for flight within the national airspace system will be the joint responsibility of the UAV flight controller and the agency prior to undertaking each flight.  
AUTONOMOUS FLIGHT
1. Ability to fly a preprogrammed flight plan including varying altitude and route patterns with return to launch site without controller input;
2. Ability to change the preprogrammed flight plan while in flight;
3. Ability to conduct autonomous flight to automatically return to launch site or other designated site for recovery in the event of loss of contact with controller;
4. Ability to track, follow or remain on station above a designated, mobile patrol unit for the maximum duration of flight;
5. Ability to override an automated flight program with manual flight control and then return to an automated flight program;
PERFORMANCE
1. Ability to fly during day and night conditions;
2. Ability to carry aloft a high performance sensor package (see sensor requirements)
3. Ability to fly at sufficient altitude from which data is transmitted so as to ensure no data loss during transmission to control center from maximum range;
4. Demonstrated range of not less than 75 nautical miles;
5. Demonstrated flight duration of not less than 4 hours;
6. Low noise signature relative to operating altitudes above ground so as not to be easily recognizable or audible by persons on the ground;
7. Ability to maintain complete functionality and flight during high density-altitude conditions of at least 10,000 feet above mean sea level (MSL);
8. Ability to maintain complete functionality and flight during wind conditions of up to 35 knots

SENSOR(S)
1. High definition color, NIIRS Level 5 quality, video image during day and lowlight conditions; 
2. High definition, near-NIIRS Level 5 quality, thermal imaging with minimum resolvable temperature so as to allow operator to distinguish between hidden human forms and warm desert backgrounds of sand, rocks and brush during summer months;
3. Ability to remotely and easily switch between color/low light camera and thermal imager in order to maintain continuous surveillance;
4. Ability to direct (point) optical sensors to survey specific GPS latitude and longitude while in flight;
5. Ability to direct (point) optical sensors to survey specific traffic thoroughfares and addresses using “point and click” digital mapping (i.e. GIS) and street address input while in flight;
6. Digital transmission of camera video from point of maximum mission range to controlling agency via line-of-sight telemetry link, an over-the-horizon satellite link, or other demonstrable means;
7. Electronic telemetry, video and control links to and from the aircraft must meet latest advanced encryption standards (AES);
8. Image magnification sufficiency so as to allow UAV to “stand off” at a distance so as not to be easily recognizable or audible by persons on the ground during the daytime, yet provides very detailed images.  
9. Ability to monitor sensor images from remote, mobile vehicles;
10. Image auto-tracking capability for all cameras;
11. Eye safe laser target identifier/designator/range finder.  Laser viewable from mil-spec night vision goggles to allow agency personnel on the ground or in other aircraft to easily identify the exact target being viewed by the UAV cameras

AVIONICS
1. Must be equipped with FAA-approved Mode C transponder;
2. Operator must have ability to precisely monitor the aerial vehicle’s location and immediately navigate it to specific GPS coordinates as directed or input by agency personnel;
3. Operator or agency personnel must have ability to precisely navigate the aerial vehicle to specific traffic thoroughfares and addresses using “point and click” digital mapping technology and street address input while in flight;

COLLISION-AVOIDANCE TECHNOLOGY
The full potential of UAV systems cannot be realized until they demonstrate the ability to operate safely and routinely within the existing U.S. air traffic management system.  See 3.0 Additional Desired Capabilities, Avionics;

1. FAA-approved anti-collision and position lighting, remotely activated and de-activated

COST ESTIMATES
1. Vendors must provide estimated hourly direct operating costs for each UAV system, including maintenance reserves and other customary aircraft operating cost data, for evaluation purposes of DHS/CBP;


3.0     ADDITIONAL DESIRED CAPABILITIES
While not required for demonstration purposes, the following capabilities may be sought for operational systems and information describing the vendor’s potential ability to meet these requirements should be presented in proposals and information made available during demonstrations:


PERFORMANCE
1. Ability to be launched in remote areas from mobile launch platforms or short, unimproved runways
2. Ability to land on short, unimproved runways or other recovery procedure/apparatus resulting in safe recovery in confined or remote areas after completion of controlled or autonomous flight.

SENSOR(S)
1. Advances in sensor magnification technology allowing extremely detailed identification of vehicles, aircraft and vessels, such as reading license plates and registration numbers, during the daytime while aerial vehicle “stands off” at a distance so as not to be easily recognizable or audible by persons on the ground;
2. Ability to simultaneously carry aloft and operate radar with the ability of detecting aircraft in flight and vehicles on the ground;
3. Ability to simultaneously carry aloft an agency mobile two-way communications repeater (transmission relay);

AVIONICS
1. Mode C transponder with remote reset and code reprogramming capability;
2. FAA-approved two-way communications ability so as to allow the controller to communicate with pilots of other aircraft or FAA air traffic control officials in the vicinity of an operating aerial vehicle in controlled airspace as if a pilot were actually aboard the aerial vehicle;
3. Ability to maintain a level of safety consistent with the see-and-avoid concept for all flights as would exist if a pilot were on board; i.e. Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) or other system from which data is viewable or available to the controller so as to receive audible and visual alerts to allow immediate maneuvers of the vehicle to avoid collision with other aircraft;
4. Detect, see and avoid system with the ability to alert the controller or pilot of any possible conflict with sufficient time to allow for evasive action.  System should automatically take control of the aircraft and deviate if there is not enough time for the controller to do so;


Subject to FAA guidance, item number two (2) may be waived if the vehicle is demonstrated as able to conduct flight above Class A controlled airspace limits, so long as the UAV controller has the means to meet the responsibility of communicating/coordinating with FAA air traffic control officials during the ascent and descent stages of flight.

EMERGENT SITUATIONS
1. Ability to disable, destroy or render useless the UAV and its technological equipment in the event of uncontrollable flight into hostile environments or circumstances rendering the vehicle as unrecoverable
2. Ability of the controller or pilot to take immediate control of the aircraft in emergency situations


4.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED FOR VENDOR CONSIDERATION:

PROPOSED DEMONSTRATION TIME PERIOD

The CBP anticipates that the demonstrations would take place during the period of September 14 though October 31, 2003.

FUTURE SUPPORT, DEPLOYMENT AND OPERATION
1. Each operational system offered may require multiple aerial vehicles or other capability so as to allow for mission continuity, i.e. reserve or backup aerial vehicles or components that will provide for uninterruptible mission support during periods of maintenance or unforeseen lack of availability of primary vehicles for whatever reason;
2. Each operational UAV system potentially acquired is projected to be fully supported, deployed, operated and maintained by vendor-supplied means under the direction of DHS/CBP field personnel. 
3. Once operational, appropriate coordination and flight clearance with the Federal Aviation Administration or other appropriate authority for the airspace used for flight within the national airspace system will be the responsibility of the UAV flight controller/vendor prior to undertaking each flight.  The agency will provide assistance and coordination where appropriate and necessary.  An operational flight protocol will be developed with the appropriate agencies governing the national airspace system.
4. Personnel provided by the vendor to operate UAV systems may be subjected to detailed background and suitability checks for appropriate security clearances.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: a written solicitation will not be issued.  PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE.  The solicitation will be issued on the world-wide web and can be found at the following website:  http://www.langley.af.mil/contracting/sol/99T0112/default.html.  (ii)  Solicitation F44600-99-T0112 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the test program for certain commercial items found at FAR 13.5.    (iii)  The solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 97-10 and Defense Acquisition Circular 91-13.  It is the contractors responsibility to be familiar with all applicable clauses and provisions.  (iv)  The 1st Contracting Squadron requests responses from qualified sources capable of providing SARA Software Licenses and Annual Maintenance Agreement, Manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company, P.O. Box 516, St. Louis, MO, 63166-0516.  Purchase is for thirty-five (35) each Squadron Assistance/Risk Assessment (SARA) Software Licenses and Annual Maintenance Agreement, with possible option to increase the quantity.  This is a commercial off-the-shelf item.  SARA has been developed by Boeing using internal company funds, affording Boeing sole proprietary rights to the software.  Accordingly, SARA software is not available from any other source.  SARA is a unit-level tool designed to assist military aviation organizations in the conduct of daily activities.  The software facilitates daily scheduling, accumulates unit data, and permits risk analysis of the data from a crew qualification perspective.  SARA will run either stand-alone or in a network configuration.  The tool is comprised of two separate applications designed to work in concert with one another.  (v)  The following requirements are applicable:  (1)  General: SARA Core Application:  Engineered in Microsoft Access 2.0. Comprised of a front-end (application) that links to a separate back-end (database) to provide flexibility in deployment and application evolution.  Over 300 table objects (relational model with referential integrity), 800 query objects (SQL definitions), 450 form objects (screens and dialogs), 100 report objects manipulated at runtime to create hundreds of report variations, and many thousands of lines of code interacting with the above objects.  Designed to run in the Microsoft Access 2.0 runtime environment, the SARA core application provides the interface to define and manage unit data.  The SARA core application provides capabilities in the following areas:  Basic Schedule Generation, Operational Risk Management, Crew Management, Operational (TR) Syllabus Management, Student Syllabus Management, Combat Readiness Management, Core Competency Readiness Management, Qualification Currency Management, Mission Currency Management, Mission/Event/Flying Time Management, Subjective Rating Management, Resource Planning (Tracking), Information Summaries (on screen, printed report), and Crew/Log Import/Export in Support of Detachment Operations.  The core application will run in a Microsoft Windows 3.1, 98, or NT environment.  The core scheduler permits the generation of unit schedules; however, advanced scheduling features are not available until the user activates the separate SARA Advanced Scheduler application engineered in Microsoft Visual C++5.0.  SARA is distributed with a runtime version of Microsoft Access 2.0, eliminating the need to install a full, retail version of Microsoft Access 2.0 to run the program.  A full retail version of Microsoft Access 97 is a highly desirable component for any SARA computer.  (2)  Materials:  All materials shall be new and conform to applicable standards specifications.  Hardware/Software:  Windows 95/NT 4.0+. Training and distribution of SARA will be performed at Contractors site by The Boeing Company.  (vi)  Delivery:  Date of delivery will be no later than February 08, 1999 however, an earlier delivery date is desired.

The IACs’ mission is to improve the productivity of researchers, engineers, and program managers in the Defense research, development, and acquisition communities by collecting, analyzing, synthesizing, and disseminating worldwide scientific and technical information in clearly defined, specialized fields or subject areas.  The IACs’ secondary mission is to promote standardization within their respective fields.  They accomplish these missions by providing in-depth analysis services and creating products.  IACs respond to technical inquiries; prepare state-of-the-art reports, handbooks, and databooks; perform technology assessments; and support exchanges of information among scientists, engineers, and practitioners of various disciplines within the scope or the IAC.  The RAC is the focal point to improve the Reliability, Maintainability, Quality, Supportability and Interoperability R/M/Q/S/I of systems and manufactured components.  The RAC provides valuable assistance to military and commercial researchers and engineers in the areas of R/Q/M/S/I of DoD systems, military systems, and the industrial and research base, which supports such systems.  The purpose of the RAC is: 1) to support the DoD research, development, test, acquisition and operational activities; 2) to assist DoD components/offices, other Government agencies, academia, Government contractors and U.S. industry as authorized, in the analysis and dissemination of the information within the R/M/S/Q/I areas; and 3) to promote the exchange of technical information within the R/M/S/Q/I subject areas throughout DoD's research, development and acquisition communities.   The RAC  continually monitors and extracts R/M/S/Q/I related STI from worldwide engineering, technical and scientific information sources, including documents, databases, and electronic, paper, and other information media.  In order to facilitate use of STI, the RAC performs studies and analyses; collects, synthesizes, and disseminates STI; develops and maintains inventories of relevant information in easily searchable and accessible information repositories; and provides scientific and technical advice to Government, industry, academia, and other approved domestic users.  The RAC ensures maximum use of the resources of other DoD IACs.  RAC information collection, analysis, and dissemination efforts should facilitate use of existing STI, while reducing unnecessary duplication of research, information collection and analysis, and information dissemination efforts.  The RAC should be operated in a manner that reduces incentives to establish redundant collection of R/M/S/Q/I related STI.  The RAC shall accomplish these objectives through methods that include, but are not limited to, the development and maintenance of anticipatory marketing of IAC products and services to STI users in Government, industry, and academia, as well as decision and policy makers in the RDT&E and acquisition communities.  The RAC shall seek out and identify opportunities to provide R/M/S/Q/I information to DoD components, other U.S. Government agencies and departments, their contractors, and other authorized users of RAC information and services.   RAC has been in existence for over thirty-five (35) years and is still necessary to support the DoD needs.  RAC is currently operating under contract SPO077-97-D-4006, which expires 28 Feb 2004.  In order to maintain RAC as a center of technical excellence for (RMSQI) technology, the continuity of operations is essential;  therefore, award of a one-year basic contract, with nine, one-year option periods, is anticipated.  A draft Statement of Work is hereby attached.

Interested vendors should provide a capability statement that describes the following:  1) The ability to provide the above service and experience in providing such service; 2) the size and scope of your previous efforts; and 3) any additional information that you believe would be helpful to DISA.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will sponsor an INDUSTRY DAY on July 22, 2003, 9:00 am to 4:00 pm, at the Bureau of Census, Federal Building #3, Morris H. Hansen Auditorium, Suitland Federal Center, Suitland, Maryland.  This will be an all day event that will be solely focused on the NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) requirement for the continued maintenance and support of the Central Environmental Satellite Computer System (CEMSCS) as previously posted at the following url:   http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOC/NOAA/AGAMD/NOAA-CEMSCS-04-04-2003/listing.html
Attendance will be limited to no more than five representatives per firm.  All attendees must register as an interested vendor at this posted location (Select Register as Interested Vendor).  Register no later than July 20, 2003.  This registration will be used for security clearance onto the site.  Those entering the Government facility may be subject to additional security measures.  Handout material will not be provided at the presentation, but will be posted to the FEDBIZOPPS website prior to July 22, 2003.  Attendees are responsible for downloading a copy of the presentation, if they require a copy during the days events. INDUSTRY DAY will consist of three major functions: (1)  the Government will provide the public with information on the CEMSCS; (2) the Government will facilitate a site visit of the system; and, (3) large businesses will be afforded space and a table to facilitate and promote small business participation in subcontracting.  Specific information pertaining to the three major functions is provided below:------------ (1) the Government will provide the public with information on the CEMSCS - During INDUSTRY DAY Government personnel will provide presentations on the NOAA NESDIS mission and goals as they relate to CEMSCS.  It is anticipated that these presentations will be three hours in duration.  The Department of Commerce and NOAA representatives from the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) will be providing information on the agencys Subcontracting guidelines.  Information may also be retrieved from the following url: http://www.osec.doc.gov/osdbu/Subcontracting.htm.  All information provided during INDUSTRY DAY is for informational purposes and should not be considered a requirement unless specifically stated in the resulting solicitation. ------------ (2) the Government will facilitate a site visit of the system - A tour of the computer area will be conducted.  Space for the tour is limited.  The Government will have a registration table during the morning of July 22 for tour/site visit registration.  Firms must register for the tour at the registration table in person. Registration will be on a first come, first served basis and NO MORE THAN TWO REPRESENTATIVES PER FIRM will be registered for the tour. ------------ (3) large businesses will be afforded space and a table to facilitate and promote small business participation in subcontracting.  The Government has established small business subcontracting goals for the NESDIS CEMSCS acquisition. Offerors will be required to submit information with their proposal that addresses their proposed small business subcontracting plan including the proposed goals and approach to meeting the goals. The acquisition will require offerors to subcontract not less than 20 percent of the amount proposed for the acquisition to small businesses utilizing direct services.  In addition, offerors will be required to maintain small business subcontracting at percentages consistent with the Department of Commerce small business subcontracting goals guidelines of  44 percent of the total subcontracted amount to small businesses, that includes subcontracting as follows: 18 percent to small disadvantaged businesses, 8 percent to women-owned small businesses, 4 percent to veteran-owned small businesses, 3 percent to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and 3 percent to HUBzones.  The Government will be aggressively monitoring small business subcontracting throughout the life of this acquisition and incentives in the contract will be based, in part, on the contractors actual performance in meeting and exceeding the established goals.  In order to promote and facilitate small business subcontracting effort, the Government is making tables available to interested vendors seeking small businesses for subcontracting opportunities for the CEMSCS acquisition. This will benefit those large businesses that participate by demonstrating positive efforts in trying to ascertain small business subcontracting for this requirement.

<OFFADD>Department of the Navy, Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, Commander, Navy Region, Mid-Atlantic, 6506 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, VA, 23508-2836
<SUBJECT>R -- Financial Services
<DESC>Commander, Navy Region, Mid—Atlantic is seeking the establishment of banking or credit union services at Naval Support Activity, Norfolk, Northwest Annex.  In addition to customary consumer financial services, the bank or credit union is to provide Automated Teller Machine (ATM) service.  The bank or credit union will be located inside a secure perimeter and thus will not be accessible to the general public.  The base is located in a rural area several miles from the nearest commercial financial institution.  The installation is currently home to approximately 1600 military, civilian and contractor personnel.  About 20% are enlisted Marines or Navy sailors temporarily assigned to the base for training.  Per capita ATM transactions, therefore, are relatively high.  

    The Department of the Navy (DON) will grant final approval based upon the Commander, Navy Region, Mid-Atlantic’s evaluation of the proposals received.  If selected, your bank/credit union will be entering into a lease and operating agreement with the Government.  A sample operating agreement can be found at the web site identified below.  Additionally, your bank/credit union will have to follow the policies outlined in the Department of Defense (DoD) Directive and the DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR), which should be reviewed prior to your solicitation for proposals.  The DoD Directive and DoD FMR may be obtained from the Office of Financial Operations web site at http://www.fmo.navy.mil/services/financialinstitutions.htm.

    The DON’s decision will be based on which financial institution offers the best overall value to the Government as demonstrated by the financial services and products to be provided to military and civilian personnel at the installation.  In evaluating the proposals, the DON will consider the following elements, which are approximately equal in importance:

	a.	Services offered
		•	range
		•	convenience
		•	cost

b.	Long term services available to a mobile population

c.	Past performance

	   Using the enclosed questionnaire, specific items to be addressed in your proposal include: schedule for opening the branch office; staffing levels for the branch office; hours of operation for the branch office; schedule for ATM implementation; frequency of servicing ATM; and existing locations where financial services are currently provided to DoD military and civilian personnel.  Additionally, the proposal must address loan services, savings services, business account and/or services, and other products and services offered.  Any other information that you desire to be considered, such as information about past performance, may also be addressed in your proposal.  

    Your proposal, including responses to the attached questionnaire, should be forwarded by August 1, 2003 to Commander, Navy Region, Mid-Atlantic, Code N02B2, 6506 Hampton Blvd., Norfolk, VA  23508.

<SUBJECT>59 -- FPI Production in FSC Code 5965
<DESC>This notice announces a decision by the Board of Directors for Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) regarding FPI's production in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 5965 - Headsets, Handsets, Microphones and Speakers.

FPI's new product/significant expansion guidelines were published March 12, 1997 in the Federal Register.  A provision of the guidelines allows for FPI to exceed a specific product's expansion threshold in cases of public exigency, such as a national defense emergency.  The guidelines require that FPI receive a specific order or request from the Department of Defense (DoD) or Executive Branch officials for this provision to be invoked.  Upon invoking this provision, the guidelines allow that “increased sales resulting from national exigencies will not be considered a violation of the guidelines ceiling in the year in which they occur.”

On May 20, 2003, FPI received an official request from the Department of the Army's Program Executive Office - Command, Control, and Communications Tactical at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey.  The correspondence requested FPI to fulfill DoD's need for loudspeaker control monitors in FSC code 5965.  FPI's FY 2003 sales ceiling for FSC code 5965 is $8.7 million.  Based on year-to-date sales, the additional work represented by the DoD request would cause FPI to exceed the sales ceilings for FSC code 5965.

The DoD request stated that FPI is the only source for this item, which has experienced sharply increased demand as a result of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The DoD request said “Specifically, many previously unequipped National Guard units have been called to duty to support these two operations.  Many of these units were not forecasted to receive this equipment this year....UNICOR was called upon to expeditiously fill this important and unforseen demand.”

FPI presented its Board of Directors with a request to invoke the guidelines' “national exigency” provision.  In light of the military's critical need for this item, FPI staff requested its Board to invoke the “national exigency” provision for FSC code 5965.  On June 26, 2003, FPI's Board of Directors officially approved this request.  Accordingly, FPI's sales in FSC code 5965 may temporarily exceed the guidelines ceiling without constituting a guidelines violation.

It should be noted that the national exigency provision of FPI's guidelines is temporary.  It does not authorize FPI to utilize the higher sales level as a future production baseline.  FPI is not certain how long the current exigency will last due to the ongoing military operations.  While the requested production levels are deemed to be on a temporary basis, at this time, DoD does not know how long the requirement for additional production in this FSC code will last.  At a minimum, however, it is expected that increased production levels as a result of DoD's expanded needs will continue through the balance of the current fiscal year and into FY 2004.

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI's Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, DC  20534. Attention:  FPI Board of Directors.

If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the offeror should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the following address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)/2100 Second Street, SW/Washington, DC/20593-000l/Ph: (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential offerors should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and the solicitation closing date. All responses submitting the required information will be fully considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. For questions, contact Linda Bonham at 202-267-2480 or e-mail: lbonham@comdt.uscg.mil.  See Numbered Notes 1 and 22 (modified by requiring responses with 10 days).

PROJECT BACKGROUND:  Technological changes are affecting the way organizations combat rumors and disseminate information.  As the primary organization for developing Air Force Public Affairs Doctrine, PACE requires in-depth research on unique aspects of web-based crisis communications.  This subject matter expertise is needed on a temporary basis in support of an in-house curriculum development by PACE. PROJECT OBJECTIVE:  Obtain in-depth academic research and analysis of origins, deleterious effects and measurements of potential harm to organizations due to web-based rumors.  The objective is to include effective web-based response strategies for combating rumors and inaccurate allegations against an organization into the curriculum of various Air Force Public Affairs courses. SCOPE OF WORK:  Approximately 100 hours of research culminating in case studies and recommendations directly addressing the unique aspects of web-based crisis communications.

DELIVERABLES:  Technical reports and non-technical reports concerning the subject area.  Subject matter expertise support to the Air Force curriculum development effort. MILESTONES:  Bi-weekly discussions with Director, PACE to keep research efforts in line with Air Force doctrine requirements.  RESEARCH QUESTIONS:  1.  How are opinions and awareness formed and influenced via the web?  2.  Does using web prolong crisis and when should the organization disengage from web communication on a particular issue? 3.  How do we establish and maintain credibility:  what types of web information do people find credible and reliable?  4.  What are the downside risks of web-based communications?  5.  What are the pros and cons of posting transcripts of interviews of your organization’s spokespeople conducted by the media?  6.  What are the manpower requirements to make a good web site?  7.  Is having live chats with subject experts/others a good idea?  If so, should they be periodic or scheduled?  Would that change depending on whether it was a crisis situation?  8.  When would using web media vs. conventional media be more effective?  9.  What are some examples of best practices from companies which use the web for crisis communication?  10.  What is the best design/layout (including linkages)?  11.  What draws people to our website in times other than crises?  12.  How do we draw people to the site and notify the public of updates?  13.  How do we judge how user-friendly or useful our site is to the public we want to reach? 14.  How does a site become attractive to Bloggers/major sites so that they link to it? 15.   What are the pros and cons of having a place to post public comment, and what is the best process for setting up such a place? 16.  Do people really use blogs as a source of information about a situation? 17. How do we stay on top of emerging trends such as wireless/Palms etc?  Additional questions may be added as the project develops. Offers should include an hourly rate and resumes of the Subject Matter Expert who will be assigned to this requirement.  Also include examples of related work and references. Evaluation criteria are as follows technical capability, price, and past performance.
