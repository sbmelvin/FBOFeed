The Printing Plate Process Section possesses a Polychrome Plate Processor specifically manufactured to develop Kodak Polychrome plates using chemicals, which are uniquely formulated to remove excess coating from exposed plates, which reduces delays resulting from incompatibility between chemical and plates.  Experimental tests run over a period of years in our printing plant have proven that Polychrome plates produce consistently high results, which other plates do not.  It is believed that Polychrome plates are only available from Kodak Polychrome Graphics.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSED ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice must be submitted via e-mail to: mfritts@usgs.gov by 12/08/02.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP)] for support to the Fluid Physics and Dynamics Group (TD63) to Optical Sciences Corporation (OSC) of Huntsville, Alabama.  OSC is currently a subcontractor under a Space Transportation Directorate (TD) contract that has the primary task of performing detailed rocket engine vibration data analysis obtained from test and flight operations with the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) and other advanced rocket engine system programs, vibration data analysis tool development, and advanced high-speed data acquisition and processing systems development and integration.  These efforts encompass the analytical/statistical assessment of rocket engine component vibration data and the continued development of hardware systems necessary to provide crucial and timely results for the diagnostic health assessment of advanced rocket engine programs.  This effort has a 5 year hisoty of ongoing software and hardware development. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Optical Sciences Corporation. The Authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 22304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because OSC has provided detailed software analysis code and hardware system design, development, and integration support for TD in-house developed high-frequency data acquisition and processing systems such as the Real-Time Vibration Monitoring System (RTVMS) and the Multi-channel Integrated Dynamic Data Acquisition System (MIDDAS) in support of the SSME Project.  These enhanced software analysis algorithms are specifically tailored for these in-house systems and must be continually maintained and enhanced to keep pace with changing engine project needs and requirements.  OSC has provided vital support for the design and development of crucial, cutting-edge acquisition and processing systems that are currently part of the SSME test support analysis program and are being implemented in a major two-phase Space Shuttle Safety Upgrade program known as the SSME Advanced Health Management System (AHMS).	OSC has been the primary source of software algorithm and hardware system development for the RTVMS, which is used as a real-time vibration redline cutoff system for every SSME static test and is the basis for the RTVMS and Advanced RTVMS (ARTVMS) algorithm implementation on both Phase I and Phase II of the AHMS program.  OSC's knowledge and experience with the RTVMS will enable NASA/MSFC to implement and maintain the first and only real-time vibration redline/health management system technology available for use in the SSME flight program by capitalizing on previous investments for this effort.  Furthermore, OSC's unique operational knowledge of these TD specialized systems and software algorithms are necessary for NASA/MSFC to maintain state-of-the-art data acquisition and processing systems to meet schedule for operational SSME tests and flights, as well as next generation propulsion systems that are being developed for the Space Launch Initiative (SLI) Program and other advanced propulsion technology programs.  OSC is the only known source capable of sustaining the current level of operational proficiency and accuracy required with these specific TD systems/algorithms while providing the capability to continually advance these state-of-the-art operations for enhanced rocket engine system vibration diagnostic health assessment.	The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:    http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

The Get Out the Vote Campaign is a Federal Voting A ssistance Program activity that has been performed since the early 1970s. The purpose of this campaign is to promote citizen participation in the political process by encouraging them to register and vote. The initial focus of this effort was on the Unifo rmed Services and it was carried out in close coordination with the Military Departments. The scope of the campaign has expanded over the past 25 years to reflect the broadening of absentee voter legislation. While the close working relationship with the M ilitary Services has been maintained, the program has also reached out to engage State and local government election officials and organizations in keeping with the Congressional mandate of Federal, State and local cooperation.  The Federal Voting Assistan ce Program (FVAP) is an integral part of the nations electoral process. FVAP administers the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 (UOCAVA), which guarantees the right to vote of Uniformed Services personnel and their dependents when  absent from their voting residence, and all U.S. citizens when residing outside the United States. The FVAP also carries out the Department of Defense responsibilities under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), the purpose of which is to promote vo ter registration and participation in the electoral process.  The objective of this contract is to provide the services and products required by FVAP to field a successful and effective continuous Get Out the Vote Campaign and will include the following: 1 ) Development of a campaign strategy and focus, 2) Creation of multimedia public service announcement (PSA) products to carry out the strategy, 3) Dissemination of these multimedia PSA products to national media outlets, and, 4) Monitoring and reporting th e results of media placement efforts.   The period of performance will be for one (1) base year and four (4) option years.  No RFP is available for competitive bidding.  This announcement is for informational purposes only.

<SUBJECT>A--Advanced and Key Oilfield Technologies for Independents
<SOLNBR>DE-PS26--03NT15391-0
<RESPDATE>022403
<ARCHDATE>03262003
<CONTACT>Richard Rogus, Contracting Officer, Please contact the Contract Specialist, K. Miles identified below., rogus@netl.doe.gov;Keith Miles, Contract Specialist, 412-386-5984, miles@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), on behalf of its National Petroleum Technology Office (NPTO), will seek applications for cost-shared development and demonstration projects using advanced and key oilfield technologies in the United States.  The proposed project should address a technical risk that results in the technology?s full acceptance by the independents.   The goal is to provide technical solutions to issues that are limiting domestic on-shore or off-shore oil exploration and production by independent oil producing companies while providing the same or higher levels of environmental protection expected under the law. Applications will either address: 1) Existing Fields or 2) Exploration. The goals  of the Department of Energy?s Fossil Energy Oil Program are derived from the National need for increased oil production as a part of the national security, requirements for Federal Lands stewardship,  and increased protection of the environment.  The Oil Reservoir Life Extension Program supports those goals.  In addition, the program supports  the National Energy Policy goals to increase domestic oil exploration through continued partnership with public and private entities and to promote enhanced oil recovery from existing wells through new technology.  By providing demonstrations of new technologies and approaches that improve oil recovery and increase reserves the oil program will increase the domestic oil supply. The Department of Energy Oil Program has, through funding by Congress focused on the needs of the Nation?s independent oil producers.  The Administration also addressed the needs of the independent oil producer in the National Energy Policy when they recognized that, "Small independent businesses account for 50-65% of domestic petroleum and natural gas production in the lower 48 states.?  Independent producers have  rapidly moved operations into regions that were traditionally explored and operated by the major oil companies.  Recently the many of the Nation?s independent producers placed in  the ranks of the top 20 producing companies in the United States. They currently maintain 63% of the oil reserves and 62% of the oil production. They control 50% of the gas reserves and 52% of the gas production.  This program builds on the successful reservoir field demonstrations in the Research with Independents program by expanding the research and demonstration opportunities for independent producers to more complex, higher risk projects. Projects selected would be mid-term projects that could impact Independent production capabilities and thus have a potential for significant impact on domestic production and proved reserves, thereby increasing energy security and supply.  Mid-term projects should have results in 5 -10 years.  The projects should encourage other independents to adopt the use of advanced and key technologies that prove successful in the future exploration and development of domestic reserves. Projects do not need to be limited to one area of operations.  They may address multiple technologies such as exploration, drilling and completion, well stimulation, enhanced oil recovery or other operational issues.  The proposed project must however address the identified problems in such a way that evaluation of the success or failure can occur and the reasons can be attributed clearly to the technology. The two areas of interest for this solicitation are: Area of Interest 1 - Existing Fields The projects in this area will promote the goals of the National Energy Policy to use new technology to promote enhanced oil and gas recovery in established areas of production.  It addresses the technical risk associated with developing, testing and deploying an advanced or key technology under actual field conditions.  This program provides the connection between the laboratory and the oilfield and applications are expected to provide documentation of the need for this technology and the problem that it will address.  The program allows continued development of a technology to create evolutionary improvements in performance and then the demonstration of such improvements in actual field conditions. Area of Interest 2 - Exploration The projects in this area target the National Energy Policy goal of advancing exploration methodologies and technologies through the partnership with the independent producers conducting exploration.  The DOE will partner with independent producers and others in an effort to push the limits of standard exploration technologies and to improve them. Applications are expected to describe the overall exploration problem and propose the technical solution to the identified problem.  They should address the need of the independent producer with regard to a region and show that the project provides such a solution to the problem or problems. DOE anticipates awarding approximately four (4) or five (5) financial assistance (i.e., Cooperative Agreements) with a project performance period no less than three years in length and no more than  five years in length. Approximately $7.0 million of DOE funding is planned over a 3-year period for this solicitation.  The proposed projects will contain a field demonstration and as such under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 a minimum of 50% cost share of the total estimated project cost is required.  The maximum DOE share of  an award will be $2000K. This competitive solicitation is open to any business, educational institution or state agency and is for the benefit of domestic independent producers. Moreover, for the purposes of this solicitation, an Independent operator shall be a non-integrated company which receives most of its revenue from crude oil or natural gas production at the wellhead.  Independents are exclusively in the exploration and production segment of the industry with no retail outlets, marketing or refining operations.  Applications submitted by or on behalf of 1) another Federal agency; 2) a Federally Funded Research and Development Center sponsored by another Federal agency; or 3) a Department of Energy (DOE) Management Operating (M&O) contractor will not be eligible for award under this solicitation.  However, an application that includes performance of a portion of the work by a DOE M&O contractor will be evaluated and may be considered for award subject to the provisions to be set forth in Program Solicitation DE-PS26-03NT15391.  (NOTE: The limit on participation by an M&O contractor for an individual project under this solicitation cannot exceed 25% of the total project cost). Once released, the master solicitation will be available for downloading from the IIPS Internet page.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. Item 1:  Qty: Up to 6  Forming Mandrels (1 Basic Order, 5 Optional Units) GSFC intends to procure as many as six (6) forming mandrels, as identified in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  GSFC intends to award one or two purchase orders to satisfy these requirements. The basic order requirement will be for the first unit (F1600P).  However, if a second purchase order is awarded, the second source will provide the second unit (F1600S) as the basic order requirement.  The purchase order(s) will contain options for the remaining five units not provided under the basic order requirements, and the Government may elect to exercise any or all of these options. The details required of any response to this RFQ are: 1. Binding price quotation and delivery schedule for the six forming mandrels specified in Table 1 (see attached SOW).  Offerors should assume unit F1600P will be the first required unit, but should understand that, in the case where NASA/GSFC awards two purchase orders, one of the successful offerors will be required to deliver F1600S as the first required unit.  In that case, unit F1600P will be the first optional unit under that second purchase order.  The prices should be clearly broken down into three categories:  (a) non-recurring tooling/setup charges (b) recurring blank material charges (c) recurring processing charges (d) metrology cost 2. Binding price quotations and delivery schedules for the option to purchase the other mandrels specified in Table 1 (see attached SOW), and required timetable for GSFC to exercise the option.  The options will be structured as follows: Option 1: F1600P and F1600S (priced separately) Option 2: F1200P and F1200S (priced together) Option 3: F1000P and F1000S (priced together) 3. Specific information regarding method of shipping and proposed shipping container. 4. Metrology data (to be delivered with the mandrels) shall include mid-point diameter, cone angle axial figure, roundness, and surface finish roughness. PLEASE SEE ATTACHED FILE FOR ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS AND DIAGRAMS. This procurement shall be conducted utilizing Best Value Selection (BVS), which seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the offerors and the Government. BVS takes advantage of the lower complexity of Simplified Acquisition Procedures and predefines the value characteristics which will serve as the discriminators among offers.  BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the offeror with the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will consider awarding to an offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value. Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.  The specifications included in the solicitation serve as the Government's baseline requirements. The following value characteristics establish what the Government considers to be valuable in an offer. These value characteristics are performance based and permit selection of the offer which provides better results for a reasonable marginal increase in price. All offers will be judged against these value characteristics. Price and technical (including past performance) factors will be considered equal in importance and will not be assigned weights. On those value characteristics the offeror chooses to provide, adequate information should be submitted to permit proper evaluation.

<DESC>CW or pulsed (If pulsed, pulse width must be greater than 10 microseconds, with amplitude flat to +/- 3% over 90% of the width of the pulse)
Wavelength: between 400 nm and 700 nm (shorter is better)
Optical output power: 10 milliWatts or greater.  There is a good chance that we will want about 100 milliWatts
Relative Intensity Noise, RIN  <-90 dB/Hz
Intensity Noise, 10 Hz to 2 MHz:  <0.1% RMS
Single frequency 
Linewidth: less than 20 kHz per 100 milliseconds
Frequency drift: 2 MegaHertz/minute maximum
Frequency tunable over a minimum 20 GHz range via thermal or piezo control.  
External input for frequency control to allow two lasers to be frequency locked and produce an optical heterodyne signal at frequencies ranging from 100 MHz to 20 GHz
Benchtop package, not requiring water cooling


2.  	Optical heterodyne system to generate an optical sine wave at frequencies variable from 1 MHz to 20 Ghz.  The system would consist of two frequency tunable lasers along with the optics to combine the beams, a closed loop feedback circuit to monitor the optical output, and the electronic circuit to stabilize the output frequency at the desired frequency as referenced to a stable oscillator.

CW or pulsed (If pulsed, pulse width must be greater than 10 microseconds, with amplitude flat to +/- 3% over 90% of the width of the pulse)
Wavelength: between 400 nm and 700 nm (shorter is better)
Optical output power: 10 milliWatts or greater.    There is a good chance that we will want about 100 milliWatts.
Heterodyne frequency:  variable 100 MHz to 20 Ghz, accurate and stable to or 0.01% over a 1 hour period
Benchtop package, not requiring water cooling
Modulation depth:  98% or better


3.  We would also be interested in a similar device operating at 266 nm or shorter wavelength.  Some of the requirements could probably be relaxed if compromise is necessary to reach this wavelength.

<DESC>The beams that propagate from the laser systems at our calibrations facilities have a poor intensity profile.  A laser beam homogenizer is needed for application in both the short pulse, and long pulse laser labs.  At a very simplistic level, we want to put this optic into the beam path, and have the output from the optic have a uniform intensity.  The optic will not be sensitive to incidence angle.  The following table will give more information on the specifications we want for the optic.

Table 1:  Specifications for Homogenizers
Wavelength	Intensity variation	Efficiency	Damage Threshold
532 nm	1 %	70 %	100 mJ
355 nm	1 %	70 %	50 mJ
213 nm	1 %	70 %	10 mJ
800 nm	1 %	75 %	10 mJ
400 nm	1 %	75 %	2 mJ
200 nm	1 %	75 %	0.2 mJ

	The homogenizer should work in a minimal area, as space is limited to 3-5 feet for the optic.  It should also have a clear aperture of 10mm diameter or better.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Amendment 1 to BAA 02-06-IFKA "Audio Processing".  Technical POC: Mr. Steve Smith, Program Manager, (315) 330-7894, email: ssmith@rl.af.mil (for this amendment only) Contracting POC: Contracting POC: Joetta A. Bernhard, Contracting Officer, (315)330-2308, email: Joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil.  This amendment is looking for a more specific area than the broadly defined announcement of BAA 02-06, as follows:  The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is specifically soliciting white papers under this amended announcement for studies and experiments in spoken language translation technologies for support of military operations.  Emphasis for this research is language translation techniques and methods in the Interlingua, NOT point solutions. The Interlingua technique will translate two languages in one domain, and demonstrate simplistic adaptation to a new domain and a new language. Equally important is the development of a speaker independent, Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR), which can easily be reprogrammed to a new domain and a new language.  The ASR should maintain recognition accuracy of demodulated speech with channel effects that average 10 dB signal-to-noise ratios. 
Deliverables will be technical reports, source code, and demonstrations and associated data.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a five (5) to seven (9) page white paper on their proposed research approach with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, small women-owned small or small disadvantaged business, or Historically Black College, University, or Minority Institutions. All responses to this BAA must be addressed to:  AFRL/IFEC, Attn:   Steve Smith, 32 Brooks Rd., Rome, NY    13441-4114.   The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company, Section B: Task Objective, and Section C: Technical Summary.  White papers must reference BAA 02-06-IFKA, Amendment 1, and shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this amendment.  Evaluation of proposals for this amendment only will be performed using the following criteria in descending order of importance:  (1) The Overall Scientific and/or Technical Merits of the Proposal, (2) Innovative Approach and/or Techniques, (3) Contributions to the Tactical Speech Processing mission, (4) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any.   The technical and cost information will be evaluated simultaneously.   The technical criteria, 1-3 above, will also be used to determine whether the white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this amendment and of interest to the Government.  In addition, the Government may consider other factors such as:  (1) The offeror?s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (2) The qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel; and (3) The offeror's record of past and present performance.    No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals.  Principle funding for proposals selected from this announcement will begin in FY03 with awards not exceeding twenty-four (24) months in duration.   Awards of efforts as a result of this amendment will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.   Total funding for this amendment is $1M.  Last date for submission of white papers is 30 Jan. 03, for this amendment only.  All other elements of the initial announcement of BAA 02-06 have not changed and apply to this amendment.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), General and Industrial Directorate, is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor for the roll out of the Facilities Maintenance Services Initiative. The goal is to have a multi-service multiple award contract vehicle that would allow base facility managers to order services on an as-needed basis.
The initiative will encompass all services associated with facilities maintenance.   The areas that will be targeted include: building repairs, roofing, paving, painting, plumbing, pipefitting, heating, fire alarms, air conditioning, locksmith services, elevator maintenance, electrical, glasswork, demolition and facility operations. This is a representative list and should not be considered exhaustive of all services that will be in the initiative.  The initial implementation was awarded in September of 2001 for the Northeast Region of the United States. This roll out region defined as the Southeast Region of the Continental United States (CONUS) target audience will include military bases and all other DoD and Federal agencies in the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. In addition, military bases and other Federal activities located in Puerto Rico and the American Virgin Islands are included in the Southeast Region. 

Prospective contractors should be able to adequately support services that will range from a minimum of $10,000.00 to a maximum potential of $100 million annually.  The maximum dollar value is contingent on the number of facilities and the extent of the participation of those facilities at any given time. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 235990, facilities maintenance services.  

Subject solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contracts being firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, and indefinite quantity.   One of the resultant contracts will be reserved for a small business provided that at least two responsible small business concerns will submit competitive proposals under this solicitation.  The performance period will be for five years, including a two?year base period with three (3) one-year term options. This will be a best value source selection acquisition in which technical merit is considered more important than price. Oral presentations will be a part of the technical evaluation. All information submitted is at the offeror?s expense. The Government is not responsible for any aspect of transportation to or from the location for the oral presentation.  Solicitation number SP0500-02-R-0038 will be issued on 02 DEC 2002 with a closing date of 16 JAN 2003.   After the initial contracts are awarded, all services will be procured through the issuance of individual task orders, each one defined by a separate statement of work. All industry firms capable of accomplishing the required services are requested to obtain a copy of this solicitation that can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.mil/home.

<ARCHDATE>12022003
<CONTACT>Joe Pratt Contract Specialist 2083785139     jpratt@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals or a general request for SF 254s.  NAICS code for this requirement is 541330.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Contracts Group, intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for Architect and Engineering Services in support of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Habitat Program in the Upper and Middle Fork John Day River sub-basins in Oregon.  The December 2000 National Marine Fisheries Service's Biological Opinion for the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) requires Reclamation to complete off-site habitat work to mitigate for the effects of the FCRPS operation and configuration (action item #149).  The goal of the off-site work is to improve migration, spawning, and rearing habitat in priority sub-basins.  Among other things, the Biological Opinion requires Reclamation to address flow, passage, and screening problems in the Upper Mainstem and Middle Fork sub-basins of the John Day River.  Much of the work currently accomplished by the Grant County Soil and Water Conservation District (District) contributes significantly to achieving habitat improvements in these areas.  As a local subdivision of Oregon State Government with a licensed professional engineer on staff, the District is a public body permitted to complete engineering work in the State of Oregon.  Accordingly, Reclamation intends to negotiate a contract for architect and engineering services with the District to further Reclamation's progress in meeting its habitat improvement obligations by enhancing the District's abilities to complete relevant planning and design activities.  The participation of the District in project planning and design will assure local coordination and input to projects, expedite project completion, and increase the opportunity for implementing a broader range of projects.  These projects should ultimately lead to greater adoption of improved watershed practices within the community.  In addition, Reclamation's contract with the District is expected to enhance program work by providing: improved knowledge of the study area and subbasins; familiarity with the subbasins' natural, cultural and recreational resource status, problems, and needs (existing and potential); local understanding of Reclamation's responsibilities under the December 2000 Biological Opinion; engagement of the various publics who have an interest in the development and management of water resources that may be affected by activities pursued under BiOp Action Item #149; and coordinated use of pertinent studies, reports, GIS databases, and maps of the area.  Reclamation believes that the District is uniquely qualified to provide these services, as it has legal jurisdiction, direct management responsibilities, expertise, and special knowledge in planning, design and implementation of fish habitat improvement facilities and measures in the John Day River sub-basins.  In addition, the District is closely familiar with specific fish passage problems related to agricultural activities and has developed working relationships with landowners and other organizations involved with habitat enhancement throughout the sub-basins.  Furthermore, Reclamation has previously worked cooperatively with the District to complete successful demonstration projects in the sub-basins.  As a result, a contract to enhance the District's continued involvement and Reclamation's close coordination with their ongoing local program will ensure that program continuity is maintained, applicable State and Federal standards are met, and fish and wildlife interests, enhancement opportunities, and issues are clearly identified, prioritized, and dealt with accordingly.  Because of the District's unique qualifications and position in subbasin habitat enhancement relative to Reclamation's needs for the above-referenced services, Reclamation intends to negotiate the contract using less than full and open competition procedures.  The period of performance of the contract will be for fiscal years 2003 through 2007, with contract funding availability and amounts to be determined annually.  No solicitation is available. Parties who believe they have knowledge of the John Day ESA Habitat Program and related landowner issues sufficient to provide relevant AE services may send an SF 254/255 demonstrating their firm's qualifications to the address listed above. No phone or fax inquiries will be considered.

<SUBJECT>M -- A76 ROLLER RECOVERY AND INK MANUFACTURING
<SOLNBR>BEP-03-0021
<RESPDATE>121302
<CONTACT>Robert Knauer, Contracting Officer, Phone (202)874-5827, Fax (202)874-3135, Email Robert.Knauer@bep.treas.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is issuing this NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT for an A-76 study being performed at our Washington, DC and Fort Worth, Texas locations. In response to the announced Commercial Activity study of 30 positions covering Ink Making and Roller Recovery, this action will comply with the ?current? procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, the "Commercial Activities" program. Services involved are described below for each functional element. A cost comparison will be performed later in the calendar year to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the ink making and roller recovery services performed by Government.  Therefore, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is seeking vendors nationwide that have the capability, background, skilled personnel, past experience and resources to provide the Bureau with two distinct functions:Ink Manufacturing and Roller Recovery operations.  

Ink Manufacturing is located at two geographic locations (Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX).  The Washington and Fort Worth facilities both produce a variety of different inks each year for use in the production of U.S. currency.  The inks produced are 1) intaglio inks used on intaglio printing presses and 2) high security inks for use on letterpress presses.  The equipment used to produce the different types of inks includes automated batching systems for weighing ink ingredients, industrial mixers of varying capacities and high-pressure three-roll mills for complete dispersion of raw materials.  Since the quality of the inks produced at the Bureau is very critical, a testing laboratory staffed with full-time chemists is maintained in the section to perform certification tests on all ink batches.  Inks must pass the respective tests before they can be used in currency presses.  In addition to regular ink production, the Ink Manufacturing Section also provides technical support for the development of new and experimental inks. (NOTE:  The ink chemists and technical support staff who do ink development are NOT currently included in the number of positions subject to our A-76 analysis, since they are members of the Office of Technical Support and not the Office of Production Support as are the ink makers.)

Roller Recovery Section Operation: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing?s Roller Recovery Section produces wiper rolls and inking-in rolls for the cylinder wipe, intaglio printing presses used to print U.S. currency. To fabricate a wiper roll, three distinct layers (different formulations and physical properties) of PVC (polyvinylchloride) material are applied to a steel wiper roll core using special application and curing procedures. First,  raw materials are mixed together to make the various formulations of PVC coatings.  Then, the PVC is applied to the roll.  Following application of the PVC layers, the wiper roll surfaces are finished and polished in a lathe to obtain specific dimensions and surface finish.  To produce a wiper roll that meets the physical requirements of operating on high-speed currency presses, the Roller Recovery Section closely monitors the quality of both incoming raw materials and the PVC formulations of the respective wiper roll layers. Operation of the PVC coating machines and the mechanical soundness and condition of wiper roll cores are also monitored very closely.  When completed, all wiper rolls undergo a series of final quality inspections to assess the bonding of PVC layers, hardness and surface defects.  In addition to regular wiper roll production, the Roller Recovery Section also provides technical support for the development of experimental rolls needed for new inks and currency design features.    

ACTION REQUIRED: It is requested that any vendor in the United States having the skilled personnel, talent, capability, resources and past experience to provide the above service and operation of these functions provide by email the following information to the point of contract indicated in this notice, Mr. ROBERT KNAUER.  Please provide:

1. Name of Company Contract
2. Phone and Fax numbers
3. Email addresses
4. Company Website address
5. At least six (6) commercial and government references that can verify that your firm has done the type of work contemplated and that provides information about the quality of your past performance. Include the following information for each contract:

1. Name of Contracting Activity or Customer
2. Contract Number or Other Identification Number
3. Contract Type
4. Total Contract Value or Volume
5. Description of Service 
6. Contracting Officer Point of Contact and Telephone Number
7. Technical/Project Manager Point of Contact and Telephone Number
8. Provide a brief (2page) description of your firm?s history and organization and a description of its facilities, products, services, and customers as they relate to performance of pre-and post-award contracting for the commercial and Government.

AGAIN, NO SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  This is for information on source availability only.   No site visits or pre-solicitation conference will be held until a determination of source availability is made by this Office.  If a contract should be awarded as a result of any A76 competition, it will be because the cost of contracting is lower than the cost of continued Government performance as prescribed in the current OMB A76 Circular and Revised Supplemental Handbook.  All Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. The successful offeror shall provide all management, supervision, quality control, coordination, personnel and labor to perform the above services. Due to the type of work conducted in BEP, it is required that contractor?s personnel be United States citizens. Additionally, some of the functions involve working with sensitive information; therefore, all company personnel must be eligible for a full access security clearance. It is anticipated that there will be one procurement action required to complete this action, if the cost comparison results in contract award. The expected term of the contract shall be an initial one-year award and four one-year options with a total contract period not-to-exceed 60 months.  A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.

<DESC>Sources are sought in research and development by the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division (AFRL/MNMF) for the Focused Ordnance Controller with Aimpoint Selection (FOCAS) exploratory development program which intends to develop a next generation active imaging fuze sensor for use with directional surface- and air-target warheads.  The objective of this program will be to design, simulate, fabricate, and test a mass focused ordnance controller that will enable air-delivered munitions to select the most lethal target aimpoint for electrically aimed kill mechanisms. The three critical areas of this program will be as follows: a high fidelity weapon launch-to-fragment impact simulation, a robust warhead fire control algorithm, and an active imaging fuze sensor design with sufficient resolution for target detection, classification and warhead aimpoint selection.    A robust design is needed that will function correctly in the presence of battlefield Electronic Countermeasures (ECM), Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), battlefield obscurants, and adverse weather.  This program will emphasize development of a robust design backed by high fidelity computer simulations and the demonstration of critical components integrated in breadboard fashion.  At this time, we are requesting information packages from potential sources on their capability to perform design and development of this next generation imaging fuze and directional ordnance controller concept. Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineers and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer; (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration.

<DESC>This is a sources-sought synopsis. This sources-sought synopsis request information is being conducted in anticipation of a potential future procurement program.  The intent of the announcement is to assist in the identification of existing commercial or military boats/craft that may be considered as candidates to fulfill a set of newly established requirements.  It is anticipated that a quantity of up to 50 craft may ultimately be procured, for implementation as replacements of the Landing Craft, Mechanized (otherwise known as "LCM(8)") platforms currently in service with the Maritime Prepositiong Ships of the Military Sealift Command (MSC).  Information from potential sources of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), non-developmental item (NDI) craft employing robust commercial design and/or intended for military application is desired.   U.S. manufacturers, and foreign firms with U .S. license production agreements, who desire to participate in this market investigation should submit information for any product(s) that are believed to satisfy or exceed the objectives delineated below.  Information for existing craft (i.e., designs having production examples) that meet, or can be made to meet, the following objectives is preferred over information related to conceptual design offerings.  The candidate craft must be capable of the following mission objectives: 1) safe transfer of up to 30 personnel and baggage from a MSC ship to undeveloped shoreline and return, with an expected standoff distance from shore of at least 25 miles; 2) conducting intentional beach landings for transfer of personnel and material, through the use of a self-contained ramp or brow; 3) providing medical evacuation to or from ship to undeveloped shoreline for at least two injured ind ividuals, a Corpsman and medical equipment, in a stable and secure condition; 4) conducting bottom survey in a surf zone, including the capability of subsequently transmitting survey findings to ship or shore; 5) providing afloat protection to MSC vessels while on station, through an inherent capability to mount weapons of up to .50 caliber, i.e., M2-HB Browning machine gun(s).  Note: In contrast to the LCM(8), the candidate craft will NOT be required to retain the ability to transport any tracked or wheeled vehicles as cargo, only personnel and associated equipment.  The candidate craft must be capable of the following performance objectives: 1) maintaining a top speed of at least 25 knots in a full-load condition; 2) being operated without limitation in environmental conditions of Sea State 2, as defined at http://www.boats.dt.navy.mil/SeaStateChart.pdf; 3) surviving in Sea S tate 5, as defined at http://www.boats.dt.navy.mil/SeaStateChart.pdf.  The candidate craft must be capable of the following interoperability objectives: 1) the ability to be loaded and transported onboard any of the 16 existing MSC Maritime Prepositioning Ships.
