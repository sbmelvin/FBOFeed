<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for a Phase II research and development study entitled, “Centerline Generic Nutation Study, Phase II.”	The proposed research is a follow-on effort to a previous study entitled, “Nutation Behavior of Spinning Space Vehicles with On-Board Propellant Study (NASA Contract No. CC89827B)”.   Phase 1 consisted of design and analysis tasks dealing with the creation of a test tank and the modification of the Spinning Slosh Test Rig to accommodate centerline mounted tank investigations.   Phase 2 will require the final design and manufacture of a generic test tank and the modification of the Spinning Slosh Test Rig (SSTR) to allow data collection for centerline-mounted tank configurations.  The test tank requirements have changed somewhat from the Phase 1 requirements and this will necessitate some rework of Phase 1 design and analysis.  Tests will be run using the new test tank and the modified SSTR per the test matrix below. The test data will be analyzed, correlated, and combined in a form that is useful for application to current and future spacecraft programs. Gaps in the knowledge base will be identified and approaches to filling those gaps will be outlined.	Of particular interest is the generation of model parameters for spacecraft with centerline (spin-axis) mounted fuel tanks.  All results from the testing will be presented in a report at the completion of the study. NASA/KSC intends to purchase these professional services from Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), 6220 Culebra Road, San Antonio, TX  78238, Email: sgreen@swri.org; Web: http://www.swri.com This sole source procurement is entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.	  SwRI has the unique expertise as the design agency and developer of the SSTR to successfully implement the described tasks. SwRI generated the design concept for the SSTR, built the SSTR, and performed all of the required strength and failure modes and effects analyses to support the operation of the SSTR. SwRI has successfully used the SSTR to generate critical data in support of three NASA expendable launch vehicle missions; GENESIS, CONTOUR, and STEREO. The NASA-owned SSTR that SwRI developed, built and tested is the only one of its kind in the aerospace industry. Due to the uniqueness of the SSTR, it is the only existing hardware that can meet the requirements of this task, and SwRI has unique expertise to perform the test and analysis. Previous research was performed during the concept study phase of building a spin test facility, and SwRI was determined to be the only organization that could meet the technical and schedule requirements in support of the GENESIS mission. With the hardware built, tested and operated in support of two NASA missions, it is obvious the SSTR is the only asset that can satisfy the requirements of this task. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item/service using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on  January 31, 2005.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for research and development entitled, “Quick Look Downrange Overflight Risk Assessment Tool.”  The goal of this task is to deliver a suite of tools, based in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment, which will allow NASA to perform simple risk calculations specifically for near trajectory risk to downrange populations.	CORAL will serve as the main risk estimation tool; however, work will be required to migrate the current research-oriented software tool to a user oriented platform.  A population extraction tool will leverage LandScan Global Population data to construct a seamless population corridor for any sample trajectory.  In addition to population data, a library of casualty areas for generic launch vehicles will allow NASA to estimate debris hazards without performing complex debris catalog verification.  Lastly, a trajectory library will assist NASA in estimating an impact trace and corridor width based on a simple trajectory.  The following tasks will be performed during the study:  (1) Conduct a kickoff meeting to discuss tasking, schedule and deliverables. Useful discussion topics include: launch vehicles previously selected and why, trajectory selection, and sample payloads. The intended use of RTI downrange risk tools within the scope of launch vehicle selection will also be addressed. Obtain a copy of ESRI’s ArcView 9.0.  (2) Code the main risk processes and algorithms within CORAL into a user oriented software suite. Particular attention will be paid to user interface, ease of use, and future supportability.  (3) Create a population extraction tool that assembles population data based on LandScan 2002 population data from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The tool will be designed to ensure any risk estimate using LandScan population data is computed using a seamless population coverage along the ground trace of a launch vehicle. (4) Compile casualty area estimates for sample launch vehicles. Casualty areas for sample generic payloads based on dimensions and weights will also be provided.  Integrate this set of casualty areas into the downrange risk estimation toolset as user selectable inputs. (5) Compute sample impact traces and estimate corridor widths based on each vehicle. Integrate this set of impact traces and corridor widths into the downrange risk estimation toolset as user selectable inputs. (6) Perform software testing on the integrated toolset to ensure results match output from original CORAL algorithms. (7) Finalize documentation for the downrange risk estimation toolset.  (8) Prepare lesson plans for downrange risk estimation toolset training. Training will include installation and use of the downrange risk estimation toolset. NASA/KSC intends to purchase these professional services from RTI International, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709-2194; Email: jmendonca@rti.org; Web: http://www.rti.org This sole source procurement is entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.	  The product required from RTI is a quick look downrange overflight risk assessment toolset to include a global population database, generic vehicle casualty area estimates, and associated sample trajectories.  Overflight risk estimation tools developed and used by RTI are the result of rigorous analyses tasks that have been performed by RTI for the USAF 45th Space Wing, the FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation, and NASA Wallops Flight Facility. Thus, past projects have given RTI a high fidelity baseline upon which to develop a quick-look toolset. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the government to conduct this effort with RTI based on their skills and knowledge of overflight risk assessments and based on the application of this study to the LSP office needs: this work would allow the LSP office to perform simple risk calculations for downrange populations in their launch services selection process.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item/service using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for a research and development study entitled, “Debris Survivability Feasibility Study.”  The goal of this study is to use a computational fluids approach to assess current methods of predicting ablation. Focus will then turn to consideration of a more appropriate heating environment and its effects on sample debris fragments. Based on the results of the study and experience with sample debris, the Contractor will determine whether an engineering level tool would be useful when accounting for ablation effects on realistic launch vehicle debris. The following tasks will be performed during the study:  (1) Hold a kickoff meeting to discuss tasking and scheduling. (2) Examine current CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) codes and select a package that accounts for hypersonic flow phenomena. Since many CFD codes are research quality projects supported by universities, free CFD packages are readily available. However, post-processing tools are usually limited in capability. RTI would obtain copies of relevant CFD codes and purchase any software needed for post-processing. (3) Study current methods of predicting heat accumulation for debris fragments, paying particular attention to ablation model assumptions. (4) Exercise CFD models for two debris fragments with different shapes, and compare heating results to assumptions made in current ablation models. (5) Investigate the feasibility of developing an engineering level tool for estimating debris survivability. Assess the level of effort needed to develop a tool capable of predicting ablation effects consistent in fidelity with the needs of typical launch risk analyses. NASA/KSC intends to purchase these professional services from RTI International, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709-2194; Email: jmendonca@rti.org; Web: http://www.rti.org This sole source procurement is entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.	  RTI International is the leading expert in developing debris/fragmentation models for flight safety organizations at the USAF 45th Space Wing and the FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation. Therefore, past projects have given RTI unique insight into the technical issues associated with the subject of this study. Additionally, the RTI-developed debris models for various launch vehicles will serve as a foundation for this analysis. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the government to conduct this effort with RTI based on their skills and knowledge of debris analysis and based on the application of this study to the LSP office needs: this work would help the LSP office to better estimate the debris risk associated with all flights, including nuclear payloads (e.g. New Horizons – Pluto).

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for research and development entitled, “Quick Look Launch Service Selection Tool.”  The goal of this task is to deliver a suite of tools, based in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment, which will allow NASA to visualize debris hazards in the form of impact footprints for any combination of vehicle, launch pad, and azimuth. The user would enter simple vehicle and mission parameters and be shown areas potentially hazarded by inert and explosive debris. The user would be flagged if an existing impact limit line were compromised. The following tasks will be performed during the study:   (1)  Hold a kickoff meeting  to discuss tasking and scheduling.  Useful discussion topics include: launch vehicles and payload characteristics of interest and trajectory selection. Tasking will be modified as necessary.  (2) Compile vehicle data based on the types of vehicles NASA has identified as likely candidates for selection. Review PLATER methodology and verify that the methodology is applicable for vehicles of interest.  (3) Code the main risk processes and algorithms within PLATER into a user oriented software suite. Particular attention will be paid to user interface, ease of use, and future supportability. (4) Perform software testing on the integrated toolset to ensure results match output from original PLATER algorithms. (5) Finalize software documentation for the launch service selection toolset.  (6) Prepare lesson plans for launch service selection toolset training. Training will include installation and use of the launch service selection toolset. NASA/KSC intends to purchase these professional services from RTI International, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709-2194; Email: jmendonca@rti.org; Web: http://www.rti.org This sole source procurement is entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.	  The product  required from RTI is a quick look Launch Service Selection Tool aimed at  assessment of the launch area risks associated with a given vehicle, launch pad and azimuth. Full blown launch area risk estimates and debris impact footprints require mission specific data including: detailed vehicle and payload characteristics, breakup debris characteristics, nominal and off nominal vehicle trajectories, tumble turn data, launch pad, launch and flight azimuth, and wind data. Typical launch area risk estimates take between six to ten months assuming all relevant data is complete and accurate. Payload customers shopping for a launch vehicle cannot afford to use higher fidelity public risk estimates in their decision making process.  In 1996, RTI proposed a Preliminary Launch-Analysis Template for Elbow Room (PLATER) method of quickly visualizing the debris impact footprint for a variety of vehicles launched at various azimuths. If the impact footprints exceeded the bounds of the impact limit lines, there was a good chance that public risk would be unacceptable given a full-blown risk assessment.	The method was originally used by the United States Air Force to assess the usability, from a launch safety standpoint, of inactive launch pads or undeveloped real estate on Cape Canaveral. This RTI-developed method, coupled with RTI’s extensive experience in “full-blown” launch area risk assessments for the United States Air Force and the FAA, provide evidence that it is in the best interest of the government to conduct this effort with RTI based on their experience and knowledge, and based on the application of this study to the NASA office needs: this work would allow NASA to enter simple vehicle and mission parameters and be shown areas potentially hazarded by inert and explosive debris. The user would be flagged if an existing impact limit line were compromised.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item/service using FAR Part 12.

Summary of Requirements; IV. Data Needs and Requirements; V. Technical Support; VI. Proposal Format; VII. Price Schedule; VIII. Source Selection and Evaluation Criteria; IX. Applicability of FAR Regulations and  Provisions; X.  Special Proposal Requirements; XI. Submission of Offerors’ Questions; XII. Point of Contact; XIII. Submission of Offers; and XIV. Handcarried Proposals.    I. INTRODUCTION  - The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, is soliciting proposals for data and data services pertaining to the U.S. Domestic and International Aviation System. GAO uses these data and services to respond to requests from Congress to examine various aspects of the nation’s and the global aviation system. The data sought by GAO includes airline financial, operating, and scheduling information.  II.  BACKGROUND - GAO exists to support the Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the American people. Nearly all of its work is mandated in legislation, requested by the chairs or ranking minority members of congressional committees or subcommittees, or requested by individual members. GAO is responsible for conducting research and providing information that helps Congress address both short-term, immediate policy issues, and issues that are newly emerging, longer-term in nature, broad in scope, and have implications across the government. The Congress looks to GAO to turn assertions and information into facts and knowledge. The three core values that underlie GAO work are integrity, reliability, and accountability.  III. SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS  - Over the past several years Congress has requested that GAO examine a number of different aspects of the U.S. and international aviation industry. These requests have covered issues relating to both international and domestic service, as well as passenger and cargo air service. Recent reports includes:  (1) Commercial Aviation: Legacy Airlines Must Further Reduce Costs to Restore Profitability (GAO-04-836, 8/11/04);  (2) Transatlantic Aviation: Effects of Easing Restrictions on U.S.-European Markets (GAO-04-835, 7/21/04);  (3) Summary Analysis of Federal Commercial Aviation Taxes (GAO-04-406R, 3/12/04);  and (4) Commercial Aviation: Issues Regarding Federal Assistance for Enhancing Air Service to Small Communities (GAO-03-540T, 3/11/2000).  These reports are available online at www.gao.gov.  These reports required GAO to analyze data on airfares, passenger traffic, service quantity and quality, the market strength of various airlines, competition issues, the use of regional jets, airline ticket practices, and proposed airline mergers. GAO currently has requests from Congress to do additional work in these areas, and expects Congress will continue to request studies that require analysis of this type of information.  IV.  DATA NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS - GAO needs both Aviation Scheduling Data and DOT Aviation Data access to airline financial, operating, and scheduling data, and software that enables us to obtain the information (a) at the individual airline level, (b) at various levels of aggregation (e.g. total industry analysis, airport or market specific analysis, equipment specific), and (c) for various time periods. The data available should include both historic data (e.g. financial data back to at least 1978) and the most recently available data (e.g. scheduling data for the 12-month period beginning the month the contract is awarded). The contractor must be able to update all of the data as it becomes available to them (e.g. monthly updates for scheduling data). The contractor must provide complete definitions of the data elements provided, including numeric or alphabetic codes used in various data sets (e.g. location identification numbers for airports). There are three attachments (Description of Aviation Data Requirements by GAO, Required Form 41, OD1A/b, T100, and Commuter Data) that provide a more detailed descriptions of the data required (these attachments are included in the Executive Summary and obtainable by requesting a copy of the document).   V. TECHNICAL SUPPORT – The contractor must make staff available for support and technical assistance – either in person, by telephone, or other electronic means of communication as appropriate – to respond to questions from GAO staff regarding both the data and the software used to access it. Technical support and assistance must be available within normal business hours (9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard or Daylight Time).  The contractor must provide data of high quality in terms of accuracy and completeness. The contractor must also provide documentation of the steps they use to ensure the quality of the data, including any changes made to the data reported by air carriers, or any department, agency, or bureau of the U.S. Government.  The data must be accessible either on-line or provided on CD. Analysts must be able to access the data either on individual personal computers, or through the GAO network. The software must be compatible with a Microsoft 2000 operating system, and updated versions of this operating system. The software provided by the contractor must allow GAO staff to produce output in a format that can be easily imported into a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) and statistical programs (Statistical Analysis System/SAS, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences/SPSS); the ability to produce output in d-base formats (.dbf extension files) is preferable.  The contractor must also provide GAO staff with training and documentation explaining the data and how to use the software. Initial training must be provided within one month of the contract award date or as agreed between the parties.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source simplified acquisition under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b) to National Instruments of Austin, TX. This acquisition is for volume licenses and maintenance for LabView Full Development Systems FDS for Windows, LabView FDS for Macintosh, LabView FDS for Linux, and LabView Windows CVI for Windows for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Office of the Director, Enterprise Systems Division. LabView/CVI software from National Instruments is the graphical development environment for creating flexible and scalable test, measurement, and control applications rapidly and at minimal cost. With LabVIEW, engineers and scientists interface with real-world signals, analyze data for meaningful information, and share results and applications. Regardless of experience, LabVIEW makes development fast and easy for all users. LabView delivers a powerful graphical development environment for signal acquisition, measurement analysis, and data presentation, and provides the flexibility of a programming language without the complexity of traditional development tools. No other known commercial code has these capabilities. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received by 1:00p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) January 31, 2005, will be considered by the Government. No RFQ package is available. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for the award of a contract for the construction of the Covered Departure/Arrival Airport Control Group (D/AACG) Facility; Electronic and Information T echnology (EIT) Accessibility Exception.  The project consists of the construction work necessary to construct an expansion to the existing Departure/Arrival Airport Control Group Facility, a new Covered Ready Line Building and new Marshalling Area Pavemen ts.  The D/AACG expansion shall include a Joint Inspection Lane, a lane for a future pallet scale and a lane with a moving axle scale.  New supporting facilities include supporting utilities, concrete approaches to buildings, interior finishes, water suppl y, sewer, HVAC, electric service, exterior and or security lighting, parking, storm drainage, communications, fire protection and detection systems, access roads, apron, fencing, signage, landscaping, paving, walks, curbs, information systems, and general site improvements.  The estimated cost of this project is between $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.  The facility is located at Fort Drum, New York at the Wheeler-Sack Army Airfield (WSAAF).  The selected contractor must complete the entire work ready for us e no later than 425 calendar days after the date the contractor receives the Notice to Proceed, except in case the Contracting Officer determines that seeding is not feasible during the construction period, the Contractor shall accomplish such seeding in t he first planting period following the contract completion date. This action will not operate to extend the performance time for the balance of the work.  The time stated for completion shall include final cleanup of the premises.  If the contractor fails to complete the work within the time specified in the contract, or any extension, the contractor shall pay to the Government as liquidated damages, the sum of $750.00 for each day of delay.  When the solicitation is issued, Section 00800 will set forth the  contractor-furnished EIT equipment requirements of the contract.  The estimated cost of the EIT equipment is $5,000.00.  FAR Part 39.2 requires that federal agencies ensure that any EIT purchased is accessible to federal workers and persons with disabilit ies and implements Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.  It incorporates standards developed by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) in acquisition planning, market research, and describing age ncy needs and adds the requirement that acquisition of EIT supplies and services meet the Board accessibility standards at 36 CFR Part 1194.  FAR 39.204 contains five exceptions to the EIT accessibility requirements; one of which, FAR 39.204c is for EIT a cquired by a contractor incidental to the contract.  In this instance, the purpose of the contract is construction and the EIT equipment is an inconsequential portion of the contract specifications.  Therefore, pursuant to FAR 39.204c the EIT purchased un der the subject solicitation and resultant contract is exempt from the Access Board standards at 36 CFR Part 1194.  This procurement is being solicited as a competitive HubZone set-aside.  The applicable NAICS Code is 237990 with a small business size stan dard of $28.5 million.  The media selected for the issuance of solicitations and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project are the Internet and CD-ROM. Paper copies of this solicitation , and amendments, if any, will not be available or issued. Interested parties may download and print the solicitation, at no charge at http://www.nan.usace.army.mil.  Click on the Red Box labeled Contract & Bid, go to Advertised Solicitations, click on s olicitation #W912DS-05-B-0007, then click on plans.pdf and specs.pdf to view the plans and specifications, respectively. Project specification files and dra wings are portable document files (PDF) and can be viewed, navigated, or printed using Abode Acrobat Reader.

The following is a summary of the major changes: 1)  Section K, AFMC 5352.215-9007 USE OF NON-GOVERNMENT ADVISORS (AFMC) (NOV  1998), the following list of firms supplying non-government advisors was added  to the clause: Anteon International Corporation ARINC Incorporated Camber Corporation General Dynamics Corporation MTC Technologies Sumaria Systems, Inc. 2)  Several changes were made to Section L.  Passages in green type represent  third amendment changes.  Red type still represents first amendment changes,  and blue type still represents second amendment changes.  Offerors should not  rely only upon the color coding system to identify changes;  all offerors are  responsible for adhering to all instructions provided in the original RFP and  all amendments.   The major changes to Section L are as follows: 1)  References to a "C" type contract with options were replaced with  appropriate IDIQ language.   2)  Additional instructions for the cross-reference matrices are provided in  Paragraph 2.1.5.8.   3)  Additional information regarding the packing procedure is provided under  Paragraph 3.3.1 (b) (6). 4)  It became apparent that it would be impractical to draw numbers at the time  of proposal receipt. Therefore, in the paragraph 3.3.3 (e), the following  sentence, "Offerors will draw a number at delivery of the proposal to determine  the sequence of the evaluation." is replaced with "Through random selection,  the Government will determine the order in which the seats will be evaluated.   Offerors will be provided an approximate date for the beginning of their seat  evaluation via email once Volume II - Past Performance of their proposal is  received."   5)  The following passage was added to paragraph 2.1.5.4 (g), "This restriction  does not apply to PDF files submitted for the Pedigree documentation.  For the  Pedigree documentation, PDF files with textual search and copy functions shall  be submitted to the maximum extent practicable.  However, in situations where  submitting an "image" is the only option available, it is acceptable to do  so."   If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POC+s listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// Update (1-11-05) CONTRACT TYPE CHANGED TO IDIQ ON-LINE CERTIFICATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS APPLICATION (ORCA) REQUIREMENT ADDED CLARIFICATION REGARDING PAST PERFORMANCE The Government has amended the RFP to change the contract type from a "C" type  contract to an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.   As these changes are essentially a restructuring of the pricing tables from  within the H clauses to Pricing Exhibits and a change in ordering procedures,  no RFP schedule changes are being made.  These changes are hereby posted as the  second amendment to the RFP.  In addition, the Government has enacted a few  other changes in order to comply with the new ORCA requirement that became  effective on 1 Jan 2005.   As a result, the following documents have been changed: 1)  The model contract 2)  Section K, Certifications and Representations 2)  Section L   The changes in the clauses in the model contract are listed in these two  documents, ESUP_Previous_Section_H_vs_Pricing_Exhibits.doc and  ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc.  Several exhibits, e.g. PA-PQ, have  been created to replace the majority of the H clauses, and are included in  the .pdf version of the model contract.  In addition, MS Excel versions of  the documents have been posted on PIXS in .zip file,  ESUP_IDIQ_Pricing_Exhibits.zip.  If you are unable to access the Excel files,  please contact one of the contractual POC+s listed below for assistance.     Offerors are asked to utilize the new tabular format for the pricing.  The  tables may need to be adjusted, changed to landscape mode, etc. to accommodate  your dollar values.  This is a perfectly acceptable approach.   The DD Form  1423+s, Exhibit A, include the changes from Amendment 1. Exhibit B is the list  of support equipment that originally appeared in SCR H-118.  The Statement of  Objectives, Attachment 1, has not been changed, but is serving as a placeholder  for the contractor proposed Statement of Work. A paragraph with information regarding ORCA has also been posted as  ORCA_Information.doc.  The clause added to Section K can be found within that  section and is referenced in the ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc  document. Section L has been posted in its entirety with all the Amendment 1 and  Amendment 2 changes incorporated.  Amendment 1 changes are in red; Amendment 2  changes are in blue.   Due to an ambiguity in the RFP regarding the Past Performance Questionnaires,  the Government would like to highlight a couple key passages from the original  RFP, and two key changes to the RFP document.   In paragraph 4.1.1 (b) (6),  Section L of the RFP states "All Past Performance Questionnaire Tracking  Records shall be submitted with the offeror+s proposal as an addendum to Volume  II.  This exchange/contact between the offeror and its POCs shall cease upon  submission of the offeror’s proposal to the Government in response to this  RFP."  In Attachment 4 to Section L, it states, "We are seeking at least two  POC’s, per relevant contract, to submit a completed Present/Past Performance  Questionnaire directly to the Government no later than [OFFEROR FILL-IN RFP  CLOSING DATE (30th calendar day after RFP release)]."  Because these statements  do not provide a clear and unequivocal cutoff date for receipt of the Past  Performance questionnaires, the Government has amended these passages to remove  the ambiguities/discrepancies.  The due date for Past Performance  questionnaires is the RFP closing date of 31 Jan 2005 at 12:00 pm EST.  In  addition, the phone and fax numbers associated with submittal of these  documents has been changed to reflect the current location of the Government  POC.  Offerors may need to contact their potential  respondents to ensure that  the respondents have the correct phone and fax numbers.  Also, as was  previously mentioned, a list identifying respondents to Past Performance  Questionnaires will be provided to each respective offeror in the near future  to aid in your tracking of these responses.

In addition, answers to various questions and clarifications  have also been posted to clarify the changes found in the amendment and to  respond to questions or clarifications that did not result in a change to the  RFP.   An amendment changing the contract type from a "C" type contract to an "IDIQ"  type contract is still planned to be released in the near future.  Due to the  potential for inclement weather and various other factors, this amendment may  be released following the December 25th holiday rather than before.  For the  convenience of the offerors, this amendment will be a re-release of all  documents and will include all changes set forth in the first amendment as well  as those changes planned for the second amendment.

These two documents are for informational purposes only and have been  posted to provide insight into some of the changes made from the second draft  to the final solicitation.

The documents are now in the  proper order and several "Draft" notations have been removed.  No other changes  have been made to the document.  Please note that this is a huge file, and may  not open in your browser window in a timely manner.  You may need to save the  file to your computer prior to reviewing the documentation. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (11-30-04) FINAL RFP RELEASE The final RFP is hereby released.  Please note Section L was accidently  duplicated and there are two identical file copies.  In addition, the document  sections, most notably, the PCO letters, are out of order due to software  glitches. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (11-05-04) SECTION L AND M, CLINs and SECTION H POSTED All interested parties are asked to review the Sections L, M, and H and the  CLINs and provide questions and comments to the contractual POC listed below at  your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm EST on 11 Nov 2004.

As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

Passages in green type represent  third amendment changes.  Red type still represents first amendment changes,  and blue type still represents second amendment changes.  Offerors should not  rely only upon the color coding system to identify changes;  all offerors are  responsible for adhering to all instructions provided in the original RFP and  all amendments.   The major changes to Section L are as follows: 1)  References to a "C" type contract with options were replaced with  appropriate IDIQ language.   2)  Additional instructions for the cross-reference matrices are provided in  Paragraph 2.1.5.8.   3)  Additional information regarding the packing procedure is provided under  Paragraph 3.3.1 (b) (6). 4)  It became apparent that it would be impractical to draw numbers at the time  of proposal receipt. Therefore, in the paragraph 3.3.3 (e), the following  sentence, "Offerors will draw a number at delivery of the proposal to determine  the sequence of the evaluation." is replaced with "Through random selection,  the Government will determine the order in which the seats will be evaluated.

In Attachment 4 to Section L, it states, "We are seeking at least two  POC’s, per relevant contract, to submit a completed Present/Past Performance  Questionnaire directly to the Government no later than [OFFEROR FILL-IN RFP  CLOSING DATE (30th calendar day after RFP release)]."  Because these statements  do not provide a clear and unequivocal cutoff date for receipt of the Past  Performance questionnaires, the Government has amended these passages to remove  the ambiguities/discrepancies.  The due date for Past Performance  questionnaires is the RFP closing date of 31 Jan 2005 at 12:00 pm EST.  In  addition, the phone and fax numbers associated with submittal of these  documents has been changed to reflect the current location of the Government  POC.  Offerors may need to contact their potential  respondents to ensure that  the respondents have the correct phone and fax numbers.  Also, as was  previously mentioned, a list identifying respondents to Past Performance  Questionnaires will be provided to each respective offeror in the near future  to aid in your tracking of these responses.

As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

<DESC>The Prevention Research Branch (PRB), an intramural research group of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), conducts research on child and adolescent health behavior.  One of the PRB areas of emphasis is assessment of the prevalence and determinants of health behavior among adolescents.  Toward this end the PRB plans to conduct a national school-based probability survey of U.S. 6th-10th graders that is also consistent with the requirements of the international Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey.  The HBSC survey is conducted among national or regional samples of students at ages 11, 13, and 15 years of age in about 35 countries.   The goal of the HBSC survey is to obtain data about adolescent health behavior and to make this information available so as to enable the improvement of health services and programs for youth. The goals of the U.S. survey are to provide health behavior information about adolescents nationally (U.S.-specific protocol) and to enable international comparisons by incorporating the mandatory HBSC protocol.  A survey consistent with the HBSC was conducted in the U.S. previously in 1997-1998 and 2001-2002.  In international comparisons, previous HBSC surveys showed that U.S. 15-year-old youth are less likely to smoke than students in most other countries surveyed, even though 13-year-old U.S. students experiment with tobacco in comparable proportions to youth in other countries.  The most recent survey demonstrated that U.S. youth are more likely to be overweight than students in the other HBSC countries.  U.S. eating habits were also shown to be less healthy with a comparatively high proportion of youth consuming high fat foods and soft drinks with sugar.  Analyses of the U.S. national data set have addressed bullying, unintentional injury, and utilization of health care.  The U.S. survey shall be conducted during the 2005-2006 school year and will address health-related factors according to rigorous protocols developed by the HBSC (to made available by June of 2005), and should also include additional factors and dimensions that are relevant to the U.S. experience.  The nationally-representative probability sample for the school-based survey requires a minimum of 1536 students/age group with mean ages 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 and a total of 5000 students with confidence intervals of 95% +/- 3% and a design factor of 1.2.   Over-sampling of racial minorities shall be required.  This is a time-sensitive requirement and will require a national network of data collectors.  Request For Proposal (RFP) RFP-NICHD-2005-08 will be available electronically on the FedBizOpps website at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/HHS/NIH (under National Institute of Child Health and Human Development) on or about January 26, 2005, and the proposals shall be due on or about March 09, 2005.  The NICHD does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP.  All responsible parties may submit a proposal which shall be considered for contract award.   The Government reserves the right to cancel the requirement at any time prior to contract award.

GENERAL

INTRODUCTION
Many of the problems of brick masonry, brought to the attention of the Brick Institute of America over the past years, have resulted from improper cleaning methods. Some walls have been irreparably damaged as a result of a lack of attention to cleaning details and procedures.
Cleaning failures generally fall into one of three categories: 
1. Failure to thoroughly saturate the brick masonry surface with water before and after application of chemical or detergent cleaning solutions. Dry masonry permits absorption of the cleaning solution and may result in "mortar smear", "white scum", or the development of efflorescence or "green stain". Saturation of the surface prior to cleaning reduces the absorption rate, permitting the cleaning solution to stay on the surface rather than be absorbed.
2. Failure to properly use chemical cleaning solutions. Improperly mixed or overly concentrated acid solutions can etch or wash out cementitious materials from the mortar joints. They have a tendency to discolor masonry units, particularly lighter shades, producing an appearance frequently termed "acid burn" and can also promote the development of "green" and "brown" stains. 
3. Failure to protect windows, doors, and trim. Many cleaning agents, particularly acid solutions, have a corrosive effect on metal. If permitted to come in contact with metal frames, the solutions may cause pitting of the metal or staining of the masonry surface and trim materials, such as limestone and cast stone.
Before the actual cleaning of a project begins, all cleaning procedures and solutions should be applied to a sample test area of approximately 20 sq. ft. (1.9 m2). The effectiveness of the cleaning agent should be judged by inspection of the sample test area after a period of not less than one week after application. The size of the test area may be larger, depending upon the cleaning procedure. The indiscriminate use of muriatic acid or the wrong proprietary compound can cause unsightly, difficult-to-remove stains. Reactions of brick and cleaning solutions are not always predictable and thus it is safer to use a trial-and-error method on a small test area before committing the entire project to a set procedure. Minute quantities of certain minerals found in some fired clay masonry units and materials, such as manganese, added to color brick may react with some solutions and cause staining. Sample testing should be performed under conditions of temperature and humidity that will closely approximate the conditions under which the brickwork will be cleaned. Chemical cleaning solutions are generally more effective when the outdoor temperature is 50 oF (10 oC) or above. 
Pressurized Water Cleaning
To cut labor costs, many cleaning contractors utilize pressurized water. Some pressure systems feature a pressure gun and nozzle equipped with a control switch. This setup permits the operator to apply solutions to a wall over 100 ft. (30.5 m) from the base unit. Other systems have two separate hoses - one with plain water and the other with a cleaning solution. Low pressure has been defined as 100 to 300 psi (700 to 2100 kPa), medium pressure as 300 to 700 psi (2100 to 4850 kPa) and high pressure as 700 psi (4850 kPa) or greater. A sand finish or a surface coating may be removed by pressurized water cleaning, resulting in a different appearance. Nozzle pressure in excess of 700 psi (4850 kPa) may damage brick units and erode mortar joints.
The following procedure is suggested:
1. Select and test the cleaning solution on a sample area. Check the equipment for cleaning solution compatibility. For proprietary compounds, mix in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Presoak wall.
3. Protect metal, glass, wood, limestone and cast stone surfaces. Mask or otherwise protect windows, doors, and ornamental trim from cleaning solutions.
4. Presoak or saturate the area to be cleaned. Flush with water, from the top down. Saturated brick masonry will not absorb the cleaning solution or dissolved mortar particles. Areas below should also be saturated in order to prevent absorption of the run-off from above
5. Application of cleaning solutions may be by a low pressure sprayer, 30 to 50 psi (200 to 350 kPa), or through the high pressure cleaning unit.
6. Permit the cleaning solution to remain on the wall for approximately 5 minutes.
7. Starting at the top, flush the wall down, as in the previous procedure.
Caution: It is possible for solutions to be driven into the masonry when applied under high pressure, and become the source of future staining. However, if the walls are sufficiently saturated with water before the solutions are applied, the risk of penetration is reduced. Experience has shown that this cleaning method has a high probability of changing the appearance of sand molded brick, sand- faced extruded brick, and brick with glazed coatings or slurries applied to the finished faces. The brick manufacturer should be consulted on the use of high pressure water cleaning of such brick.


SURFACE PREPARATION
 
********************************
Specifier Notes: Describe surface preparation of substrates required before application of water repellents.
********************************
 
A. Clean all dirt, oil, grease, mold, mildew, efflorescence, or any other coating or material from surfaces that interfere with penetration, performance, adhesion, or aesthetics of water repellents. Rinse thoroughly, using pressure water spray to remove cleaner residues. Allow surfaces to dry completely before application of water repellents.
 
B. Repair, patch, and fill all cracks, voids, defects, and damaged areas in surface as approved by the COR. Allow repair materials to cure completely before application of water repellents.
 C. Seal all open joints.
 D. Allow new masonry and concrete repairs and repointed surfaces to cure before application of water repellents

WATER REPELLENTS
. This specification covers preparation, materials, services, and equipment required for the application of Water Sealant products for projects involving either old or new construction.  Any substantial deviations shall be referred to the manufacturer or authorized representative. Product is manufactured in three strengths, which vary in solids content.  The determination of which formulation is appropriate is dependent upon the porosity of the substrate. Surface type may be concrete, brick, block, stone, stucco, wood and other porous building materials, which allow penetration of the sealant.

A. Surface Preparation: Contractor or Applicator shall be responsible for providing a clean, dry substrate free from oil, dirt, grease, efflorescence or any other coating which may inhibit penetration and adhesion of water repellent.  This requirement applies to new construction, renovation or remedial projects. Substrate must be completely dry prior to applying product.
B.  Environmental Requirements:
1. Temperature: Product may be applied at any temperature providing that there is no frozen moisture present in the substrate.  When applied at temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit the product may cure at a slower rate. Optimal temperatures should be above 40„a F (5„a C) or below 95„a F (35„a C).
2. Do not apply material if the substrate is wet or contains frozen moisture. Allow substrate to dry for a minimum of 48 hours after rain or power washing.
3. Do not apply material during inclement weather or if precipitation is expected within 12 hours.
4. Do not use spray methods of application under windy conditions.
 
C.     Protection:
1. Special precautions should be taken to avoid fumes from entering the building being treated. Ventilation systems and fresh air intakes should be turned off and covered.
2. Protect shrubs, metal, glass, vehicles, and other building hardware from overspray.

TEST PANELS
 
A. Before full-scale application, review manufacturer¡¦s product data sheets to determine the suitability of each product for the specific surfaces. Apply each water repellent to test panels to determine appropriate strength, coverage rates, compatibility, effectiveness, surface preparation, application procedures, and desired results.
 
B. Apply water repellents to test panels in accordance with manufacturer¡¦s written instructions. Allow 24 hours or until test panels are thoroughly cured before evaluating final appearance and results. Do not begin full-scale application until test panels are inspected and approved by the COR.

8: POSITION DESCRIPTION:


I.	Background

Armenia is a country in transition from the old Soviet system of laws, practices and attitudes to a free market economy and democratically oriented system of government. Although Armenia has made significant progress on the political, economic and social fronts, there is still much room for improvement and much need for continued international support. In addition to its transition efforts, Armenia is locked in a dispute with neighboring Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) region, which lies within Azerbaijan but is occupied by ethnic Armenians. There is currently a cease-fire but no permanent resolution to the dispute.

The U.S. Government (USG) assistance program in the Caucasus region as a whole is of particular strategic importance to the U. S. and enjoys high visibility and considerable interest from the public and private sectors alike. In the early years of USAID involvement in Armenia, assistance was largely focused on emergency assistance to the large number of vulnerable persons, including those displaced by the regions’ various conflicts. Subsequently, USAID programs increasingly focused on sustainable development in the governance, economics and social sectors. The portfolio of assistance activities is extensive, labor intensive, and requires close performance monitoring to ensure that it is having the desired impact.

In addition, USG engagement in Armenia is designed to promote regional economic integration and political cooperation in the southern Caucasus. Increased cooperation and successful integration are key factors needed to establish regional stability and as a counterweight to the crisis in the northern Caucasus, as well as to ensure better access to and sustainable use of the region's natural resources and to strengthen Armenia's linkages to the world economy.

II.	Introduction 

The USAID Mission in Yerevan has program responsibility for the formulation of country strategy and implementation of a program designed to foster a market economy and democratic society in Armenia. The Economic Restructuring & Energy Office (EREO) is currently responsible for managing over 30 activities in these program areas, with an OYB of $25-30 million. EREO staff currently consists of 2 USDH, 4 USPSCs and 5 FSNs.  The EREO portfolio is large, complex and can be divided into two major components: economic growth, and water and energy. The vast majority of the Senior Commercial Law Advisor’s attention will be focused on the former area.

In economic growth, USAID/Armenia’s goal is to support the growth of employment in a competitive private sector. Program components include:

1.	Reform of tax policy and administration, customs administration, and budget policy.
 
2.	Strengthening the bank supervision capacity of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA), as well as undertaking other actions that contribute to the establishment of a well functioning banking sector.

3.	Fostering the development of capital and financial markets.

4.	Promoting the passage and implementation of legal and regulatory reforms (and related institutional capacity building). This includes areas such as enterprise bankruptcy, government procurement, and leasing. It also addresses World Trade Organization (WTO) post-accession and harmonization, including intellectual property rights issues (IPR), competition policy, and telecommunications.

5.	Enterprise conversion to international accounting standards (IAS) and strengthening the local association of accountants and auditors.

6.	Technical assistance to small- and medium-sized enterprises, with an emphasis on agri-business, information technology and other promising sectors.

EREO must, to varying degrees, coordinate each of these activities with a large group of multilateral donors. These include the World Bank (WB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), International Finance Corporation (IFC), United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD), and EU/TACIS program. In addition, there are several bilateral agencies working in Armenia, including the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Germany’s Kreditanstalt für Wiederafbau (KfW) and Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), UK Department for International Development (DFID), and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), among others.

Additionally, most key counterparts in GOAM have been educated in the former Soviet system and have had relatively little international experience or education. A considerable amount of time must be devoted to re-orienting them to Western standards, particularly with regard to the implementation of a modern legal system.

POC:  Marcia Goldman, Contract Specialist (301) 496-2302 
DESC:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical and customer service capabilities of small businesses interested in providing dosimetry services to NIH. NIH possesses a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license authorizing its use of radioactive materials that includes requirements for performing routine monitoring for external occupational exposure, notification of individuals and their supervisors when exposures approach maximum permissible limits, and making recommendations for remedial action whenever appropriate.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government (the Customer), the Contractor shall furnish the personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies necessary to provide a comprehensive external exposure monitoring program, including associated services, in accordance with the requirements of the NIH license.  Through the Division of Radiation Safety (DRS), the Office of Research Services (ORS) provides radiation exposure monitoring services to NIH employees who utilize radioactive materials and radiation producing equipment in the course of their research.  The ORS is seeking organizations that can provide state of the art dosimetry equipment, timely reading and reporting of the monitoring results, and a comprehensive, interactive database from which historical and regulatory data may be readily obtained.  The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS Code 541380 size standard  6.0 million.  The ORS intends to award a new contract to the dosimetry provider whose services most adequately support the programs and the needs of the NIH.  Services that will be required by this procurement will include, but are not limited to, the furnishing of all personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies considered essential for providing all specified types of personal and environmental dosimeters, including dosimeter calibration, monitoring, and necessary associated services in accordance with NIH requirements.  These requirements shall include maintaining a Certificate of Accreditation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through its National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for all test categories applicable to whole-body, extremity, and environmental dosimeters.  Additional requirements include the ability to utilize existing NIH methodology for record keeping and identification of employees and lab groups, permitting direct computer access to personnel monitoring database(s) by DRS personnel, participation in a joint QA/QC program as directed by the DRS, and providing dosimetry equipment that is hermetically sealed such that it permits gas and/or liquid wash sterilization while guarding against damage from water and laboratory chemicals.  Additionally, qualified businesses should demonstrate a propensity for the development and incorporation of innovative and efficiency-improving systems, products, and customer service into their proposed dosimetry service.   An example would be the availability of operational or electronic dosimeter systems that allow for on-site management of personnel exposures.  Experience in managing similar dosimetry service contracts must be demonstrated. This market survey is being conducted through the CBD to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information. Responding firms should provide two (2) copies of their capability statement to the Office of Procurement Management at the address provided not later than February 7, 2005. Please send to the attention of Marcia Goldman, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 539A, Bethesda, Maryland  20892-7663



Basic Services:
 
1.  Whole Body Dosimeters:  Whole body monitoring systems will preferably use optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) or an equivalent technology.  The ideal system involves the use of a single monitor capable of detecting beta, gamma, and neutron radiations.  The monitor must be designed for "clip-on" attachment to a worker's clothing for use under normal conditions, but should also be versatile enough to be adaptable to other monitoring situations such as extremity-wrist, lens of eye, or area monitoring if required.  The system should possess a minimum reporting precision of 1 mrem with complete re-analysis capability to allow for dose measurement confirmation, it should incorporate a filtering mechanism that allows for differentiation between the various types and energies of radiation encountered, and it must be capable of qualitatively detecting and quantitatively measuring dose equivalents from low- and high-energy beta; low-, medium- and high-energy photon radiations; and neutrons in the thermal, intermediate, and fast ranges.  Accreditation must be in NVLAP categories I through VI as defined in ANSI/HPS N13.11 - 2001, Personnel Dosimetry Performance - Criteria for Testing.

A.  Minimum Reportable Doses:
(1) gamma, x ray -  1 mrem

D.	Analysis and quantification above 1000 rem must be available upon request.
E.	Sterilization: Dosimeters should be hermetically sealed and if possible, capable of being sterilized by gases such as ethylene oxide, or by solutions such as Betadine, Cidex, Wescodyne, or other similar means without compromising the integrity or capability of the monitor. 

Whole Body Monitor Option:  The contractor may substitute or offer another currently available dosimetry technology as an alternative to the OSL system, providing that the performance characteristics and the information available from the dosimeter provide comparable quantitative and qualitative data such as: static vs. dynamic exposure, shielded exposure, (i.e. an image of the exposure is available).

2.  Extremity Dosimeter:  Ring dosimeters shall be available as extremity monitors.  OSL is preferred, however, monitoring may also be accomplished via thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) extremity finger monitors.  Monitors shall be designed either as an adjustable ring or supplied in a minimum of three sizes (small, medium, and large).  Rings shall be designed with a label that bears all necessary identifying information in such a manner that it is impervious to fading/smearing due to moisture/washing.  TLD dosimeters shall be manufactured of Harshaw TLD-100 LiF ribbon or equivalent that is near tissue equivalency, possessing high sensitivity, a low fade rate, and extreme durability.  Accreditation must be in NVLAP extremity categories I through IV as defined in ANSI/HPS N13.32 - 1995, Performance Testing of Extremity Dosimeters.


A.	Minimum Reportable Doses:
(1) gamma, x ray - 30 mrem
(2) energetic beta - 40 mrem
B.   Minimum energy sensitivity:
(1) gamma, x ray - 10 keV
(2) energetic beta - 200 keV
C.	Minimum Detection Ranges:
(1) low and high energy gamma, x ray - 30 mrem to 1,000 rem
(2) beta over 1 MeV - 50 mrem to 1,000 rem
D.	Analysis and quantification above 1000 rem must be available upon request. 
E.	Ultraviolet Sensitivity: possible exposure to UV radiation shall be minimized or eliminated by the use of UV absorbing materials.
F.	Sterilization: Rings must be capable of being sterilized by gases such as ethylene oxide, or by solutions such as Betadine, Cidex, Wescodyne, or other similar products without compromising the integrity or capability of the monitor. 

Extremity Ring OSL Option: The contractor may substitute or offer another currently available extremity ring monitor technology as an alternative to the OSL, providing that the performance characteristics and information available from the dosimeter meets or exceeds that provided by the ring monitor described above.

3.  Environmental Dosimeter:  Environmental TLDs are deployed on a quarterly basis and shall be capable of a minimal detectable exposure of approximately 1 mrem.  The dosimeter shall consist of a minimum of two (2) tissue equivalent TLD elements in a single holder, with packaging that is weatherproof and suitable for deployment, as is, in the normal environment (rain, snow, sun, etc.) without the need for additional weather protection or housings.  The devices shall be provided with an easily deployable mounting device or container which is tamper resistant and can be easily fastened to signs, trees, lamp posts, etc., through the use of wire ties, clips, or other non-permanent fasteners.  The color should be black or some other non-vibrant/dull color, and the label containing required identifying information must be resistant to smearing and/or fading as a result of exposure to extreme or continued inclement weather.  Accreditation must be in accordance with ANSI N545.

A.	Error Limits:  Measurement error should not exceed 100% at the 95% confidence level for exposures below 10 mrem/quarter; and 30% at the 95% confidence level for exposures above 10 mrem/quarter.
B.	Filtration:  Filtration shall be such that at least one element is provided with at least 250 mg/cm2 of filtration.  
C.	Fade:  The dosimeter's fade characteristics shall be such that the dosimeter will not fade in excess of ten percent (10%) per quarter.
D.	The dosimeter must be accurate, durable, and measure to 1 mrem ambient dose equivalent:

Type of	Energy of	Dose Range		
Radiation	Radiation	 ( rem )  	Error Limit (%) 
  		X-ray, gamma	     .05 - 2 MeV           .001 - 10	(see text above)

Environmental TLD Option:  The contractor may substitute or offer as an alternative another available Environmental Dosimeter technology, provided that the performance characteristics and information available from the dosimeter meets or exceeds that listed above.

4.	Quantity:  The following required quantities will change over the life of this contract, with stated estimates reflecting current program requirements. Continuing program and regulatory review will dictate necessary changes in specific requirements for contract option years.  It is not anticipated that the total number of persons monitored will vary by more than + 25% each year.

     b. Should there by page limits on task order proposals?  If so, provide suggestions.
     c. Should options be allowed on task orders?  If so, what type of criteria should be used to determine which task orders may contain options and which may not (e.g. severable vs. non-severable work)?  How many options years should we allow on each task order?
     d. Determination of what constitutes a new task order requirement versus an in-scope task order modification or logical follow-on task order is a Contracting Officer decision.  Keeping in mind that a multiple award contract is a means to promote competition during the life of the contract, what type of criteria should the Government use as a baseline to make this determination?
6.  Do you have any suggestions on the Service Delivery Summary items and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan?

<DESC>This amendment is posted to provide the "Statement of Work" for the requirement; list a different point of contact for replies/questions, etc.; and to extend the response date for proposals for this requirement.
--------------------------------------------------
STATEMENT OF WORK- F73ADR43001100

1.  Provide the formal training at contractor’s location (training facility).  This training is off-the-shelf type, not dedicated training.  Current needs are MicroSoft courses to include but not limited to Developing ADO.NET Applications for SQL Server; Administering MS SQL Server 2000 Database; Implementing & Supporting MS WIN XP Pro; Managing MS WIN Server 2003 Environment; Programming w/ MS VB.NET; Intro to C# Programming w/ MS.NET; Implementing & Administering Security in a MS WIN 2003 Network; Developing ASP.NET Web Apps w Visual Studio; Programming w/ MS.NET Framework Visual C#; Programming w/ MS ADO.NET; Developing XML Web Services Using MS ASP.NET; MS Project Courses;  and Computing Technology Industry Association (Comp TIA) Courses to include A+ Certification Operating Systems; A+ Certification Hardware;  Security+ Certification Training
The courses named are current needs, but the customer reserves the right to substitute like courses offered by the contractor or delete courses if requirements change.  This “clause” is necessary due to the constant changing of Information Technology courses.  For instance, today a course could be offered called Supporting ABC Software, but six months from now ABC Software is replaced by DEF Software, customer would need the “updated” course.  The other possibility for substituting courses would be loss and gain of personnel during contract period; the new person may have need for different course.

2.  These proposed courses vary in course length (two to five-days), so the contractor will bid on a per-day price.  In other words, the contractor will price courses by category (line item) by day, for instance CISCO $525 per day, meaning any 5-day CISCO course would be $2,625 and any 3-day course would be $1575.  THE PRICES LISTED ARE USED AS EXAMPLES ONLY.  The customer would arrange for courses until all “days” were used.  Due to current and changing mission requirements, the number of students and number of different courses to be taken simultaneously cannot be determined.  In the past, contractors have offered schedules (open to public) for courses requested and customer arranged attendance as they could permit release of personnel.  No guarantee of participation in scheduled classes is made until customer makes such arrangements, but even then, customer reserves the right to cancel (even last minute) due to military necessity.  The customer wants to be able to send students to attend courses offered in the Montgomery area after providing the contractor with adequate advanced notice (two weeks).  Courses will have open enrollment, not solely dedicated to the customer.  NOTE:  If there are two separate MicroSoft line items, the separation is only due to different funding.  The courses identified are the same for both lines and all stipulations of the Statement of Work apply.

3.  Course Objectives:

a.	Receive training state-of-the-art training from certified instructors.  Most of these courses have an official curriculum from the “parent company” (i.e. MicroSoft, Cisco) that needs to be utilized.  
b.	Each of these off-the-shelf courses also have objectives outlined.  Customer expects to receive hands-on knowledge to better perform daily work related tasks.  Actual certification is not a goal, but if part of the course, it is expected.  If an additional charge is involved for certification, it would be the responsibility of each student. 

4.  Contractor is expected to provide all equipment, course materials, handouts, books and other related items as customary for each course.  Contractor is expected to provide a local facility (Montgomery area) for this training.  The cost o

<DESC>Change in Scope of work:The two large pine tree’s in the southern-most end of Marshall(adjacent the main gate) are to remain and are not to be removed.

Answer to two questions posted during 19 Jan 05 site visit.

Question 1.  Though the SOW mentioned using chainsaws as the main means of removing / trimming the trees, can the Contractor use a tracked vehicle to shove the dropped trees back into the woods?

 Answer: A tracked vehicle can be utilized as long as the ground is not wet and the ground is not disturbed (the operator will need to exercise caution when turning).  Also, if there is not ample clear space behind the new tree line to receive the downed tree, the tree may have to be de-limbed and then placed behind the new tree line - the Contractor will not be allowed to shove the larger trees into brush piles lining the new tree line or damage the remaining trees behind that new tree line.

Question 2. Can the Contractor utilize a shearing machine (forestry mower) to remove the vegetation?  If so, does the machine have to have rubber tires or can it be on tracks?

Answer: A shearing device (i.e. forestry mower) to cut the trees / undergrowth is an acceptable method for removal.   Whether the vehicle utilizes tracks or rubber tires, the ground must not be disturbed (the operator will need to exercise caution when turning).

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. Closing date for all bids is still no later than 1500 hours 2 Feb 2005.

2  		DELIVERY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  
 
2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT (3-5 PAGES)

Prior to departure to the host countries, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on viability of the project(s), financing options, U.S. company interest in the project(s), a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

 
2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host countries of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial/Economic Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to both host countries (The Gambia and Mali) to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassies.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial/Economic Section at each U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassies may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report.  Although not required, French language skills are preferred for travel to Mali.  If Contractor does not possess French language skills, the Contractor should appropriately budget for as-needed interpretation services.

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.1		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.1.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.1.2		 assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.1.3	          provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues

2.6.2		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must:

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

USTDA seeks to hire a definitional mission team to review energy and power sector opportunities for possible USTDA assistance in The Gambia and Mali.  The definitional mission will analyze both direct requests made to USTDA for funding assistance and opportunities that may be discovered during the informational gathering stage of the definitional mission.  USTDA assistance could open new opportunities for U.S. firms and support the development priorities for this important sector in these countries.  The DM team will be expected to travel to the region in early spring of 2005.  The U.S. Embassies in each country are very supportive of this USTDA definitional mission.  

The Gambia

A state-owned enterprise, the National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC) retains complete control of power generation, distribution, and transmission in The Gambia.  The sole power generation facility in the country is Kotu Power Plant, which is fueled with heavy fuel oil.  Kotu is an aged facility in need of upgrading and modernization and rarely operates at full capacity.  As a result of inefficient production, NAWEC routinely schedules black-out periods for areas in which it supplies electricity.  In addition, distribution centers and transmission lines throughout the country are in disrepair and in need of upgrading.

The Government of The Gambia (GOTG) intends to privatize NAWEC and has been in discussions with possible foreign investors to take ownership of the utility.  

The definitional mission will investigate possible roles for USTDA’s assistance in the overall energy and power sector in The Gambia.  Potential activities could include the privatization efforts of NAWEC by the GOTG, upgrading and expanding of Kotu power plant, increasing efficiency of distribution centers, and strengthening the transmission line network in the country.  During recent meetings held in Banjul between USTDA and the GOTG, the GOTG requested USTDA specifically consider providing regulatory/legal technical assistance for privatization efforts concerning NAWEC.

Mali

In 2000, the Government of Mali privatized the state-owned electricity company, Energie du Mali (EDM).  EDM is currently owned by a French-Pakistani consortium. EDM operates hydroelectric power generation stations in Selingue and Sotuba and a thermal powered power plant in Darsalam.  The three are the only plants connected to the national grid, representing installed capacity of 52% hydro and 48% thermal.  Plans are underway to expand capacity at all three stations.  Whereas EDM is meeting current demand for areas covered by the national grid, there is no excess production capability to meet expected future demand.  Additionally, much of the county’s territory remains unconnected to the national grid system.  

During a recent USTDA visit to Mali, the Ministry of Mines, Energy, and Water requested USTDA consider providing assistance to help Mali develop rural access to electrification.  The DM consultant will investigate this potential activity as well as other potential activities in the Mali’s energy sector.  The DM consultant will meet with both EDM and the Ministry to discuss potential activities.  

 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity.

6. 		 Project Descriptions and Profile

Pakistan’s transport sector is inefficient.  To rectify this problem, the Pakistani Government and the World Bank are considering critical transportation modernization and expansion projects.  The DM consultant would examine four sets of projects recently proposed for USTDA consideration:

1.	Regional rail corridor infrastructure – Pakistan Railways (PR) has requested USTDA assistance with studies on modernization and expansion of rail lines connecting Afghanistan, India and Central Asia with Pakistan and its rail and port infrastructure.  In particular, the DM will consider PR requests for assistance with the following rail lines:
·	Kandhar-Herat-Kushka – to extend the rail network to Afghanistan and Turkmenistan;
·	Gawadar-Nushki -- to handle Central Asian rail freight; and
·	Kasur-Pakpattan-Lodhran -- to improve traffic with India.  
·	Complementary intermodal facilities to handle rail, truck and maritime cargo along the rail network and at strategic points along Pakistan’s existing logistics infrastructure.
PR’s Director General has requested assistance with these projects.

2.	With Pakistan committed to improving its container scanner capabilities and cargo handling procedures, the American Embassy advises that Pakistani transport sector stakeholders could benefit from U.S. technical assistance with transportation security. 

3.	Two years ago, a DM team proposed USTDA consideration of feasibility study support for the $200 million rehabilitation of Karachi’s light rail network.  USTDA postponed support for this recommendation because of unresolved issues related to grantee support.  Given recent statements by the Prime Minister prioritizing this project, this no longer appears to be an issue.

4.	Two years ago, a DM team proposed USTDA consideration of a feasibility study for the Islamabad International Airport.  USTDA postponed support for this recommendation because of unresolved issues related to grantee support.  The project should be reconsidered at this time based upon recent conversations with the Pakistani officials.

<DESC>PLEASE SEE AMENDMENT 1 FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK FOR THIS DEFINITIONAL MISSION (SECTIONS 1 – 3)


4		Industry Report (An Expanded, More Intensive Research on U.S. Competitiveness and Foreign Competition)

4.1		Objective

		To provide an assessment of the ability of U.S. entities to compete with foreign sources of supply on airport expansion and modernization projects, as well as an assessment of any recent trends in the industry. This Industry Report should concentrate on the most important types of equipment, technologies and services required for such projects, and address current U.S. abilities to meet these requirements. Among the questions to be asked are: (1) Does the U.S. have current capability to produce or supply such items? (2) What is the recent experience of U.S. entities in winning contracts in these categories? (3) Are there any institutional impediments (e.g., restrictions or biases against sourcing some markets from the U.S.)? (4) What does recent history suggest about the realistic ability of U.S. entities to successfully obtain competitive financing on such projects? (5) Other questions that impact on U.S. companies’ ability to supply equipment, technologies or services to such projects. Offerors are invited to discuss other aspects of the issue.

4.2		Information Sources

		Information about U.S. sources of supply and competitiveness with foreign sources should be drawn from a wide array of information sources to include: (1) Case Studies of five USTDA activities (see attached list for an indication of the kinds of activity USTDA has funded in this sector) and five non-USTDA activities (to be jointly selected by USTDA and the Contractor); and (2) Interviews with relevant contacts in the industry. USTDA believes that a minimum of 40 interviews should be undertaken. Examples of sources of information include equipment suppliers, engineering firms, financial organizations (e.g. U.S. ExIm Bank, World Bank etc.), U.S. Government experts (e.g., FAA), industry specialists and host country project sponsors. The perspectives of Russian and Ukrainian officials will be sought in the course of producing the traditional Definitional Mission Report (i.e., travel to the country); and (3) Recent international trade statistics of exports and imports of relevant equipment.  

4.3		Involvement of USTDA Evaluations Office

		Analysts from USTDA’s evaluations team will participate in the intensive sector research aspects of this DM. USTDA activities will be coordinated with the Contractor, and the results of USTDA’s information-gathering will be provided to the Contractor for inclusion in the assessment. Specifically, USTDA analysts will provide expertise and access to U.S. and other foreign trade statistics databases. Information on relevant goods will be compiled and analyzed by USTDA and will be made available to the Contractor. USTDA’s evaluations office will also undertake up to 15 of the 40 interviews with U.S. company officials and other industry specialists. These efforts will be closely coordinated with those of the Contractor. Finally, the evaluations office will be available to the Contractor for any relevant information on USTDA’s own activities in this field.

4.4		Final Report Objectives

		Final Report - Contractor will prepare a final report summarizing the information gathered during the research. The purpose of the final report is to provide an assessment of the competitiveness of U.S. entities vis-à-vis foreign companies in winning business on airport rehabilitation and modernization projects.

The report shall contain the following items:

·	An assessment of current U.S. manufacturing capabilities in critical areas of this industry (Note- this is not intended to be a comprehensive and detailed listing of all U.S. production capabilities, but rather an assessment of current U.S. capability to produce the key elements).

·	A discussion of institutional impediments- Factors that would prevent or hinder U.S. capabilities from use on foreign projects (e.g., would a multinational company be likely to source from the U.S. on a project in Africa if it had manufacturing facilities in Europe?).

An analysis of empirical information – include a discussion of conclusions that can be drawn from the interviews, case studies and trade statistics.

·	Competitiveness by category of export and by world region. Categorize U.S. competitiveness (strong/moderately strong/weak) for different categories of goods, services and technologies as well as for different parts of the world.

Other Objectives- Comment on whether USTDA projects appear to be successful along other indicia of importance to USTDA. These include, but are not limited to, host country economic development, international aviation security, indirect benefits for U.S. air carriers, and U.S. foreign policy goals.

7 		Project Descriptions and Profile

USTDA intends to hire a DM Contractor to examine several potential projects in the aviation sector in Russia and Ukraine and also to produce a focused industry report (“Industry Report”) on U.S. export success in airport rehabilitation projects in developing countries over the last five years. The DM Contractor will prepare two final reports as defined above: a Definitional Mission Report and an Industry Report.

The aviation industries of Russia and Ukraine are currently unable to meet air transportation demand for several reasons, all resulting from underinvestment in the infrastructure since the fall of the Soviet Union. Most airports are in need of major upgrades to meet modern standards for international and domestic services, ranging from air traffic control systems to passenger services. Likewise, much of the aircraft that service regional transport are technologically obsolete, with the result that airlines are steadily acquiring, or planning to acquire Western aircraft, even against the backdrop of extremely high import duties. Unmet demand will cause an increase in the price of transportation, which will eventually create a needed revenue stream for airlines and airports.

In August, USTDA met with management from Kyiv-Boryspil Airport. Boryspil, the main Ukrainian international airport, services over 50% of the country’s commercial air traffic, including 75% of international flights to and from Ukraine. The Government of Ukraine (GOU) hopes to turn Boryspil airport into a Central and Eastern European hub for major international connections. Boryspil has several large projects underway, including the upgrade and overhaul of the existing international terminal. In Russia, Krasnoyarsk Airlines (KrasAir) has requested assistance in developing a study to address its airport modernization/expansion requirements as well as their fleet replacement needs. KrasAir, which is both an airline and an airport, comprises Russia’s third largest airline in terms of passenger-kilometers flown and has several large investment plans, including airport upgrade/expansion, fleet modernization and regional hub development. The DM will analyze potential opportunities in each of these modernization projects. USTDA assistance could open new opportunities for U.S. firms and support the development priorities of this important sector in both Russia and Ukraine.

This DM will also produce an Industry Report on U.S. export success in airport rehabilitation projects. The selected DM Contractor will research ten such projects (5 USTDA projects, 5 non-USTDA projects) in developing countries over the last five years, to provide USTDA with examples of U.S. success stories and detailed information on project procurement and sourcing of U.S. goods and services. The USTDA Evaluations team has been working with regional staff to define this scope and would be involved in this aspect of the DM. The Evaluations team would be available for consultation and would work with the DM Contractor and regional team to select the five USTDA case studies. In coordination with the DM Contractor, the Evaluations team would interview up to 15 U.S. companies that are active in the business, along with relevant trade associations and USG entities.

<DESC>WORK STATEMENT

“Expanded Definitional Mission” for Advisory and Assistance Services by Non-Governmental Sources.

Project Title:  Europe & Eurasia Regional: Expanded Definitional Mission (DM) on the Aviation Sector 

1		Scope of Work

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide two reports to USTDA.

The first report will be the “Definitional Mission Report,” which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed feasibility studies or other activities; 

1.3		assess any alternative studies or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4		provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues, as called for in Sections 2 and 3 below.

The second report will be the “Industry Report,” as described briefly below and in more detail in Section 4.

1.5		For this DM, USTDA wants to undertake a more intensive research effort than is normally undertaken for USTDA DMs on the role that U.S. entities have played and are likely to play in implementing the prospective project. For this reason, we have expanded the scope of work and the budget for this DM to include research and a separate report on U.S. Industrial Competitiveness and Foreign Competition (see in particular the new Section 4).

2  		Delivery & Performance Requirements

2.1		Kick-Off Meeting with the USTDA Program Office

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) (see G.2) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		Pre-Visit Report

Prior to departure to the host countries, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  At the time of the pre-visit report, the Contractor will also provide a preliminary outline of the expected activities (and brief summary of any research activities that have already begun at that time) to be undertaken in connection with the research on U.S. Industrial Competitiveness and Foreign Competition (see Section 4).  At that time, work is expected to have begun on several key aspects of this research:  identification of the USTDA and non-USTDA case studies; identification of the most important potential categories of U.S. exports of goods and services; preliminary research (to be done by USTDA) on recent U.S. exports of these categories; and initial interviews with U.S. industry.

2.3		USTDA Responsibility

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host countries of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Economic and Commercial Sections of the respective Embassies provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		Contractor’s Host Country Travel 

The Contractor shall travel to various locations within Ukraine and Russia to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassies.    The Contractor shall contact the Economic and Commercial Sections at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassies may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services.  In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		Contractor Meaningful Discussions

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA Report Objectives

		Background - For this project, USTDA is requiring the Contractor to conduct a more intensive investigation of U.S. industrial competitiveness and foreign competition than is normally done in USTDA DMs. Research for this part of the project should be carried out in conjunction with the traditional DM work. The reason for conducting both kinds of research more or less simultaneously is the fact that USTDA believes that information gained from the traditional, project-oriented DM research can be useful in reaching conclusions about U.S. industrial competitiveness and vice versa. Nevertheless, while the research for the two objectives should be closely coordinated, USTDA is requiring two separate reports. First, a standard report (the “Definitional Mission” report) must be written to assess the prospective projects according to USTDA’s usual criteria. Naturally, USTDA expects that some of the information from the more intensive investigation of U.S. and Foreign Industrial Competitiveness will inform the DM conclusions.  The Contractor will also provide a second, separate report (the “Industry Report”), which will assess the general competitiveness of U.S. industry in this sector utilizing a broader source of information. Just as information from the intensive survey is expected to be used to draw conclusions for the DM report, USTDA expects the Contractor to utilize information gathered for the traditional DM report to inform and check the conclusions of the broader study.  

The rest of Section 2.6 and Section 3 detail USTDA’s objectives for the traditional Definitional Mission Report. Section 4 below details USTDA’s objectives and expectations for the more intensive industry investigation (“Industry Report”), including USTDA’s preliminary requirements, the scope of work for the research and a description of the work that USTDA’s evaluations office will contribute in support of Contractor efforts.  (Note- Offerors are encouraged to suggest new or modified research objectives, sources of information and methodologies).

2.6.0		Definitional Mission Report Objectives

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.1		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.1.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.1.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.1.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections 3.1 through 3.15.

2.6.2		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.2.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.2.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.2.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.2.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing strong competition from foreign companies receiving subsidies and other support from their governments.

The Contractor shall submit a review of the financing options for project implementation, including an assessment of the overall cost estimate of the project and, for projects involving potential U.S. equity investment, the project’s proposed debt-equity structure to ensure that it corresponds to the requirements of the prospective lenders (this aspect is critical to USTDA’s decision making).  As part of this review, the Contractor is required to contact officials from the potential financing institutions, including, where appropriate, multilateral lending institutions, Ex-Im Bank, OPIC, and private/commercial sources, to assure that the project sponsors have adequately explored their financing options.  The Contractor shall provide names and phone numbers of contacts at the potential lending institutions and summarize their comments.  The Contractor must determine the most likely source(s) of implementation financing and ensure that the terms of reference for any proposed feasibility study fulfill the requirements of the most likely source(s).  

3.6		U.S. Export Potential (1-2 Pages)

The Contractor shall submit a best estimate of potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation.  This estimate should be supported by a breakdown by category and dollar value of goods and services likely to be imported for the project and an illustrative list of potential U.S. suppliers of the goods and services for those goods and services listed as likely U.S. exports.  A report of discussions with a reasonable number of U.S. companies that could be exporters, and their level of interest in the project, should also be included.

3.7		U.S. Industrial Competitiveness and Foreign Competition (1-2 Pages)

The Contractor shall discuss the foreign competition for goods and services likely to be procured for project implementation by category, including a discussion of U.S. industry competitiveness in each category, taking into account geographic factors, local industry capabilities, technology and licensee issues, past procurement tendencies of the project sponsor, and how the procurement is likely to be conducted.  This section will draw upon the more intensive research gathered for the Industry Report.
