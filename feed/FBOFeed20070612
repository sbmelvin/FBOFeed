<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 07-40 Technologies for Persistent Operations in High LAtitude Regions (POLAR); 

CLOSING DATE: Two years from the date of publication in www.fbo.gov and/or www.grants.gov; POC: Dr. Brian M. Pierce, DARPA/STO; Email: BAA07-40@darpa.mil; Website: http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicitations/BAA07-40/index.html.  This BAA plus the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) constitute the full BAA and proposers must obtain and follow the details of submission set forth in the PIP.


INTRODUCTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals under this BAA 07-40 to pursue research, development, design, and testing that will lead to the advancement of technologies for Persistent Operations in High LAtitude Regions (POLAR). The objective is to enhance U.S. military capabilities in the Polar Regions.

DARPA is interested in new high-risk/high-payoff technologies and operating concepts that would give U.S. military forces revolutionary capabilities that address operational challenges specific to polar environments.  DARPA is not interested in incremental approaches, but seeks highly innovative technical approaches and operational perspectives, approaches that exploit novel technologies, and new operational concepts.


TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS

Research supporting the broad mission objective identified in the Introduction above may be submitted under this BAA.  Topic areas of specific interest include, but are not limited to, the following. 
1. System Architectures and Integration: This area seeks novel integrated Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) specifically tailored for the polar environment, which increase the duration and speed of operations by U.S. military forces.  The goal is to create system level approaches by providing technical and operational options enabling the planning and execution of more persistent polar operations. Solutions may apply to a wide range of military operations. Of particular interest are solutions that address the very different challenges presented by operations in the polar environment.  Proposers should explain what tools are used to plan and provide intelligence, as well as discuss the size of the force and its make up, including: personnel, weapons, logistics support, combat equipment, etc.
2. Communications, Command, Control, and Intelligence (C3I) Systems: This area seeks new approaches to collaborative and all-echelon C3I needed to support polar operations in the space, air, land, sea-surface, and undersea domains. C3I links within and between these domains are challenged by the maritime, atmospheric, ionospheric, and magnetospheric conditions unique to the polar environment. Furthermore, satellites in high inclination orbits are more important to C3I in the Polar Regions than satellites in geosynchronous orbits.  The C3I systems need to integrate unmanned capabilities with manned systems.  Where practical, the new systems of interest to this area should integrate with current C3I systems.
3. Persistent Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) Systems: This area seeks advances in RSTA systems needed to support polar operations in the space, air, land, sea-surface, and undersea domains. Similar to C3I, RSTA within and between these domains is challenged by the maritime, atmospheric, ionospheric, and magnetospheric conditions unique to the polar environment.  The RSTA systems need to integrate unmanned capabilities with manned systems.  Information processing technologies supporting and enhancing RSTA systems for operations in the polar environment are also of interest. Proposed approaches should have high confidence and low latency to support C3I.
4. Navigation: High latitude operations are challenging as traditional fix sources degrade; are out of range or not available; or require alternative computational methods to recover an accurate fix.  For example, the use of inertial navigation systems for operations under ice becomes problematic as errors accumulate.  This area seeks to develop technologies that significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of polar navigation in all environmental conditions.
5. Weapons Systems: This area seeks advances in weapons systems needed to support polar operations in the air, land, sea-surface, and undersea domains. For example, the 'zero-ceiling' and 'zero-visibility' weather often seen in the Polar Regions can challenge weapon guidance systems.
6. Access and Mobility: This area seeks technologies that enhance polar access and mobility in the air, land, sea-surface, and undersea domains.  Regional weather increases the likelihood of icing. Approaches that reduce ice buildup and/or remove ice on aircraft, ships and vehicles are highly desired. Of interest are novel approaches that facilitate rapid mobility of vessels in ice-covered waters. Vertical lift is critical to polar operations, and of interest are systems that can operate for extended periods in the polar environment. Approaches that will overcome the challenges of ice, snow and permafrost to land mobility are of interest.  Manned and unmanned vehicles (aerial, aquatic, terrestrial) that enable access and mobility with machine-enhanced navigational aids or autonomic guidance are desired in general.
7. Logistics and Support: This area seeks to develop technologies that would significantly reduce overhead required to support U.S. military forces for polar operations. This includes both on-demand delivery as well as portable technologies that significantly reduce the logistics burden of operational necessities (food, water, power, medical, etc.). For example, an average person's caloric requirement just to stay warm at high latitudes is on the order of 5,000 calories/day, which is significantly more than that at temperate latitudes.  Technologies maintaining personnel performance in the air, land and sea during extended periods of exposure to cold, wind chill, and darkness/light typical of the polar environment are of interest.  Polar operations will challenge the replenishment of ships that is usually performed underway at lower latitudes.
8. Measurement and Modeling: This area seeks to provide an understanding of how high latitude, snow, ice, permafrost, and weather will challenge emerging sensing, communication, and navigation systems important to the U.S. military. Interest includes understanding how systems using electromagnetic (e.g., RF, IR, EO), acoustic, inertial navigation, and other phenomena will perform in polar environments for all operations. 

APPROACH

The Government encourages responders to this BAA to submit executive summaries, and receive the Government's feedback thereto, prior to preparing and submitting proposal abstracts or full proposals.  The purpose of this is to spare responders the burden of preparing abstracts or full proposals that are unlikely to result in an award under this BAA. The required formats for all three submittals (executive summary, proposal abstract, and full proposal) are provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) associated with this BAA.   For all responses to this BAA, the responder must clearly identify the technical topic area(s) the proposed effort seeks to address.

Responders to this BAA may suggest the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Procurement Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or other such appropriate award instrument.  The Government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offer the best overall value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to award without discussion. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA. The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.     The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.


PROPOSERS

The Government encourages responses from non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories. Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU/MI, small or small disadvantaged business participation due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought. Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per P.L. 103-337 Section 217 and P.L 105-261 Section 3136.     Any responsible and otherwise qualified Proposer is encouraged to respond.     

Responders may be foreign firms or may team with foreign firms as long as the firm meets the criteria in this BAA and the Government is otherwise permitted to conduct business with the firm, however, only unclassified proposals will be considered from foreign sources, or where any proposed teaming arrangement involves a foreign source. Proposers may include foreign personnel as part of their proposed resources as long as these personnel qualify technically, the proposed effort is unclassified, and such foreign personnel sign any and all appropriate non-disclosure agreements prior to participating in the research effort.


PROGRAM SCOPE AND FUNDING	

The Government anticipates multiple comprehensive awards under this BAA.  The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.

<DESC>Notice of Intent In March 1999, contract number DE-AC02-99CH10888 was competitively awarded  to  Duke, Cogema, Stone & Webster, LLC, now known as Shaw AREVA MOX Services,  LLC,  for design, construction and operation of the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication  Facility (MOX) and Reactor Irradiation Services.  The design of the  facility is  based on commercial facilities in France.  The MOX facility provides a  mechanism for the disposition of U.S. owned excess weapons-plutonium in  accordance with national security requirements.  The contract contains an  option (Option 1) for the actual construction of the main MOX facility and  all  support facilities; cold start-up of the MOX facility; continued support  of NRC  licensing activities associated with the MOX facility and mission  reactors,  mission reactor modification; and procurement of fresh MOX fuel assembly  shipping packages.  This announcement provides notification of the National Nuclear Security  Administrations intent to exercise Option 1 to support the planned start  of  construction on August 1, 2007.  The estimated value of the Option 1 work  is in  excess of $2.5 billion.  Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1),  the  Department has determined that only one responsible source can satisfy the  agency requirements.  These activities are for the continued development  and  construction of a major system involving highly specialized equipment  (some of  which is proprietary technology).  It is likely that award to any other  source  would result in substantial duplication of costs that are not expected to  be  recovered through competition, as well as, unacceptable schedule delays in  fulfilling the agencys requirements.  Companies having questions or comments about this action should contact  Carol  Elliott at 803-208-3345 or by e-mail at carol.elliott@nnsa.srs.gov no  later  than 15 days after publication of this notice.

Each delivery system consists of Radius 1040 Internal-umbilical Chair with seamless upholstery, air/water quick disconnect in chair lift assy., Radius 2122 Traditional Delivery System, Position #1 - Autoclavable syringe 23.1150F00, Position #2 - 4-hole tubing 98.0879F00, Position #3 - Fiber optic with bulb tubing 98.0262F00, Position #4 - No tubing, intra-oral light source, dual voltage for 2 handpieces 90.0382F00, Chair touch pad, programmable 39.1045F00, Wet/Dry foot control with chip blower button, 300-watt power supply 28.1435F00,  Cascade contoured floor box frame and cover 41.1457F01, Radius 7155 Assistant?s Instrumentation w/3 position holder 75.1417F00, and 6300 radius Light 28.1303.00.  

IV.	AUTHORITY:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) & 6.302-1(c). 

V.	APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  Request to compete this Brand Name requirement. The 4th MDG is phasing out old dental systems currently in place.  This Brand Name Requirement is necessary to maintain standardization of existing equipment already in place.  A-DEC is the only known dental equipment configuration which will fit in the constructed chair site and is recommended by 4 ADOS/SGGD.      Additionally, 4 ADOS/SGGD has purchased only ADEC Systems since January 2006; the unit has already spent $67,000 in A-DEC Dental Chair Systems.  Biomedical Repair personnel are currently trained on A-DEC dental chair systems and the 4th MDG will not require additional training in the amount of approximately $10,000.00 for 120 training hours.  The Aeromedical Dental facility has been constructed to utilize smaller size dental chair systems and a drastic remodel would be required to accommodate to other dental chair systems.  Additionally, facility modifications would need to be accomplished to accommodate a different brand dental chair system.  Award of any brand name other than A-DEC Inc. will not be cost effective and would result in substantial duplication of costs since personnel are currently trained on A-DEC dental chair systems.  The duplication of costs is not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.

VI.	EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  A notice of the Government?s intent to award a Brand Name contract will be publicized via the Federal Business Opportunities Website as required by FAR 5.2.  

VII.	FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  The anticipated cost has been determined fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii) & (vi).        

VIII.	MARKET SURVEY:  A-DEC, Inc. has two (2) authorized distributors located in North Carolina, Benco Dental Supply Company and Patterson Dental Supply Inc., which are approved to sell A-DEC?s entire line of dental chair systems, parts, and accessories.  Other than the authorized distributors, A-DEC does not allow any other companies to sell their products without prior approval.  

IX.	OTHER FACTS:  Without the A-DEC dental chair systems, active duty and reserve personnel assigned to Seymour Johnson AFB will be turned away due to the lack of dental chair systems and would not be world-wide deployable or able to complete mission requirements.   

X.	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION:  The using activity has certified that the technical requirements and certifications are complete and accurate.

XI.	CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION:  The Contracting Officer?s signature on the Justification Review Document represents certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) The Department of the Air Force, Electronic Systems Center, 551 ELSG/PK at Hanscom AFB, MA 01731 intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Northrop Grumman Navigation Systems Division, Litton Guidance and Control Systems Division, Woodland Hills, CA 91637 to produce approximately fourteen (14) new Embedded GPS Inertials (EGIs) and modify and upgrade the E-3 inventory (currently at 102 units) to the Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) configuration. This effort will have a three year period of performance if options are exercised. A Sources Sought Synopsis was published to FedBizzOpps on 02 October 2006 under the title of "Navigation Warfare Production". The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Northrop Grumman Navigation Systems Division under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) entitled "One Responsible Source And No Other Supplies Or Services Will Satisfy Agency  Requirements". Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304-(c)1.  The Government has determined that an award to any source other than Northrop Grumman Navigation Systems Division would result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Additionally, this notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Please direct questions to Edna Alonis, Contracting Officer, (781) 377-5747, EMAIL: Edna.Alonis@hanscom.af.mil.  See Note 26.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a firm-fixed price supply contract with Aeroflex Cupertino, 10411 Bubb Road, Cupertino CA 95014 for signal generator hardware and software.   A commercial solicitation will be issued using other than full and open competition to Aeroflex Cupertino IAW FAR 6.302 and the procedures at FAR 13.5.  Delivery will be FOB Origin, NSWC-Crane, Crane, Indiana 47522-5000, within 4 months ARO.   The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Aeroflex Cupertino, under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary information of Aeroflex Cupertino, form, fit, and function compatibility and the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Governments requirements.   Interested parties may respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The POC is Ms. Julie D. Wittmer, Code 0563WJ, at telephone 812-854-3847, or email: julie.wittmer@navy.mil.

<ARCHDATE>06112008
<CONTACT>Dale Wilkerson Contracting Officer 6626804009     dale_wilkerson@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service is seeking a contractor to remove and treat Chinese privet within three units of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area in Atlanta, Georgia, along the Chattahoochee River.  Chinese Privet (Ligustrum sinense) reduces biodiversity, displaces native plants, alters landscapes, and threatens the ecological integrity of the park. Chinese privet has an affinity for floodplains and inhabits at varying levels of density approximately 750 acres within the park. The purpose of this project is to remove and treat a total of 80 acres of Chinese privet within approximately 200 acres of park land.  The work shall commence on December 1, 2007 and be concluded no later than February 29, 2008.  Work during these months will minimize the incidental killing of native plants, since Chinese privet retains its green foliage while most other native plants have lost their leaves. The contractor will be required to remove privet by either hand cutting or by pulling the plant and roots. When this is not practical, the work may be performed with gasoline powered brush cutters and chainsaws. Any other method of mechanical treatment requires prior approval of the Contracting Officer.  Debris generated by this project will either be properly disposed of off of park lands or chipped and spread on-site.  The estimated magnitude of this project is $150,000 to $200,000.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside being conducted as a Request for Proposals, utilizing the Lowest Cost/Technically Acceptable method outlined in FAR 15.101-2.  The applicable NAICS code is 115310 with an associated size standard of $6.5 million.  This notice is not the solicitation.  The solicitation package will be available on or about June 27, 2007 and will be issued as an RFP electronically on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available.  The Standard Form 33 is available at the website by clicking on the "printer friendly form" link.

This procurement is for two additional pieces of cold flow test articles to support the J2X nozzle side load cold flow testing in MSFCs Nozzle Test Facility (NTF).  These two test articles are minor modifications of hardware previously designed and fabricated and delivered by KT Engineering.  This hardware is currently in test in the NTF.  The effort and cost required to alter the existing designs to create the two additional pieces of hardware are small relative to that already invested in the exiting test articles. Because of KT Engineerings experience designing and fabricating the existing hardware, sole sourcing this effort will result in significant savings of funds and time to the Government.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 6/21/2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Zaid El-Kilani, Assistant Secretary General of for Sewerage Affairs, Water Authority of Jordan, P.O. Box 2412, Amman 11183, Jordan, Phone: +(962) 6 568 3100, Fax: +(962) 6 568 6449, Zaid_Kilani@mwi.gov.jo.  Feasibility Study:  Wastewater Treatment Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on the construction of a wastewater treatment plant to serve the towns west of Salt City in the Balqa?a governorate of Jordan.  

Jordan is one of the ten most water-deprived countries in the world, with less than 200 cubic meters of fresh water available to the average Jordanian. Water consumption well exceeds the renewable supply, and lack of water will be one of the most serious constraints to Jordan?s economic growth.  

Currently, there is no existing wastewater collection system to serve the communities west of Salt City in the Balqa?a governorate of Jordan (project area).  The population relies on cesspits and septic tanks to dispose of their wastewater.  These usually located in the garden or the backyard, but sometimes under the house itself or very close to the main road.  Seepage from septic tanks has been observed in these areas, which constitutes major health risks and environmental pollution in the midst of populated areas.  Furthermore, the raw sewerage pumped from cesspits and septic tanks is transported to one of three nearby wastewater treatment plants:  Balqa'a, Salt, and Fuheis.

In addition to serving and improving sanitation conditions in these towns, the construction of a wastewater treatment plant to serve the project area would also help reduce some of the loading on the existing wastewater treatment plants in the region.  The objectives of the project are to provide the towns in the project area with a comprehensive wastewater system, to raise the sanitary and health standards of the communities, and to alleviate the pollution problems of the groundwater caused by the existing sanitation systems.  The feasibility study would analyze wastewater collection, treatment and effluent reuse from a number of communities in the project area in order to determine the most appropriate technical solution for a wastewater collection and treatment system to serve the needs of the connected towns to the year 2028.

The Grantee is the Jordanian Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, acting through the Water Authority of Jordan. 

The Tasks to be completed as a part of the study are as follows:

Task 1:  Kick-off Meeting and Review of Relevant Reports and Data
Task 2:  Review of the Existing Wastewater Treatment Systems
Task 3:  Selection of Alternatives and Priorities   
Task 4:  Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment
Task 5:  Preliminary Engineering Design
Task 6:  Project Cost Estimates
Task 7:  Economic, Financial and Socio economic Analysis of the Project
Task 8:  Development Impact Assessment
Task 9:  Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $450,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 9:00am Local Time, on  July 20, 2007 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to place a cost plus fixed fee order under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement, N00019-05-G-0026 with McDonnell Douglas Corporation ( A Wholly Owned  Subsidiary of the Boeing Company, P.O Box 516 St. Louis Missouri 63166) for the procurement of a Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) for the F/A-18E/F series of aircraft on a sole source basis.  

The SLAP effort provides an assessment of fatigue life against SLAP goals for structure affected by flight for maneuver, catapults, arrestments and landings, etc. based on actual Fleet usage.  The USN has defined a need to fly the F/A-18E/F beyond the original 6000 hour service life.  A significant portion of the airframe is believed to have additional inherent capability and a life extension may be possible for many portions of the airframe.  The service life may also be extended where needed by performing inspections or retrofit/replacement of parts. 

The activities will be conducted at various off-site detachments.  McDonnell Douglas is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and integrator of the F/A-18 aircraft in its various configurations and is the only known source with the expertise, resources, intricate knowledge and data for the aircraft and its systems necessary to accomplish this effort. 

Any interested party must have the approved facility(ies) and personnel clearances necessary and also demonstrate its ability to obtain any required clearances in time to meet the schedule requirements. 

Any respondent must also submit a Statement of Qualifications to demonstrate its ability to perform to the Government's needs within the required response time.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only. See Note 22.

17.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a Task Order on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide services and products in the areas of V-22 Avionics Systems and Software Engineering (AS2E) and V-22 Software Support Activity (SSA).  This effort requires intricate knowledge of avionics systems and software used by the V-22 platform, which is poised for three key program milestones - Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for MV-22 occurring in FY08, Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for CV-22, also occurring in FY08, and CV-22 IOC in FY09.  Additionally, the SSA will be issuing a software suite release to the MV-22 and CV-22 fleet in FY-09.  RTSC is the only known source independent of the V-22 prime contractor that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting schedule and cost constraints of the program: 

(A) V-22 Avionics Systems and Software Engineering.  RTSC will continue to provide avionics development systems engineering for the MV-22 block C and CV-22 Block 20 developments.  RTSC avionics system engineers provide independent assessment of the V-22 prime contractor?s avionics development, integration and test for MV-22 Block C and CV-22 Block 20.  RTSC systems engineers review and generate Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) that affect V-22 avionics.  RTSC will continue to provide avionics development systems engineering, Configuration Management (CM), Data Management (DM), and logistics engineering for Full Authority Digital Engine Controller (FADEC), engine and aircraft health monitoring systems (Vibration, Structural Life, and Engine Diagnostics (VSLED)), Drive System Interface Unit (DSIU), Ice Protection System (IPS), Wing Fire Protection Controller (WFPC), Fuel Management System (FMS), Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), Dual Digital Map System (DMS), Display Electronics Unit (DEU), Control Display Unit (CDU)/Engine Instrument Crew Alerting System (EICAS), Advanced Mission Computer (AMC), Night Vision Goggle (NVG)/Heads Up Display (HUD), Communication Switching Unit (CSU), Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), Directed Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM), Suite of Integrated Radio Frequency Countermeasures (SIRFC), Terrain Avoidance Warning System (TAWS), Flight Director and Coupled Modes (FDCM) and a Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) for low altitude "nap of the earth" flying. RTSC engineers also provide extensive inputs into avionics development, integration, and production by working on V-22 avionics Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) with the V-22 prime contractor (Bell-Boeing), avionics suppliers, and the government.  RTSC is the government's designated representative to perform Formal Qualification Testing (FQT) of the V-22 Operational Flight Program (OFP), JVX Application System Software (JASS).   

(B) V-22 Software Support Activity (SSA) and Software Development. RTSC will continue to provide avionics systems and software engineering to resolve post-production issues and develop enhancements for autopilot (a.k.a. Flight Director), navigation, control of communication systems, aircraft & engine health monitoring, mission management and mission planning correlation, sensors & electronic warfare management, and reporting and management of various other subsystems.  The SSA is responsible for issuing software suite updates to the V-22 fleet.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Delivery Order for this requirement.  The period of performance is to start 02 January 2008 through 31 December 2008.

<DESC>ADVANCED MICROCIRCUIT EMULATION (AME) IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM Broad Agency Announcement (BAA 07-FM-01)  The Defense Logistics Agency is soliciting proposals for its Advance Microcircuit Emulation (AME) Implementation Program.  The goal of the AME Implementation Program is developing advanced military quality (e.g. MIL-PRF-38535, etc.), economical, rapid, turn-key integrated emulation technology/process(es) and capability that are proven through hard FFF device/assembly demonstrations and LRIP (Low Rate Initial Production) FFF emulations in the major interest categories (application areas).  The AME Implementation Program must also maintain access to the technologies and devices developed under the predecessor AME and AME Validation Programs.  The Government desires the lowest possible resource commitment to maintain the successful AME technology, commencing at the earliest possible point (no later than LRIP).  Concepts must address self-sufficiency (profitability - defined as a non-subsidized, stand-alone, profitable capability to provide [within the scope of the AME technology] ongoing FFF emulated devices on demand) and should evidence a realistic early transition capability to a self-sufficient mode of operation.  This BAA focuses on the development, demonstration, and implementation of non-traditional methods of production and supply of non-procurable devices and assemblies.  It is expected that the AME Implementation Program will be the basis to develop and implement the capability to economically supply needs of DLA and the Services for currently non-procurable in-scope items and those becoming non-procurable for the next five to seven years.  It is also the vehicle to implement capability developed and/or fielded in the AME Validation Program. DLA may consider some, none, or all of the concepts for funding. The goal of AME is to reduce the number of items classed non-procurable and supply these previously non-procurable items at an attractive cost, thus increasing the support of the warfighter.  The existing DLA-funded digital emulation production capability may be roughly classed as military quality grade devices.  The existing DLA funded Low Rate Initial Production Capability may be described as including Application Specific Integrated Circuits up to 300,000 gates (down to 0.5 micron CMOS and up to 5 level metal) and 100 volt output  5 volt logic driver applications.  There is no technology transfer funding (or time) available to integrate any of these technologies to non-ready infrastructure for support.  The Government is willing to consider some, none, or all concepts that develop, implement, and demonstrate the following capabilities: 1)  Advanced Digital Devices:  This application area includes digital devices beyond current capability.  The desired capability may be broadly bounded by Large Scale Integration up through high-end devices. 2) Microprocessors and Microcontrollers:  This application area includes both early standard and custom microprocessors (4 bit and bit-slice) up through mid-term microprocessors (16 and 32 bit). 3) Memory:  This application area includes the broad RAM and ROM categories beyond the existing capabilities. 4) Programmable Logic Devices:  This category includes emulation of devices spanning the various types of of both programmable and field programmable devices. 5) Hybrid Microcircuits:  This application area includes hybrid microcircuits employing components from SSI up to the scale and complexity of the die in the accompanying application areas above. 6) Linear/Analog Devices:  This application area includes devices starting with the low end high performance operational amplifiers and continuing through advanced high performance analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) convertors. 7) Circuit Card Assemblies:  This application includes engineering services related to replacement of electronic assemblies or elements thereof with emulated FFF devices. The following are common desirable elements for concepts in meeting all of the above applications: 
Concepts whose principal elements have maximum applicability/compatibility across multi-application areas.  Concepts building on existing and/or state-of-the art processes and techniques are desirable.   Concepts that include comprehensive outreach to the DOD community (commercial and organic) are desirable.  Further details on individual topics are available in the BAA 07-FM-01 Proposer Information Package (PIP).  Proposals for individual efforts should not exceed five years in length.  Proposers must obtain the document BAA 07- FM-01 Proposer Information Package (PIP).  The PIP provides further information on areas of interest , the submission, evaluation, funding processes, proposal abstract format and proposal format.  The PIP will be sent via email.   This announcement will be open for 6 months from date of publication.  The first cut-off date for receipt of initial full proposals will be 30 days after the date of publication of this announcement.  Proposals received after the initial submission date will be reviewed after proposals received in the initial round.  Proposers must submit a proposal abstract in advance of actual proposals.  This should be submitted within ten (10) days after receipt of PIP.  This procedure is intended to minimize unnecessary effort in the proposal preparation and review.  The Government will attempt to review proposal abstracts within 8 working days after receipt of a proposal abstract and will make a binding decision as to whether an offeror propose a full formal submission(s).  Proposal abstracts will be reviewed as they are received.  Early submissions are strongly encouraged.  This announcement in conjunction with the PIP constitutes the total BAA.  No RFP or formal solicitation will be issued.  Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal using the criteria stipulated in the PIP.  All administrative correspondence and questions related to this announcement must be directed to the administrative contact below.  Proposal Abstracts may not be submitted by fax. The Administrative Address for this BAA is: Robert Sinagra, Defense Supply Center Columbus, ATTN: DSCC-FMGC, PO Box 3990, Columbus, OH 43218-3990.  Phone (614) 692-3623.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Carl Zeiss Microimaging, of Thornwood, New York, for the acquisition of an Inverted Fluorescence Microscope to be used by the Semiconductor Electronics Division at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

*** Sole source determination is based on the need for the inverted microscope to be completely compatible with existing Zeiss hardware in the MEMS laboratory.  Several Zeiss microscope systems currently exist in the MEMS laboratory.  These systems rely on the use of a wide variety of proprietary Zeiss hardware.  This proprietary hardware is essential to the function of Zeiss microscope systems and is not compatible or interchangeable with hardware from alternate vendors.  The new microscope system must be fully compatible with this hardware associated with existing Zeiss microscope systems.  This means that:

a) Existing Zeiss proprietary hardware in the laboratory must be compatible with the new microscope system purchased with this order.

b) New hardware purchased with this order must be compatible with existing Zeiss microscope systems in the laboratory.

This compatibility ensures maximum flexibility, utility and capability in the laboratory as proprietary Zeiss hardware can be exchanged as needed between Zeiss microscopes.  Carl Zeiss Microimaging is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required microscope.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Purchase of an automated Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography System (FPLC) with High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) capacity

Purpose/Brief History:

Two of the Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology (LMP) groups will be concomitantly using this instrument for their research.  The DNA replication group investigates how cells regulate the replication of their DNA. The group has identified DNA sequences likely to interact with cell cycle signaling molecules that control DNA replication. Subsequent studies have suggested that cells contain a protein that binds to this DNA sequence.  The next step will be to isolate and characterize protein(s) involved in this binding activity. A protein purification system is essential for the isolation of such proteins or protein complex. The topoisomerase, DNA enzyme targeting group investigates the response of cells to anti-cancer drugs that perturb cell cycle progression and DNA replication. This group characterizes molecules that are subject to phosphorylation following treatment with anti-cancer drugs. This group will use the protein purification system to isolate and characterize the amino acid phosphorylation patterns of protein targets from cells treated with anti-cancer drugs.

These studies are expected to yield new information regarding the regulation of cell growth under normal conditions and under conditions that can cause them to become cancerous and the response of cells to drugs used in the treatment of cancer. Understanding signals that lead from the cellular network that regulates growth to the genetic material may help clarify the differential sensitivity of particular cancer cells to specific drugs.  Proteins that convey those regulatory signals might serve as targets for the development of novel, specific anti-cancer drugs.
    
PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1)  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 
(2)  For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

Justification:

In order for the LMP to further their mission they need to have the capabilities provided by the GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AKTA Purifier 10.  There is no other vendor capable of delivering an instrument with the needed capabilities of the AKTA Purifier 10 which are detailed below.

The protein purification system must be based on fast flow liquid chromatography that includes the option for high pressure liquid chromatography which includes both fast flow and high pressure chromatograpy in a single purifier.  To achieve both fast flow and high pressure chromatograpy we require a flow rate range of .001-10 ml/min at pressures ranging from 0-3700 psi. 

Because the system will be used concomitantly by two groups it must contain a way to select desired columns without removing the tubing and fittings by which the columns are plumbed into the flow path.  The system must also include an automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, wash positions), which will allow for automated sample loading and a UV detector able to simultaneously monitor 3 wavelengths that are settable from the controller. 

Laboratory space is limited, therefore the equipment can not be any larger than 500 mm widthX460 mm depth x 620 mm height.  

The system use must be able to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity. Because of the heterogeneous sources we need a system capable of automating the running of large, open columns on the system, as well as a variety of gel filtration media. 

Because the resolution required may necessitate the use of very precise, shallow gradients, the system must have the following:
1.	A two- pump gradient system, with dynamic mixing.
2.	The entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides.
3.	A controller that allows time-based, volume-based, or Column-Volume based programming. The system must also allow for manual intervention while a programmed method is running.
4.	At least two motorized valves, one for the column inlets, one for the column outlets.  The desired column may be selected without removing the tubing and fittings by which the column is plumbed into the flow path, since such removal of fittings risks introduction of air into the column.
5.	The system must include one automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, wash positions), which will allow for automated sample loading.
6.	A UV detector able to simultaneously monitor 3 wavelengths that are settable from the controller. The systems UV detection lamp must turn on and off automatically when the system is running saving on lamp life in addition to being automatically calibrated every time the lamp turns on. At each start-up each component must perform an automatic self-diagnostic test and calibrate appropriate settings ensuring top performance throughout the day-to-day operation.
7.	The pumps, UV and conductivity monitors, valves, and fraction collector must all be specified for use in a cold room at 4 degrees C.
8.	A system controller to control four motorized valves, fraction collector, dynamic gradient mixer, and two pumps must all be possible from the system controller.
9.	The controller must allow the user to be entering details of the next purification at the same time the current separation is being done, or to simultaneously be integrating and evaluating the results of earlier runs. Data from the controlling system should be entered into word processing, spreadsheets, etc. that lie outside the operating program, without affecting currently running separations.
10.	The controller must accept seven input signals (e.g. 3 UV wavelengths, conductivity, pH, temperature, pressure). It must be capable of plotting, and integrating these signals, as well as using them to trigger sub-routines in the programming when the signal exceeds a preset threshold, to allow the automation of multi-dimensional separations.
11.	The system must have the ability to perform buffer blending and do this in a manner that is based on pKa and accounts for both ion concentration and temperature.
12.	The system controller must allow for the automation of the optimization of separation parameters (e.g. sample volume, flow rate, gradient slope, buffer pH).
13.	The system must be able to monitor column equilibration before and after sample injection and elution.
14.	The documentation of each run should be automatic and exhaustive, so that for purposes of subsequent replication and eventual publication, no detail is left un-recorded.  Post-run chromatographic analysis and reporting functions should also be included.
15.	The system must have a settable pressure limit, which will stop the pump and generate an audible and visual warning in the event pressure exceeds the preset limit.  
16.	The controller must allow the user to set commands which will automatically reduce the flow rate if an over-pressurization occurs as sample is being applied or eluted from the column.  Additional variables which should also be programmable to trigger sub-routines (e.g. new tube on fraction collector; valve changes; etc.) should include UV or conductivity signals.
17.	The system must have the ability to be interfaced with an autosampler, which will be controlled from the system software.
18.	The controller should permit automatic running of user-designated programs that change any single or several variables of choice, including: 
a.	turning off the pump flow when a signal is received from the fraction collector indicating there no tubes remaining, so that valuable sample is preserved.; 
b.	automatically and continuously record flow rate; auto-scaled UV signal ; actual and programmed conductivity of the eluent; eluent pH (with both ion concentration and temperature being accounted for); system pressure; accumulated time and volume of the run; all valve positions and changes in position; activity of a fraction collector
c.	the above recorded data should be available to be called up later for interpretation 
d.	enabling post-run analysis of chromatograms, export of data to other spreadsheet programs, and generation of custom written reports. All data must be easily exportable into ASCII format for importation into alternative programs ie. Excel or Word for publication and presentation.
e.	The evaluation software must be capable of custom reports, HETP calculations, Sigma, Resolution and Histograms in addition to overlaying multiple runs and performing numerous manipulations.  
19.	The software must contain template protocols for purification of synthetic peptides, labeled synthetic oligonucleotides, native peptides, and protein fragments in addition to templates for general chromatographic techniques e.g. gel filtration, RPC, affinity, IEX , HIC and CIP.  
20.	Installation, training and online help must be provided by the vendor because it will be operated by a multiple users. The system must have at least a 1 year warranty on all parts and service.

17.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a Task Order on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide services and products in the areas of V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS), V-22 Desktop Test Environment (DTE), V-22 Interactive Situational Awareness System (VISAS), Cabin Situational Awareness Upgrade (CSAU), V-22 Laboratory Management and Update, and V-22 Avionics Simulation Software. This effort requires intricate knowledge of avionics systems, V-22 avionics simulation software, V-22 avionics laboratories, and related products used by the V-22 platform, which is poised for three key program milestones - Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for MV-22 occurring in FY08, Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for CV-22, also occurring in FY08, and CV-22 IOC in FY09.  RTSC is the only known source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting schedule and cost constraints of the program: 

(A) V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS).  The VMPS is comprised of two Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs).  The VMPS CSCIs are the Joint Mission Planning Software (JMPS), which is the software framework that is used as a basis for VMPS, and the V-22 Unique Planning Component (UPC) that implements V-22 unique mission planning functionality.  The JMPS framework is provided as GFE, and RTSC integrates the V-22 UPC into the JMPS framework.  The VMPS has been procured from RTSC under a multi-year ongoing phased developmental effort.  . 

(B) Desktop Test Environment (DTE).  DTE software takes all of the Avionics Software Simulation products (in paragraph (E) below) and migrates them from a Unix-based workstation to a Personal Computer (PC) environment.  Additionally, DTE will allow software developers to have a "virtual lab" available on their desktop to help test and develop avionics software.

(C) V-22 Interactive Situational Awareness System (VISAS) Development and Production.  The VISAS was designed and developed by RTSC.  It is a system that will connect to the Troop Commander Panel provided in the V-22 passenger cabin, and will provide situational awareness data to V-22 passengers.  The VISAS uses simulation software products developed by RTSC.  This is an ongoing project that has been in development for several years, and will continue to be updated during the MV-22 Block C and CV-22 Block 20 developments. 
(D)  Cabin Situational Awareness Upgrade (CSAU).  The CSAU for MV-22 Block B and CV-22 aircraft consists of mission kits (i.e. MTX, aircraft wiring, & Cabin SA Device-CSAD/GPS Repeater) which will enhance situational awareness for these platforms.  The CSAD is a derivative of the VISAS product described above.  The Situational Awareness capabilities will provide aircraft state information, such as flight plans, threats, communication plans, weather situation, and other aircraft situational awareness. 

(E) V-22 Laboratory Management and Update, and Avionics Software Simulation Products. The main avionics facility that is used by all RTSC Indianapolis projects is the V-22 Avionics Integration Laboratory (VAIL).  RTSC will continue to expand the VAIL capabilities as new hardware is received to support the Software Support Activity (SSA).  Avionics Software Simulation Products were designed and developed by RTSC and include V-22 Dynamic Display System (VDDS), Simulation Control (SIMCNTRL), JVX Simulation Support Software-Automated Test Tool (JSSS-ATT), Virtual Emulated Mission Data Loader (VEMDL) and Bus Controller Tool (BC-Tool).   

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Delivery Order for this requirement.  The period of performance is to start 02 January 2008 through 31 December 2008.  The estimated issue date for this Order is 02 January 2008.  Services under current contract number N00019-05-G-0008-3002 with Raytheon Technical Services Corporation expire 31 December 2007.

Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in contest of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions, and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Reference Numbered Note 22.  The U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Smiths Detection, 2202 Lakeside Blvd, Edgewood, MD 21040 for the award of a Low Rate Initial Productio n (LRIP) contract for 6,000 M4 JCADs, 320 M4 communications adapters, and 320 Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) platform interface kits. A firm-fixed price production contract will be awarded.  The JCAD Single Acquisition Management Plan (SAMP) document s the JCAD Acquisition Strategy for the JCAD evolutionary program plan. The JCAD SAMP was approved September 12, 2005 by Mr. Kenneth Krieg, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  The award of this LRIP contract by other than full and open competition is in accordance with the Contract Strategy paragraph of the approved SAMP.  Smiths Detection is the only source that can produce and deliver the supplies without substantial duplication of costs to the Government.  A sources -sought market survey in April 2004 identified commercial systems that claimed to demonstrate potential to meet the performance requirements of JCAD Increment 1.  The government procured test items from each of the contractors for PQT.  Upon conclusion of the PQT, the government determined that only the Smiths Detection version met the performance requirements of JCAD Increment 1.  Questions of a contractural nature are to be submitted to Romona F. Kelly, Contract Specialist, romona.kelly@us.army.mil, phone  (410) 436-7743.

Bull trout movements will be tracked for up to a year to provide a better picture o f seasonal bull trout movements. The size of bull trout tagged for the study will be determined by tag size.  Tags that last 6 months to a year are fairly large and suitable for use in larger sub-adult bull trout only.   The study will target the East River where the bull trout still exibit adfluvial life history traits, and where large numbers of bull trout have been previously observed.  The study may also attempt capture of bull trout in Lake Pend Orielle or Priest Lake  if time permits and capture is feasible.  Movements of tagged fish will be monitored to elicit timing of out migrations from the Priest River.

<DESC>This notice is to provide an update to the status of the acquistion package. As of 12 Jun 2007, the package still has not been signed off at the OC-ALC level due to delays caused by changeover in the command section, TDYs, etc. Nothing has changed in the plan being reviewed, nor do we expect it to. It is hoped the package will be forwarded to the Pentagon no later than Jun 19, 2007. This will make an RFP issuance by Jun 25, 2007 highly unlikely. No estimated date of RFP issuance is available at this time. Updates will be posted as they become available. No significant delays or revisions are expected, it's just the routine process of having a package of this magnitude approved.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the release of its updated DRAFT Joint Precision and Approach Landing System (JPALS) System Development and Demonstration (SDD) solicitation with Sections L and M.  This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition. Contract award is anticipated in the second quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2008. This DRAFT SOLICITATION and its attached documents/exhibits will be listed at the website "Doing Business with NAVAIR", http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations and the Joint Precision and Approach Landing System (JPALS) website, http://pma213.navair.navy.mil/systems/jpals.htm. JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system that will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a family of systems that are more affordable, function in more operational environments, and support all Department of Defense (DoD) Land and Sea Based applications. The National Defense Strategy of the United States of America calls for highly mobile forces that can rapidly respond to crises worldwide. Success in meeting this challenge requires the ability to land aviation assets virtually anywhere, at any time. JPALS will provide this capability by being rapidly deployable, survivable and interoperable among the U.S. Services and with our allies, as well as with civil aircraft and landing facilities. The JPALS capability will be incrementally acquired and incorporated into the DoD inventory of warfighting assets. Sea Based JPALS has been designated as Increment 1. The program is scheduled for a Milestone B decision in the 2nd Quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 with Sea Based JPALS (Increment 1) Initial Operational Capability (IOC) planned for FY14. The proposed system architecture will be driven by the requirements and constrained by the program schedule and affordability goals contained in the solicitation and in the JPALS Systems Requirements Document (SRD). Interested parties can view/download the Draft RFP N00019-07-R-0044) including its attachments: SOO, DD254, GFI List and GFI documents, and the Contract Data Requirements List (Data Items A001 through A115).

<DESC>This is a Solicitation Notice.  The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) has a requirement entitled "Continued Operation of the Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS)."

The APIS web site (http://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov) is an online resource that provides public access to detailed information on a wide variety of alcohol-related public policies.  Intended primarily as a tool for researchers, APIS features compilations and tabulations of alcohol-related statutes and regulations.  APIS is designed to simplify the process of ascertaining the status of the law for researchers who wish to study the effects and effectiveness of alcohol-relate policies.

APIS inaugurated its public web site in June 2003.  Since that time it has been updated on a continuous basis to add new policy topics, update information on policy topics previously covered, add new features and capabilities, and clarify or correct previously published information.  Additional information about alcohol-related public policies is available through the links on the APIS Homepage. (http://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov)

APIS contributes to the mission of the NIAAA by publishing data on line that supports research to (1) assess the effects of alcohol-related policies, both individually and in combination, on a wide variety of important health, social, and economic outcomes, and (2) identify and evaluate factors that enhance or inhibit the effectiveness of these policies.

Requirements and Tasks:  The purpose of the APIS project is to continue the publication on the APIS web site of accurate, authoritative, detailed, and comparable information on alcohol-related public policies at both the State and Federal level

The requirements include: 

(1) identifying and acquiring accurate and detailed information on alcohol-related policies adopted at the Federal and State levels through appropriate electronic resources; 
(2) describing alcohol-related policies at several levels of detail, including descriptive overviews and detailed characterizations of specific policy provisions, (including the specific dates on which such provisions became or ceased to be effective); 
(3) storing the policy information, including all related descriptions, keywords, indicators, and variables in an electronic system that permits on-line search and retrieval of policy information by a variety of flexible criteria; 
(4) operating and maintaining the APIS web site; and, 
(5) implementing and employing rigorous quality assurance procedures to ensure the utility, reliability and integrity of the system and its various components.  

The Request for Proposal is also available at http://www.niddk.nih.gov/fund/RFP/NIAAA-07-08.

Proposals are due to the Contracting Officer on or before 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time on 13 July 2007.

<DESC>The deadline for questions in section L.4 of the solicitation is in error. It should read "All questions must be received by 4:00PM on 6/21/07 to ensure you receive an answer". This provides ten days for you to formulate your questions. Submittal by email is permissable and preferred. There may not be time to answer questions received after the deadline and time extensions will not be granted for late questions in most circumstances.


The Department of State (DOS) has a current requirement for telecommunications cable system design, installation and testing services. We anticipate awarding four  IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) contracts .  Each contract will have a 12-month base year plus four 12-month Options. The contract ceiling is $2M per contract over 5 years.  Estimated  performance start date is June 2007.

The delivery orders will usually be for testing installed telecommunications cables systems at US Embassies and other diplomatic posts around the world but may require design and installation of systems at overseas posts on an infrequent basis.  The offer must be able to provide a Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) Archetect, A RCDD engineer and experienced Senior and Junior technicians.

This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541380 and the small business size standard is $11M.

In order to be considered for award of this contract, interested offerors, including all entities which comprise a joint venture, and the joint venture itself, must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Final Secret, Interim Top Secret or Final Top Secret facility clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. At least two contracts will be awarded to firms currently possessing Interim or Final Top Secret FCLs, while firms with Final Secret FCLs may be selected for one or more additional awards.  Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.
Selected firms possessing a Final Secret FCL will be sponsored by Department of State for an FCL upgrade to the Top Secret level. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the upgraded clearance. A period of 90 days from the date of selection for award will be allowed for the Secret cleared firm to obtain an Interim Top Secret FCL.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider not awarding the contract to the selected offeror.
Due to time constraints, the Government will not delay award of contracts to selected firms already in possession of Interim and Final Top Secret FCLs.  Contractor personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances issued by DSS prior to performance on the contract.

In reading the PWS, it's unclear to me as to whether this solicitation includes all development and maintenance of the www.army.mil website, or if it's focused only on the Strategic Communications aspect of OCPA only producing web products for a handfu l of Army publications. I'm familiar with both contracts, and the PWS could seemingly apply to either. Answer:  This requirement belongs to the Plans Division who has to be able to have interaction with U.S.Army.Mil website.  This one does not include all development and maintenance of the www.army.mil Website.  This will support the 3 + 2 + 1 Initiative an d has to be able to work closely with the site to promote some of the products and missions of Initiative 7 and OCPA. 5.  Can you please clarify the meaning of standard size of $6M is encouraged to submit....  Does this mean that our firms revenue over the last three years should not average over $6M? Answer:  Yes.

The successful Contractor will be required to establish and maint ain a nationwide network of health care providers.  A single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract will be awarded to the offeror that provides the Best Value to the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSCG23-07-R-DNQ160.  This solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP) under NAICS code 336612 (size standard, 500 employees) on a full and open basis.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a need for Special Purpose Craft ? Near-Shore Lifeboat (SPC-NLB) vessels that will be operated in varying sea and weather conditions, along the entire coast of the United States.  The SPC-NLB will be used as a fast response boat and utility boat from a USCG shore station and will frequently have to operate in shallow water (3ft 6in maximum draft) and transit surf (15ft minimum breaking sea) conditions.  The SPC-NLB shall be inherently self righting and self bailing, designed to re-right after a knock down or complete rollover and continue with the assigned mission with no or minimal degradation of operational capability.  The SPC-NLB will be a standard USCG mission multi-mission asset operated with a crew of four.  Typical missions include search and rescue, recreational boating safety, law enforcement, and Port, Waterways, and Coastal Security (including ferry boat escorts).  The vessel will have a forward and aft gun mount to accommodate the M240 machine gun during PWCS missions.  The enclosed cabin shall provide four shock mitigating seats for the crew.  This shore-based asset is not intended for Cutter deployment.  The vessel shall have twin four stroke diesel engines with reversing gears and waterjets.   The specifications for the platform are provided in Amendment 1 to this combined synopsis/solicitation. 

As a result of this solicitation, it is anticipated that a Firm-Fixed Priced Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with provisions for issuance of delivery orders will be awarded.  The period of performance will be five (5) years from date of award.  It is anticipated that the Government will order a minimum of 1 SPC-NLB with associated support line items and a maximum of four (4) SPC-NLBs with associated support line items.  Offerors shall provide prices for the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) for each of the five years in accordance with the price spreadsheet as provided in Amendment 1 to this combined synopsis/solicitation.

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE:  The Contractor shall deliver the NLB and associated support CLINs not later than 180 days after receipt of the delivery order for the first boat and 30 days for each subsequent boat ordered thereafter.  An expedited delivery of the first platform is strongly encouraged and shall be considered in evaluation for award.  Should there be a pending order that has not yet been fulfilled; the next consecutive boat ordered shall be delivered within 30 days after the last boat on the previous order.  The delivery locations will be identified in each applicable Delivery Order.  The anticipated delivery locations are the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to deliver the boat, with the ability to place the NLB on the cradle and/or in the water upon delivery, at the respective delivery locations.  Whether the NLB will be required to be placed on the cradle or in the water upon delivery will be identified in each applicable Delivery Order.  All associated support CLINS that are ordered concurrent with the boat are to be delivered at the same time as the boat, unless otherwise identified in the applicable order.  All Provisioning Technical Documentation shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer or the COTR.  The exact addresses will be identified in the applicable Delivery Order.

The U.S. Coast Guard inspection and pre-acceptance trials will be conducted at the Contractor?s facility, prior to shipment of each NLB.  The inspection and pre-acceptance efforts are expected to take 2-3 days.  Final acceptance of the NLB and all support CLIN items shall be at the designated delivery location as stated in the applicable Delivery Order.  The first platform will be delivered to Ilwaco, WA for extended testing and evaluating of the platform and its self-righting ability.  

AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS TO PLACE ORDERS:  Only a Contracting Officer residing in G-ACS, USCG Headquarters, Washington, DC may place orders under this IDIQ contract.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation: (1) FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998).  This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.  The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its offer.  In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its offer.  Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es): http://www.arnet.gov. (2) FAR 52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998).  (3) FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2006).  (4) FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award the contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government offering the best value, price and other factors considered.   The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) Vessel Operational Capability and Physical Characteristics; Proposals will be evaluated on their demonstrated ability to produce and deliver a boat that enables the USCG to effectively perform mission critical operations and that performs at a consistently high level. The proposed configuration of the vessel will be evaluated for ease of use and maintainability. Human engineering will also be evaluated to ensure that the boat is laid out in a manner that enables the crew to move freely, so as not to inhibit them from performing mission critical operations effectively. The ability to conduct search and rescue operations (particularly search execution, PIW recovery, and towing astern in surf/heavy weather), alongside towing, law enforcement/defense operations, and mission readiness are to be evaluated as these are  the primary functions of the boats.  The proposed boat design maturity, ability to maintain the level of performance as set forth in the requirements, maintenance with minimal down time in the field will also be evaluated. Greater importance will be given to proposals that meet stated Objective levels of performance in the specification.  (2) Production Capability; Proposals will be evaluated on their demonstrated capability to produce and deliver boats at the rate and quantity stated herein, with emphasis on an accelerated delivery of the first boat.  The evaluation will focus on the Offeror?s facilities, equipment, and experience.  (3) Quality Assurance and Management; Proposals will be evaluated on their demonstrated ability to provide an overall management structure to ensure quality boats are produced, tested, delivered and supported in a timely manner, and in accordance with the Specification.  Great importance will be given to the offeror's demonstrated ability to ensure consistency in quality; ensure the configuration management of the boat; adequate management control of the standardization program and subcontractors; and evidence of their quality assurance capabilities.  (4) Warranty Terms and Warranty Plan; Proposals will be evaluated on their demonstrated ability to provide efficient and effective warranty support to the USCG/CBP after the boats are in use in the field, to include the time required to affect repairs after receipt of notification from the Government; (5)  Relevant Past Performance; Past performance will be evaluated in terms of Quality; Timeliness of Performance; Business Relations; and Customer Satisfaction. If no relevant past performance information is available, offerors will be given a neutral rating.  Provide 3 recent past performance references of similar contracts currently in place, delivery orders, purchase orders, or a combination of all done within the past 3 years.  Similar contracts listed may include any contract entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial customers.  Include the following information: (a) Name of Contract Activity; (b) Contract Number, (c) Contract Type; (d) Total Contract Value; (e) Description of Item(s), (f) Contracting Officer Name, Telephone Number and e-mail address; (g) Program Manager Name and Telephone Number (if applicable); (h) Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative Name and Telephone Number; and (i) Administrative Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative, if different from (f), and e-mail address.   (6) Price.   Prices will be evaluated for price reasonableness as follows:  The Boat CLIN will be evaluated separately and then all other CLINS will be evaluated collectively.  Offerors proposed price should include a calculated subtotal for each year and a calculated total overall price.  Pricing should also include any discounts offered for quantity orders or alternate payment arrangements (i.e. 3rd party purchase).  The total evaluated price will be the sum of all CLINs for the entire potential ordering period of the IDIQ contract (five years).  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices are significantly unbalanced.  Although the ceiling for the IDIQ contract will be for four (4), pricing of one (1) boat each is required for each of the five (5) years of the contract for evaluation purposes.  The Government will evaluate the offeror?s price for award purposes of each year within the period of performance within the resultant contract.  The table shows only one (1) boat per year, however, the Government may order more or fewer boats in any particular year, up to the ceiling of four (4) boats over the five (5) year ordering period.

In addition to what?s required by FAR 52.212-1, the offeror shall provide information to support the areas of consideration in each applicable evaluation factor that will be evaluated for award as stated above.

The Government will award the contract to the offeror who has the best overall value on the basis of its offer and its capability to perform the work.  The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of important, with the first evaluation factor being significantly important than all other non-price related factors.  When all evaluation factors are combined, non-price factors are more important than price, ?end of provision?.  Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (JUN 2006), with their offer.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the following address: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 Second Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, DC  20593, and Phone: (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011

<SOLNBR>M07RS13346
<RESPDATE>071207
<ARCHDATE>06112008
<CONTACT>Olivia Adrian Contract Specialist 7037871151     Olivia.Adrian@mms.gov;
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER) DESCRIPTION: This announcement solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length for specific topics of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER). For your information, the MMS web site has descriptions of OSER activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects. The web site address is: http://www.mms.gov/tarphome/index.htm.  BACKGROUND:  Research sponsored by MMS through the TA&R Program is used to acquire basic engineering information needed to oversee the orderly development of offshore oil and gas operations. New challenges and informational needs arise as companies use new equipment or procedures based on technological changes or as operations expand into new or different environments such as the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2008 funds. The MMS anticipates a total of approximately $ 1,000,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSER topics in FY 2008 with projects being identified through this announcement. NOTICE: MMS may share the white papers with other organizations for review. Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want the Papers/proposals shared.  OBJECTIVE: The topics for the FY 2008 OSER activities include ONLY research on the following:  The topics for the FY 2008 OSER activities include ONLY research on the following:  1. Investigate the Causes and Probabilities of Riser Failure for Workovers, Redrills and Sidetracks in Hybrid Wells, Through the Existing Risers, With a Surface BOP.   Hybrids wells are wells drilled in deep water as subsea well but are completed with dual or single bore risers and surface trees. Investigate the causes and probabilities of riser failure (particularly single bore risers) and possible prevention and remediation.  During these well operations, risers that have been exposed to years of corrosion and VIV are subjected to wear from rotating pipe within the riser.  The potential exists for riser failure due to fatigue or a riser penetration due to corrosion or wear during well intervention operations resulting in loss of well control. 2. Evaluate the Reliability (Probability of Failure) Versus Consequence of Failure when incorporating the new API RP 2MET Criteria into the 21st Edition API RP 2A. The environmental criteria set in API RP 2MET and 21st Edition API RP 2A may vary significantly in some regions; however the total effects on fixed offshore structures can not be determined simply by reviewing each of the components individually (i.e., wave height, current speed, wind speed, etc.). This research will involve comparing the new met ocean criteria for each of the four new Gulf of Mexico regions contained in API RP 2MET versus the High, Medium and Low Consequence Criteria contained in the 21st edition API RP 2A for each depth zone (shallow, intermediate, and deep). The research would be based on common types of fixed offshore platforms and determine total base shears, deck height requirements, and the reliability or probability of failure of the structure.  The research should be conducted concurrent with the development of, and prior to the publishing of, the 22nd edition API RP 2A. 3.  Assess Risk and Model a Sudden Gas Release Due to a Gas Pipeline Rupture on the Pacific OCS.  At a minimum, the project should include an analysis of the gas volume, duration, and rate of release; effects of dissolution in water and water temperature, pressure, current, salinity (etc.); effects of water depth (up to 5000 ft WD) and distance from shore (up to 30 miles); nature and behavior of gas as the plume travels to the water surface and disperses above sea level; area and duration of potential surface impacts with regard to public safety, sea life, and the environment; and potential for pipeline failure of existing pipeline infrastructure.  4.  Assess Smart-pigging Options (Other Than Tethered or Water Propelled Pigs) for Low Pressure, Low Volume Gas Pipelines on the Pacific OCS That Can Ensure Pipeline Integrity and Advance Inspection Beyond Current Operations. 5. Reduce Lateral Noise Propagation from Seismic Exploration Vessels. Test and assess the effectiveness of potential methods to reduce the lateral propagation of sound sources from oil industry seismic exploration in the Alaskan Beaufort and Chukchi Seas where oil exploration activities are currently taking place or are planned. This research could include a literature synthesis and review to identify existing seismic exploration technologies (air guns) and promising methods and technologies that could reduce the lateral propagation of sound. This research could also include performance testing, evaluation, assessment and comparison of noise reduction technologies that could be used to reduce the lateral propagation of sound sources from seismic exploration vessels.  6.  Recent hurricanes, determine why there was a lack of fixed structure foundation failures where current analyses indicate they would have been expected. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to safety and pollution practices for offshore operations. As a result of review of the White Papers, proposals will be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should address the above stated issues. HOW TO RESPOND:  White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Ms Olivia Adrian, not later than July 12, 2007 at 04:00 PM, EDT. WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. White Papers should define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort. NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED. The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merit. If your white paper is selected for further evaluation, a proposal shall be requested and you must also submit a cost proposal at that time. Projects shall be selected from all or part of the technical issues listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received. The MMS shall evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit shall be furnished information to assist in the preparation of a complete proposal. This announcement constitutes a Request for White Papers, but does not obligate the Government to consummate award.

<DESC>PROBLEM: Current vehicle and cargo handling methods aboard ships require an inordinate amount of time and deck space to maneuver items into stowage locations and to extract them (i.e. jockeying around corners, parallel parking, etc,).  These methods also require that a large amount of deck space remain open as maneuver area to facilitate offloading and is therefore lost as a stowage area.  In order to maximize the use of available deck space on ships, a system or device is needed that facilitates the "dense packing" of vehicles and cargo, and enables access to specific items (i.e. selective access) after the ship has been loaded and is at-sea.  DESCRIPTION: The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) are seeking information from potential sources that can provide technologies, systems, or devices for omnidirectional movement of vehicles and cargo aboard ships at sea.   The technology, system or device must be capable of omnidirectional movement, of operating safely in dynamic shipboard environments subject to roll, pitch and heave motions, and of operating across impediments normally found on the deck of  Large Medium Speed Roll-on Roll-off (LMSR) ships and Amphibious ships of the US Navy, such as small debris, nonskid paint or tape, weld seams, recesses and gripe holes (recessed tie-down sockets) in the deck.  While multiple implementations may be necessary to handle all the vehicles and cargo required, the technology, system or device proposed must be capable in some form of lifting and moving all military wheeled or tracked vehicles used by the Marine Corps, as well as standard 20-foot containers.   Vehicles may be categorized into types, with separate solutions for each type; for example, categories might be light vehicles (all HMMWV, M101 trailers), medium vehicles (MTVR, M105 trailer, LAV), heavy vehicles (LVS, M970 Refueler), tracke!  d vehicles (AAV, M1A2 Tank), and containers (TEU, ISO).  Similarly, we are interested in technologies capable of moving any substantial subset of the cargo listed above (eg, all the wheeled vehicles but nothing else, or all the tracked vehicles but nothing else).   Wheeled vehicles range in weight from 6,000 lbs (for an empty HMMWV) to 70,000 lbs (for a loaded MTVR) and have a variety of axle arrangements; tracked vehicles range in weight from 45,000 lbs (AAV) to 144,000 lbs (M1A2 Tank).  The technology, system or device must be capable of approaching, lifting and moving vehicles and containers into and out of stowage spots with access to only one side of the vehicle or container, and moving that vehicle or container in any required direction, or pivot the load 360o within the footprint of the vehicle.  The system must be capable of moving vehicles without requiring them to drive onto the system or device.   Vehicles in open areas should be able to drive on or off the system or device.  Since overhead space aboard an LMSR or Amphibious ship is limited, and since vehicles are often densely packed, the technology, system or device for moving vehicles must be capable of operating with limited lift height and limited access. Potential sources of solutions are requested to respond with a white paper of 5 to no more than 10 pages containing a complete conceptual description of the technology, system, or device, including lift method, omnidirectional movement, power sources, utilities required, methods to ensure safe operations on sloped or moving decks, and technical maturity level (i.e., developmental, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), modified COTS, etc.).  Additional information may include the following: process description, current commercial or military applications, processing rate capability, physical size, maintenance requirements, operational manning requirements, power consumption per hour of operation, and system cost.  Responses to this synopsis are requested no later than 27 July 2007. This synopsis is for information purposes and to identify potential technologies and offerors. This sources sought announcement does not constitute an RFP and does not obligate the government in any way!   to purchase or test any of the potential solutions offered. Further, it does not commit the government to pay for any proposal costs in response to the sources sought announcement.  Submit responses for this synopsis to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Attn: Glenn Gregory, Code 2120, 9500 MacArthur Blvd, West Bethesda, Maryland 20817; questions about this document may be emailed to glenn.gregory@navy.mil

<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Radiology Center (RC) for a new six-year multi-center clinical research study entitled, SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS).  This observational study will collect and analyze phenotypic, biomarker, genetic, genomic, and clinical data from several thousand research subjects with COPD.  

Baseline data will be analyzed in a cross-sectional manner to identify subpopulations of patients with similar molecular abnormalities.  Longitudinal data will be used to identify and validate intermediate outcome measures, such as x-ray computed tomographic (CT) image, biomarker, and genomic measures whose spontaneous changes over a period of 9-12 months correlate with long-term (3 year) outcomes of mortality, frequency of hospitalizations, change in spirometry, and change in quality of life.  Secondary aims are to develop a bioinformatic infrastructure that will enable the utilization and sharing of pulmonary research data and to create a collection of clinical, biomarker, radiographic, and genetic data that can be used by external investigators for other studies of COPD.  

Research subjects will be enrolled, phenotyped, and followed at approximately eight Clinical Centers (CCs) solicited under a separate request for proposals.  A Genomics and Informations Center with have primary responsibility for operating a repository of biospecimens; developing bioinformatic resources; designing and implementing a strategy for data collection and analysis to identify subpopulations and intermediate outcome measures which includes molecular phenotypic data obtained with high throughput genetic and genomic assays; training CC staff; managing study data; providing overall management and oversight of the study; and disseminating study results.  The Radiology Center will have primary responsibility for:  1) providing expertise in radiology and chest computed tomographic (CT imaging); 2) standardizing imaging methods at the Clinical Center;  3) establishing a repository of CT image data for SPIROMICS; 4) assessing and assuring quality of CT images; and 5) analyzing lung CT images to obtain quantitative measures that may indicate the presence and/or severity of COPD or other lung diseases.  The RC must provide expertise in lung image acquisition, processing, and analysis and must have experience in directing lung CT imaging in multi-center clinical research.  This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to awarding a contract pursuant to this announcement.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV,  Field Studies Branch of the Division of Resporatory Disease Studies would like to issue a purchase order for  the procurement of analytical services for speciated culturable fungi, bacteria (gram positive, negative, broad spectrum, and three most predominant genus identification), Actinomycetes (total:  room temperature, mesophilic, and thermophilic), speciated culturable mycobacteria, and allergens (Cat, dog, two types of dust mites, and cockroach allergens) analyses of floor dust samples.

NIOSH has an ongoing multi-year research program which includes investigations of building dampness, fungal contamination and respiratory health effects in office buildings and schools, for which we need to compare results across individual studies.  Environmental Microbiology Laboratory has previously analyzed samples collected for studies within this program.  Culturable fungi bacterial analyses have a high degree of potential variability due to a number of factors, including culture techniques, as well as enumeration and identification techniques.  Differences in laboratory protocols and procedures could lead to potentially significant differences  in fungal and bacterial species identification and quantification, which may affect the validity of comparison across studies.  Therefore, it is very important that we keep the same laboratory (Environmental Microbiological Laboratory) to obtain comparable results using consistent methods across individual studies within the program.

This notice is issued for informational purposes only.  Any interested party must demonstrate in writing their ability to meet the requirements outlined above to the contracting officer no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Submit information to Rebecca Mullenax, Reference: 000HCCHB-2007-41538, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505 or Fax to 304-285-6083 or e-mail RMULLENAX@CDC.GOV.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources exist, therefore, no solicitation will be issued.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received within 15 days, award will be made to Environmental microbiology Laboratory, Inc. without further notices being issued.

<DESC>This serves as a sources sought notice and market survey to locate qualified businesses capable of providing screening test plates for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).  The Fast Antimicrobial Screen Test (FAST) and the Swab Test on Premises (STOP) are biological screening tests for the detection of antimicrobial residues in animal tissues.  In these tests, cotton swabs saturated with tissue fluid from a suspected carcass are placed on a culture plate whose surface has been seeded with spores of a harmless organism (Bacillus megaterium spores for the FAST test and Bacillus subtilis spores for STOP).  The potential contractor must provide the FAST and STOP agar plates, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis spores, and quality control for both on an as needed basis by the USDA mostly in large volumes (up to 35,000 plates and 4,000 vials of spores per order).  Business concerns having the capability to provide the described supplies are invited to submit appropriate documentation demonstrating past experience manufacturing this type of supply.  This information will allow the Government to determine what sources are available and interested.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325413, In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  Potential sources should indicate in their response their business status (i.e., small business, 8(a), HUBZone, etc.)  This information will be used to determine whether the procurement can be set-aside for small business concerns.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The Government is not requesting technical or management proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this sources sought notice.  Your responses will be used solely for market research purposes of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this notice and submittals will not be returned to the sender.  If a solicitation is later released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any synopsis or solicitation.  Interested qualified businesses are requested to submit a package delineating qualifications, capabilities, and experience for providing the supplies described herein.  Include information on your company?s managerial and technical resources to be able to meet the requirements.  Companies must sufficiently demonstrate that they have actual experience in providing screening test plates, the capability to provide this supply, and qualifications in all previous work pertinent to this effort.  Responses should also include the following: name and address of firm; size of business; number of years in business; and list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and point of contact with address and phone number).  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  Responses may be submitted by email to Julian.McElveen@fsis.usda.gov; or by mail to Julian McElveen at USDA, FSIS, ASD, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Maildrop 5230, Beltsville, MD 20705-5230; or by fax at 301-504-4276.

<CONTACT>Joanne Deshler, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-0340, Fax (301) 480-3338, Email deshlerj@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Genomics and Informatics Center (GIC) for a new six-year multi-center clinical research study entitled, SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS).  This observational study will collect and analyze phenotypic, biomarker, genetic, genomic, and clinical data from several thousand research subjects with COPD.  

Baseline data will be analyzed in a cross-sectional manner to identify subpopulations of patients with similar molecular abnormalities.  Longitudinal data will be used to identify and validate intermediate outcome measures, such as x-ray computed tomographic (CT) image, biomarker, and genomic measures whose spontaneous changes over a period of 9-12 months correlate with long-term (3 year) outcomes of mortality, frequency of hospitalizations, change in spirometry, and change in quality of life.  Secondary aims are to develop a bioinformatic infrastructure that will enable the utilization and sharing of pulmonary research data and to create a collection of clinical, biomarker, radiographic, and genetic data that can be used by external investigators for other studies of COPD.  

Research subjects will be enrolled, phenotyped, and followed at approximately eight Clinical Centers (CCs) solicited under a separate request for proposals.   High throughput genetic, genomic, and proteomic analyses of biospecimens will be performed by core laboratories contracted separately.  The GIC will have primary responsibility for operating a repository of biospecimens; developing bioinformatic resources; designing and implementing a strategy for data collection and analysis to identify subpopulations and intermediate outcome measures which includes molecular phenotypic data obtained with high throughput genetic and genomic assays; training CC staff; managing study data; providing overall management and oversight of the study; and disseminating study results.  Specifically, the GIC will: 1) provide expertise in genetic, genomic, and proteomic analyses; 2) provide expertise in bioinformatics, including development of controlled vocabularies and metadata elements; 3) provide biostatistical support for study design and protocol development, including sample size calculations or simulations; 4) analyze the study data; 5) provide administrative support and oversight for the study as a whole; 6) process and store biospecimens collected at the CCs; 7) coordinate, plan, make arrangements for, and participate in meetings of the study committees and boards; 8) develop and maintain web sites for study investigators; 9) establish and maintain a computer system and software needed for the storage and analysis of study data; 10) prepare and distribute periodic technical and statistical reports of study activities and progress; and 11) coordinate and track the reporting of adverse events.  GIC staff must possess strong scientific qualifications related to bioinformatics, biostatistics, genetics, genomics, and proteomics.  The GIC must have pulmonary medical expertise, experience in the supervision of complex multi-center clinical studies, and experience in the statistical analysis of high volume genetic, genomic, proteomic, and phenotypic data.

Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this study should submit documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer.  The capability statement submitted should include:  1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientist, and technical personnel, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, and 4) an outline of previous research projects in which the small business organization and the proposed personnel have participated and any other information relevant to this program.  
 The capabilities statement must not exceed 8 single sided or 4 double sided pages in length. 

Interested small business organizations submitting a capability statement are required to identify their size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration.  The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI.   However, responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is propriety will be properly safeguarded for Government use only.  Questions, concerns and responses should be emailed to Ms. Joanne Deshler at deshlerj@nhlbi.nih.gov.  Responses shall be submitted in Adobe Acrobat PDF format by 3p.m. eastern standard time June 27, 2007, and include the name and telephone numbers of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. When submitting this information, please reference the solicitation notice number. Responses received after the due date may not be reviewed.

This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  If this program is approved for implementation and it is determined to be a small business set aside, then a competitive RFP will be available in FedBizOpps.

<DESC>A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of  Safety Needles & Syringes.  The major facilities in the area includes: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination for Safety Needles & Syringes that represents the clinically preferred product from a source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 
 
     This procurement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program for their distribution of your products.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined on a best value basis.    
   
Point of Contact is Greg Morrison, 757-953-5804 or gregory.morrison@med.navy.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Mid-Atlantic Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Needles & Syringes. The approximate annual purchase volume of $417,000 is based upon the historical usage of standardized Safety Needles & Syringes over a one year period. 

 The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final award recommendation will be determined on a ?best value? basis.

 The Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region is Owens & Minor.  

At the request of the Mid-Atlantic Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Offerors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative, should email responses to gregory.morrison@med.navy.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) (3) your company?s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) number and (4) your company?s responses to the questions under paragraph D.2, Technical/Company Criteria below.  Your email will include your agreement to provide the necessary technical criteria, ?no charge? samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers that represent a discount from your company?s base uncommitted DAPA pricing.  Failure to provide the information requested in the timeframes specified will result in your company being eliminated from further consideration.

Note: Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.

Email responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M (EST), seven (7) calendar days from the closing of this FBO Notice.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from future participation in this standardization effort.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to gregory.morrison@med.navy.mil




D.	 Evaluation Criteria

Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria below.  A Clinical Product Team (CPT) will review the responses and determine acceptability. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Those companies who do meet the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  
For those companies meeting the criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to provide samples (at no cost to the government) to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be provided no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), two (2) weeks after the request is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to provide by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	The MTFs will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement using a zero to seven rating scale. Zero is equal to ?not acceptable? and seven is equal to ?highly acceptable?. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all products.  Summary ratings for each vendor will be an average of their numerical scorings combined with an adjectival scale of ?highly acceptable?, ?acceptable?, ?minimally acceptable?, and ?not acceptable?.  All clinical criteria are weighted equally. The scale descriptors are: 0 = ?not acceptable? and 7 = ?highly acceptable?.  Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will result in disqualification from further consideration in the standardization process. 
      
2.	 After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to gregory.morrison@med.navy.mil.

Pricing offers must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) two (2) weeks from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). 

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the responses to the following technical criteria from each vendor and determine acceptability.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) For Omni-Directional Weapon Locating (OWL) Radar Date: 12 June 2007 Contact: RDECOM, CERDEC, Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD), Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-RS, William Bruce, email: William.BruceJR@us.army.mil. Synopsis:  Request For Information (RFI) on techniques for the exploitation for the Omni-directional Weapon Locating (OWL) Radar. Description:  The purpose of this announcement is to request white papers for the Omni-directional Weapon Locating (OWL) Radar.  Responses to this RFI will be reviewed by the Government and may result in an invitation to submit proposals against the Broad Agency Announc ement (BAA) for a 4QFY07 award. Award is not guaranteed and the Government does not intend to pay for information received. The goal of the OWL radar is to provide an affordable 360 degree radar capable of addressing objective requirements for indirect weapon location, location of weapons fired from non-standard platforms and with non-standard trajectories, location of weapons fired from mountainous terrain from elevation both above and below that of the radar system, capable of providing high quality track data on cannon, rocket and mortar targets, capable of providing a cue for handoff to fire control systems, and capable of p roviding quality impact point prediction with sufficient warning to improve force protection and take responsive measures in a timely manner. The radar system shall be designed to allow for future growth potential, to allow for incorporation of additional mission scenarios and new requirements.  The radar must be both transportable and mobile to support early entry forces and forces in contingen t theaters.  Quick system setup and tear down time are essential for quick deployment. REQUIREMENTS: The following are key requirements desired from the OWL radar system.  While an ideal solution would be capable of meeting all requirements from a single radar system, the government will consider looking at alternative approaches which meet a significant portion of the requirements from a single radar system, and which are capable of meeting the full requirement through the use of alternate innovative methods, including use of multiple apertures, multiple frequencies, external intelligence, etc. The OWL radar system should be interoperable with other sensors by cuing and accepting cues and reporting target data into common Army Command, Control and Communications (C3) constructs like Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), Forward Area Air Defense command and Control (FAAD C2) and Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS).

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of File, Folder, Pressboard to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>Proposed addition of File, Folder, Pressboard to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.

This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of pressboard file folders by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Folder, File, Pressboard, Green, Letter, 2 Prong, 25/BX
7530-00-NIB-0822

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY. 
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Pressboard File Folders to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  A similar product is:

SMD2K403 ? Folder, 1/3 Letter, 1 IN, Pressboard

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing pressboard file folders to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than July 11, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>Towed Array Production and Conversion
<DESC>This notice supersedes the previously published FEDBIZOPS notice of 30 April 2007 for Twin Line Arrays. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command in support of Naval Sea Systems Command, Program Executive Office Littoral & Mine Warfare (PEO LMW), Maritime Surveillance Systems (MSS) Program Office PMS 485 and other Navy activities requires additional TB-29A and TL-29A arrays (and related engineering services) in order to support the surveillance and submarine fleets in achieving their missions and intends to procure those materials and services.  The effort would include:  New procurement of up to five TL-29A arrays  New procurement of up to two TB-29A arrays  Conversion (and subsequent integration testing) of up to six submarine TB-29A arrays into three TL-29A arrays  Engineering support services  Provisioned Items Orders (PIOs) for TL-29A. The proposed acquisition would specifically provide for:  One new TL-29A array in FY08 with an option for one new TL-29A array or a potential conversion (vice a new array).  An FY 08 option for two TB-29A arrays for the submarine community. FY09  FY11 would be option years which include one array conversion in each year with an option in FY09 and FY11 for three new TL-29A production arrays, one in FY09 and two in FY11 for foreign programs. There may also be a requirement during FY08  FY11 for an unknown quantity of PIO items and for engineering services to complete conversion work and negligible repair efforts. The Government believes that Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors of Syracuse, NY with their previous requisite knowledge and technical expertise is the only contractor capable of fulfilling these requirements in a timely manner.  While another contractor was previously certified to build the TB-29A array, they have not maintained that capability over the past four years and would need to be recertified.  Lockheed Martin is the only contractor currently certified to build unique Twinline modules, to build TB29A modules and, to conduct TB-29A and TL-29A integration and factory acceptance testing.  Lockheed Martin of Syracuse, NY is the only contractor that can accomplish these requirements without substantial duplication of cost and without unacceptable delays including those attributed to contractor certification. It is anticipated this contract will be awarded in December 2007.  The value of this contract is expected to be approximately $76,800,000.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 334511.  Please see Numbered Note 22. Response to this announcement should be addressed to Pamela Rose at pamela.rose@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>Y--GENERAL CONSTRUCTION BPA
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and not a solicitation.  Please note that a solicitation for this effort does not exist and should not be requested.  A Pre-solicitation Synopsis will not be issued. NASA/George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) intends to enter into one or more General Construction Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) under which the Government may award individual orders with a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) not to exceed $25,000.  Historical data indicates the average FFP per order under the existing General Construction BPA's is approximately $3,900.  Orders that may be placed under the proposed BPA's will generally require the BPA holder to furnish all management, labor, equipment and/or materials necessary for the performance of minor construction, modification, repair and/or rehabilitation of facilities at MSFC or facilities for which MSFC is responsible.  Specific work requirements will be included in the individual orders.  The anticipated period of performance for the BPA's is five years.  MSFC reserves the right to award as many or as few BPAs as it deems is in the best interest of the Government. Payment for orders will be made via Government Credit Card.  Authorized Government credit cardholders may solicit oral or written price quotes for proposed orders from BPA holders and orders may be awarded to the BPA holder whose quote is deemed to be the most advantageous to the Government.  Oral or written quotes may be solicited from BPA holders utilizing competitive or noncompetitive procurement procedures.  There is no guarantee that an order will be placed under any BPA.	The Government may solicit quotes from and place orders with firms who are not a BPA holder since the Government is not required to utilize any BPA to satisfy its general construction requirements.   In order to be considered for award, firms must have an established credit card account, comply with MSFC Credit Card Program procedures, have a valid Duns Number and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database. In addition, firms must submit their capabilities and qualifications in writing demonstrating dependability, ability to provide quality supplies or services at consistently low prices, and as well as their capability to perform numerous purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.  This information must be received by the point of contact below no later than 3:30 P.M., Central Daylight Savings Time, on June 20, 2007.   NASA, George C.

<SUBJECT>99 -- VERY LIGHT JET (VLJ) CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (CRFI) PHASE II
<DESC>VERY LIGHT JET (VLJ) CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (CRFI) Phase II

1.The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capabilities Integration Directorate, ASC/XR, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is submitting an updated Capability Request for Information (CRFI), originally issued 30 Jan 06.  In the initial notice, the Air Force requested information to help examine potential capabilities and military uses of the emerging aircraft class called Very Light Jet (VLJ).  This class is generally defined by a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) no greater than 10,000 lb, powered by one or two gas turbine engines, and a commercial list price less than $5M per aircraft.
Responses to the original notification were received and assessed during March 2006, including the potential to conduct flight evaluations of offered aircraft.  The result of this assessment was that, while these aircraft offer some potential military capabilities at an attractive cost, none of them had been FAA certified at the time.  Therefore, the Air Force elected to suspend further investigations until the FAA certified more than one aircraft.  As indicated in de-briefing sessions with the original CRFI responders, the Air Force has monitored the certification progress of these aircraft and now understands more than one has been certified by the FAA.  Consequently, the Air Force is hereby re-opening discussions with industry to examine potential VLJ capabilities and military uses.  Additionally, as contemplated in the original CRFI, the Air Force is seeking to conduct flight evaluations of FAA certified aircraft in order to better understand their capabilities. 
This is a two part CRFI:  Part A requests information on how emerging commercial opportunities in the VLJ class might have military applications for new mission areas or replace existing mission capabilities, such as sensor platforms, communications relays, network gateways, unmanned platforms, etc. and how these aircraft might be adapted to fulfill those roles.  Part B requests updated capability information on FAA certified VLJ aircraft and their availability for qualitative flight evaluations by Air Force test pilots.
The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.  This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this advertisement.  This is a request for information/market research announcement for planning purposes.  The Government will not reimburse costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Although the word ?proposed? may be used in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.
Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry.  This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation.  It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.

2. This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the ?art of the possible? from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for the possible uses of the VLJ aircraft class within the military.  Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such.  Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that ?publicly-releasable? and ?proprietary? information are clearly distinguished.  Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.

3. Part A: The Air Force is requesting information from appropriate companies or parties interested in providing novel uses of VLJ aircraft and approaches for adapting them to unique military missions.  We recognize that the VLJ business segment is for the most part commercially driven; thus, in addition to information from VLJ Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), the Air Force is also seeking innovative modification and/or partnering approaches from traditionally defense-focused companies.  We are interested in innovative uses of VLJs where this class aircraft could provide either unique capabilities or an attractive performance/cost benefit to the Air Force.  The following are examples of missions which the VLJ class may be suited to perform: passenger/cargo transport, training, Homeland Defense, signals intelligence (SIGINT), surveillance, reconnaissance, communications relay, airborne communications gateway, and electronic combat.  Industry responses should rank order the missions their proposed VLJ variant may be best suited to perform, with strengths and weaknesses of each mission discussed in three pages or less per mission.  As this is not an exhaustive list, the Air Force requests identification of any additional missions or innovative or novel uses that industry believes this class of aircraft could perform.  The Air Force also requests information on potential technical and business approaches for modifying/adapting VLJ aircraft (e.g., modifications to add sensors, add additional fuel capacity, provide remote piloting, etc.) to perform these unique or beneficial missions.
Part A should include: (1) a cover page containing identification of the company CAGE code, street address, and business size for NACICS code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical point of contact (POC) and the overall company POC in paragraph 4 above (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company), (2) a summary statement indicating the company?s (or team?s) ability and willingness to make its VLJ available for a qualitative flight evaluation whether at Edwards AFB, CA or an alternate location of a company's choice; (3) a thorough aircraft description, including technical and general data summarized in the table titled Technical & General Vehicle Parameters Summary and descriptive text to provide additional detail; and,(4) a description for each viable mission to include modifications needed to adapt the aircraft to the specific mission or use, and estimates of the costs, schedules, and risks to perform these modifications.  Responses are limited to 25 pages.
Part B: In this part, the Air Force requests current information on the capabilities of proposed VLJ aircraft and the responder?s interest in supporting limited qualitative evaluations (qual evals) of that aircraft.  The qual evals will be conducted by fully qualified Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) test pilots and are intended to assist the Air Force in examining potential military missions that this class of aircraft may be suited to perform.  The Air Force desires to perform these qual evals at either Edwards AFB, CA or at a location of the interested party?s selection.  The qual evals are being used to investigate aircraft characteristics and will not require any permanent modification or change to the aircraft.
If you respond to Part B, your responses should include (in addition to your Part A response): (1) identification of cost, personnel, and risk of loss considerations associated with qual eval flights that need to be addressed by the parties prior to conducting qual eval flights; and, (2) the respondents? preferred business approach and methodology for conducting qual evals. Responses are limited to 25 pages.

4.  Broad industry participation in this VLJ Phase II CRFI is encouraged and information on VLJ aircraft that have not yet achieved FAA certification is acceptable.  Companies/teams planning to provide a capability response should identify, to the Air Force point of contact (POC) named below, the name of their company, address, telephone number, and name and position of the individual to contact for future dialogue.

5.  Technical parameters, likely concepts-of-operation, mission performance assessment results, and price will all be considered during this AF VLJ capability assessment.  Upon the conclusion of our effort, participants will be provided a summary of the Air Force assessment of their respective aircraft/approach.

6.  Companies are not limited to a single aircraft configuration for this RFI; however, each VLJ aircraft configuration must be clearly identified in a separate narrative summary.  Request that the narrative summaries discuss specific aircraft information delineated above.  Submissions are requested within 45 days of this announcement and may be made by e-mail or mailing your response on a compact disk to: Mr. Terry Hudson, (937) 255-5763, Contract Negotiator Terry.Hudson@wpafb.af.mil, ASC/577AESG/PK (Bldg 28, Rm. 219, 2145 Monahan Way) Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7017 with a notice of delivery to: Mrs. Pat Krabacher,(937) 904-4501, Contracting Officer patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil, ASC/XRS (Capability Planning Div, 2275 D St., Bldg 16, RM 0053) Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7217.  Personnel hand-carrying responses should contact the Contract Negotiator to arrange a mutually acceptable arrival time.

7.  U.S. and non-U.S. firms are permitted to respond to this VLJ capability RFI.  Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on PIXS/FBO, unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a Company or that Company?s response.  Post submittal one-on-one information sessions with respondents are not contemplated.  They may be offered to responders to clarify understanding of their submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss their business approach to the qual evals.  Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after the CRFI assessments are completed.

8.  Further AF interest in VLJ will be dependent on the results of this VLJ Phase II CRFI capability assessment (including mission performance assessments) and Air Force operational requirements analyses and determinations.  Future purchasing or leasing agreements may be sought to obtain aircraft in order to temporarily or permanently modify them with mission and/or instrumentation equipment for more extensive evaluation.  These additional comprehensive evaluations would be contingent on the Air Force determining there are viable operational missions for the VLJ.  This effort would entail initiating an acquisition program to acquire that new capability via a separate announcement on FBO.

9.  Technical point of contact is Mr. Patrick Fillingim, ASC/XRS Bldg 16, (937) 904-4417, or Mr. Eric Crawford, ASC/XRC Bldg 28, (937) 255-2649.  This notice may be updated as additional information becomes available.  Please check the FBO site for updates to this Phase II announcement under Very Light Jets (VLJ) Capability Request for Information (CRFI) and register to receive e-mail notices of any updates to the FBO announcement.  For more information on "VERY LIGHT JET (VLJ) CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)", please contact the AF POCs using e-mail to all four POCs listed below.

Access to the conservation easement described in Exhibit A will be from the north 50 feet of the west 50 feet of the said W1/2 of the NE1/4.

NOTE:  ACCESS MUST BE FROM A PUBLIC ROAD TO THE EASEMENT AREA.

NOTE:  The access needs to be a defined area such as is written above, in this case an area 50 feet square.  The area should take into account the road right-of-way width as well as encompass a small part of the easement area.  If the right-of-way is 33 feet in width the 50 foot by 50 foot access easement will overlap the WRP area by 27 feet.  Similarly if the road right-of-way is 50 feet wide on each side of the center line an area 75 feet by 75 feet would be sufficient.

NOTE:  If there is no access from a public road, the NRCS state office will work with the landowner to acquire the necessary access easement.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

 (End of provision) 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:                                                    Commandant (G-A)

<DESC>Scope of Work

Real Property and Market-Specific Information

Background
The General Services Administration (GSA) is the Federal agency responsible for furnishing office, warehouse, parking, and unique space for Federal agencies.  Space within GSA owned or controlled facilities is assigned to other Federal agencies, which become GSA?s tenants.  GSA recovers its acquisition, investment and operating costs by charging tenant agencies a commercially-based rent.  GSA?s acquisition of space is also market driven and verification of that market is essential.

?	GSA obtains retrospective fair annual rent appraisals to evaluate rent rates that have been charged to tenants in owned Federal buildings.  
?	GSA obtains building valuation appraisals that support management decision for real property asset investments.  
?	GSA needs real property market information to determine acquisition and investment strategies for owned and the correct lease rates in the affected market when GSA rents from Private Sector Landlords.  
?	Credible data support of these requirements is needed, as the clients and stakeholders have a high scrutiny level for real property investments and the rates charged in both owned and leased real property.   


General Specifications

GSA?s Offices of Real Property Asset Management and National Customer Services Management along with the regional counterparts are in need of internet-based computer accessible informational services.  The information need is real property and market-specific: 

?	a comprehensive market building inventory, trends, and analytics, market and submarket statistics and boundary maps; 
?	a variety of interactive custom and demographic reports as well as quarterly major market overview reports of building vacancy and absorption by market and submarket; 
?	confirmed comparable sales transaction, comparable rental rates and lease expirations sortable by property type, property class, geographic location, dates of sale, building size, and a variety of other data fields;
?	Mapping and aerial photographs of buildings and comparable data;
?	building specific data including floor plate information, building photographs, and  tenant floor-by-floor information;
?	and historic trend analytics including rent, vacancy and absorption.

GSA requires a broad geographic informational base with: 

?	on-site system training, telephone and computer-based technical support with 24 hour 7 days a week access;  
?	the ability for the contractor to provide research on specific real property to include current and historical building specific rent rates, vacancy and major improvements;
?	the information be available nationally for the national offices and market specific within the GSA regions;  
?	and information directly accessible by GSA?s employee or its contractor.  

GSA users are of three geographic areas.  

?	National Users ? GSA Central Office requires full access to the information described above for the full geographic markets available in the United States and its territories.  There may also be a limited number of users in a regional office that will require full national access.

?	Regional Users -- GSA is divided into eleven regions of the United States and its territories. (See Map at web site below)  Most of these regions have at least one major market and their uses may be adjusted to specific markets within that region. The users would require access to their entire region.  

http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/channelView.do?pageTypeId=8195&channelPage=%252Fep%252Fchannel%252FgsaOverview.jsp&channelId=-12920


?	Metropolis Users ? GSA has regional users that are only interested in a particular metropolitan market.  As an example, the San Francisco Bay area or the New York metropolitan area. 

?	As use of real property information expands, the number of users may correspondingly expand.  At any time during the contract period users may be added or subtracted.  For any user added during a contract period, the cost of the user will be an annual cost for a twelve month duration.  If the service is continued in the following year, the cost again will be an annual cost for a twelve month duration.  If the balance of the contract is less than one year in the final year, the annual cost will be prorated by the number of months remaining.  The spreadsheet pricing is cumulative, with the expectation of economies of scale.   The pricing is a fixed amount for a particular grouping of users (i.e., 1-10 users).  As a new user reaches a higher grouping of users (i.e., the 11th user), the pricing would be the amount for that grid of users (i.e., 11-20).   


Either Central Office or the regions may add or subtract users under this contract.  GSA is under no obligation to renew users.

The Contractor is responsible for tracking users.  A monthly report with the number and type of user, and the duration of service shall be sent to the Contracting Officer.  

Solicitation Notes:

GSA reserves the right to make one or more awards from this solicitation.

The due date for proposals is COB July 2, 2007.  

Questions will be entertained until COB June 21, 2007.  Proposers are requested to use the spreadsheet discussed at the Users section of the above SOW. A Microsoft Word version of the SOW may be requested. Questions and requests for the spreadsheet or Word version of the SOW must be sent via e-mail to:  Steven.Cox@GSA.Gov

MILES PER GALLON (MPG)

* NOTE 1 - Contractor shall submit mileage for each route. The mileage of each route multiplied by the number of trips completed, divided by the MPG, will determine the quantity of fuel subject to any EPA. The US Department of Energy field index for the Central Atlantic Region will be utilized in calculating an EPA. The website is: http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gasdiesel .asp   The prevailing fuel index on the date of award shall be the initial index.  EPAs will be calculated and processed quarterly, with the prevailing fuel index at the end of the quarter being used to calculate the index at the beginning of the subject quarter. The calculation could result in increases or decreases in the price adjustment for fuel.  OPM will compensate the contractor for any calculated increases in fuel costs and the contractor would either, at OPMs discretion, pay OPM or issue a credit to OPM for any decreases in fuel costs. The Contracting Officer will make the final determination of which method of consideration the contractor will provide OPM for decreased fuel adjustments.

FUEL:     DIESEL/GASOLINE

* NOTE 2 - The contractor must indicate what fuel will be used under the contract.

* NOTE 3 - USE Pricing Tables Attachment B
 
3.     PRODUCT DESCRIPTION (Boyers/Ft. Meade):
            
For CLIN 0001-0002, CLIN 1001-1002, AND CLIN 2001-2002, the contractor will pickup and deliver to each location (Boyers PA and Ft Meade MD facilities) DAILY (business days). The contractor shall accomplish deliveries within the confines of the normal working hours of these facilities. Also see ATTACHMENT A TIME TABLES 1 & 2 for pick and drop off times.  The contractor will use its discretion on the best feasible primary routes between facilities for on time deliveries and pickups. THE CONTRACTOR MUST SUBMIT IN THEIR PROPOSAL HOW MANY VEHICLES WILL BE USED UNDER THE BOYERS/FT MEADE SERVICE ALONG WITH THE PRIMARY ROUTES BEING USED UNDER THIS PRODUCT DESCRIPTION. THE PRIMARY ROUTES WILL BE SUBJECT FOR APPROVAL BY OPM OFFICIALS.

In the near future, the possibility for other facility delivers within a 2-mile radius of Ft. Meade MD area could be required.  At this time, OPM is unable to identify the facility but will notify the contractor of the changing requirements.  OPM would negotiate a new CLIN, if and when, it is determined the additional route will be needed.

The usual freight between FISD Ft. Meade and Boyers would be approx. (35) footlocker type trunks which are roughly (3) cubic feet each, locked, weighing approx. (40) pounds, but could be as much as (100) pounds each. The contents of the locker type trucks would consist of case material, paper, magnetic tape, equipment, etc. Some freight from the FISD may also be in sealed boxes. It is anticipated that most cargo will be in lockboxes and the use of equipment to load and unload will not be necessary. If cargo may be too oversized/overweight, the contractor will be notified by the COR, in advance, so that the proper equipment will be utilized. All equipment used for oversized/ overweight freight will be provided for the contractor at each OPM facility. Furthermore, changes due to technology may have an impact on the number of lockboxes or sealed boxes being shipped between OPM facilities in the near future.  OPM may seek an equable adjustment for reduction in material. The contractor shall have A DEDICATED VEHICLE (s) for these deliveries and shall not pickup/drop off other agencies or companies material while possessing and/or delivering OPM material.

4.     PRODUCT DESCRIPTION (Ft Meade/Washington DC):
     
For CLIN 0003, 1003, and 2003 these CLINS will be UPON REQUEST ONLY SERVICE ordered via task order. The COR identified in the contract will notify the contractor of the request in advance. If OPM needs deliveries made on demand OPM will notify the contractor, in which OPM has sole discretion on the starting point. The contractor shall accomplish deliveries within the confines of the normal working hours of these facilities. The contractor will use its discretion on the best feasible routes between facilities for on time deliveries and pickups. The contractor must submit in their proposal how many vehicles will be used under the Ft. Meade/DC service along with the primary routes being used for this product description. In addition, when UPON REQUEST SERVICE is requested, there must be sufficient vehicles used for that day to complete both Ft Meade/Boyers and Ft Meade/DC runs.

It is not known at this time what the anticipated amount of freight will be delivered between Ft. Meade/DC. The contractor will be notified in advance of the approximate number of sealed boxes or lockboxes. It is anticipated that most cargo will be in lockboxes and the use of equipment to load and unload will not be necessary. If cargo may be too oversized/ overweight, the contractor will be notified by the COR, in advance, so that the proper equipment will be utilized.     All equipment used for oversized/overweight freight will be provided for the contractor at each OPM facility. The contractor shall not pickup/drop off other agencies or companies material while possessing OPM material. The contractor will invoice for these CLINS via task order.

Question & Answer
06/12/2007

Question 1:  Since this contract is for part 91 flying and there was no mention of any limitation, I assume there is no age limit that will be imposed on contract pilots, correct?

Answer 1: There is no age limit for our operation.  As long as a pilot has an ATP, is typed 	in the equipment to be flown, has a current first or second class medical, and has been to a recurrent course in the past 12 months he is good to go.  Landings within the last 90 days are not a concern to us; we will accommodate that requirement if necessary.

OPM-3  Announcement of Contract Award	[FAR 5.3]

OPM complies with FAR 5.3, Synopses of Contract Awards, in terms of synopsizing and publicly announcing contract awards. These actions take place at the time of, and not before, the contract is awarded. Contract award, in this case, means signature of the contractual document by the Contracting Officer and forwarding of the contractual document to the contract awardee. If the contract awardee wishes to make a separate public announcement, the awardee must obtain the approval of the Contracting Officer prior to releasing the announcement, and must plan to make announcement only after the contract has been awarded.

       (b)       Key Personnel

              (1)       In order to ensure a smooth and orderly start up of work, it is essential that the key personnel specified in the Contractor's proposal be available on the effective date of the contract.

If the Contractor does not show cause, the Contractor may be subject to default action.
              (2)       The Contractor shall not of its own will remove or replace any personnel designated as "key" personnel without the written concurrence of the cognizant Contracting Officer.     Prior to utilizing employees other than specified personnel, the Contractor shall notify the Government Contracting Officer and the COR. This notification must be no later than five (5) calendar days in advance of any proposed substitution and must include justification (including resume(s) of proposed substitution(s)) in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the impact on contract performance.
              (3)       Substitute personnel qualifications must be equal to, or greater than, those of the personnel being substituted. If the Government Contracting Officer and the COR determine that the proposed substitute personnel is unacceptable, or that the reduction of effort would be so substantial as to impair the successful performance of the work under the contract, the Contractor may be subject to default action.  If deemed necessary by the Government, substitute personnel must be given a one-(1) day orientation by Contractor personnel at no additional cost to the Government and with no change in the delivery schedule.
              (4)       In the event that the performance of assigned Contractor personnel or any substitute(s) is determined by the Government to be unsatisfactory at any time during the life of the Contract, the Government reserves the right to request and receive satisfactory personnel replacement within five (5) calendar days of receipt by the Contractor of written notification.
Notification will include the reason for requesting replacement personnel.
              (5)       The Contractor-supplied personnel are employees of the Contractor and under the administrative control and supervision of the Contractor. The Contractor, through its personnel, shall perform the tasks prescribed herein. The Contractor must select, supervise, and exercise control and direction over its employees (including subcontractors) under this Contract. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the Contractor in its performance of contractual services under this contract. The Contractor is accountable to the Government for the action of its personnel.
              (6)       The Contractor is herewith notified that employee recruiting and employee retention practices shall be monitored on a regular basis.

       (c)       Qualifications of Employees

       The Contracting Officer may require dismissal from work of those employees which he/she deems incompetent, careless, insubordinate, unsuitable or otherwise objectionable, or whose continued employment he/she deems contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national security. The Contractor must fill out, and cause each of its employees on the contract work to fill out, for submission to the Government, such forms as may be necessary for security or other reasons. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor's employees must be fingerprinted. Each employee of the Contractor who works on this contract shall be a citizen of the United States of America, or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence as evidenced by Alien Registration Receipt Card Form 1-151, or who presents other evidence from the Immigration and Naturalization Service that employment will not affect his/her immigration status.

       (d)       Standards of Conduct

       Personnel assigned by the contractor to the performance of work under this order must be acceptable to the Government in terms of personal and professional conduct. Contractor personnel shall conform to standards of conduct as follows:

       (1)       No contractor employees shall solicit new business while performing work under this order.

       (2)       The contractor and its employees shall not discuss with unauthorized persons any information obtained in the performance of work under this order.

       Should the continued assignment to work under this order of any person in the contractor s organization be deemed by the Contracting Officer to conflict with the interests of the Government, that person shall be removed immediately from assignment, and the reason for removal shall be fully documented in writing by the Contracting Officer. Employment and staffing difficulties shall not be justification for failure to meet established schedules, and if such difficulties impair performance, the contractor may be subject to default.

       (e)       Contractor Report of Separated Staff

       The contractor shall notify the Government by the fifth day of each month, for the prior 60 day period, of any staff with access to the Office of Personnel Management s information systems that for any reason (separation, reassignment, etc.) are no longer performing services under the contract. This also applies to new employees. Such notification shall take place using the attached form and shall be sent to the Contracting Officer s Representative, contract administrator and systemaccesscontrol@opm.gov on a monthly basis. Negative reports (no change in contractor staff) are required. Failure to submit this monthly report will result in the suspensions of all User IDs associated with this contract.


OPM-5 Organizational Conflicts of Interest	[FAR 9.5]

       (a)       The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor s knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest (OCI), as defined in FAR 9.5, Organizational and Consultants Conflicts of Interest, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information.

       (b)       The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential OCI is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure must include a description of actions, which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict.

       (c)       The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contacting Office, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

       (d)       The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer.

       (e)       In the event that a requirement changes in such a way as to create a potential conflict of interest for the Contractor, the Contractor must:
       (1)       Notify the Contracting Officer of a potential conflict, and;
       (2)       Recommend to the Government an alternate approach which would avoid the potential conflict, or
              (3)       Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will:
                     (i)       Describe in detail the changed requirement that creates the potential conflict of interest; and
                     (ii)       Outline in detail the actions to be taken by the Contractor or the Government in the performance of the task to mitigate the conflict, division of subcontractor effort, and limited access to information, or other acceptable means.
       (4)       The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.
       (5)       If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to proceed with work, notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver must be submitted in accordance with FAR 9.503.


OPM-6  SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING PLAN	[FAR 19.7]

       (A)       IF YOUR COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO FILE A SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTYRACTING PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 52.219-9, PLEASE USE THE SUBCONTRACTING PLAN TEMPLATE ATTACHED TO THIS SOLICITATION FOR THAT PURPOSE.

       (b)       The on-line Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) must now be used for input of the reports required by FAR 52.219-9(d)(10)(iii). To comply with this requirement, please do the following:

              (1)       If your company does not yet have an eSRS account, then please sign up for one at www.esrs.gov. A user guide that explains how to use eSRS is available at: http://esrs.gov/documents/esrs_contractor_user_guide_1.7.pdf. If you notice that your company contact information or DUNS number in eSRS are not correct, then please make corrections through the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website at http://www.ccr.gov/. That data will then flow from the CCR to the Federal Procurement Data System  Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and then finally into the eSRS system. Repopulation of your eSRS contact info can take two business days after you make corrections in the CCR. Please include the e-mail addresses of the contracting officer in eSRS for notification in block 13 of the report.

              (2)       Starting with fiscal year 2004, submit your Summary Subcontracting Reports (SSRs  Old SF 295) and your Individual Subcontracting Reports (ISRs  Old SF 294) for contracts into the eSRS. Midyear reports are not required in eSRS for FY 2004 and 2005.

              (3)       For fiscal year 2006 onward also submit your midyear (March) ISRs into eSRS.

              (4)       If you have not yet submitted a final report for any contracts closed during FY 2004 onward, you should do so now using the eSRS.

              (5)       Please continue to submit to the Contracting Officer paper prints of all the reports you input to eSRS, until further notice. (This continues to be a FAR requirement)

              (6)       If you have a Contract (BPA) with OPM, please submit your ISRs via paper. FPDS-NG, which provides data into eSRS, does not identify subcontracting plans resulting from BPAs and other types of orders.

<DESC>A revised Statement of Work has been posted on the DOC homepage http://sill-www.army.mil/doc/ All references to the 4th Floor of Building 4700 are deleted.Change marks to the Statement of Work are in the left hand margin.Contractors must acknowledge this modification when submitting a bid response.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS(SET III)Solicitation W9124L-07-T-0053DOL/DFAS ST. LOUIS FURNITURE MOVE1.Question:Contractor shall provide poles and one (1) cubicle pigtail per six (6) work stations.  Unicor will not s ell to us as they only sell to the Federal Government. Therefore, we can wire the work stations per this plan using existing poles and pigtails found in St Louis, but the Government will have to procure any shortfalls. Can I disregard the wording which imp lies we are to provide poles and pigtails, and focus instead on the Government's desire that the wiring be 1 per 6 stations? Answer:Contractors may not disregard the wording which states that contractors are to provide poles and pigtails.  Contractor shall  wire the work stations per this plan using existing poles and pigtails found in St. Louis.  The Government expects wiring to be one per six workstations.  Contractor will provide what is available at the current location in St. Louis.  Unicor sells to the  Federal Government only.  The Government will address shortfalls as a separate issue. 2.Question:Move to location is bulding 4700, Mow-Wat St., Fort Sill, OK 73503, 3rd and 4th and 1st floors.  I have only received drawings for the basement, 1st and 3rd f loors. I understand I am to disregard the basement, so I am looking for the 4th floor drawing. I cannot accurately assess what is to be installed without the 4th floor drawing. I would be guessing, which could lead to an apples to oranges bidding situation . What do you advise, so that the bidding playing field be level for all offerors? Answer:Location of Building 4700 is on Mow Way St., Fort Sill, OK.  The 4th Floor requirement has been deleted by Amendment 5. 3.Question:The Government expects 8x10 and 10x 10 configurations for the 3rd and 4th floors. 7x10 and 6x8 configurations are expected for the 1st floor. The vast majority of product available in St Louis are in 3 foot increments which is to say the 8x10s will wind up being 9x9s and the 10x10s will be 9x12s; otherwise, you will wind up with too many excess 36 inch corners and too few 3624 rectangles. To ach ieve maximum number of stations using existing product, we recommend 9x9s and 9x12s. Is this acceptable to the Government? Answer:The 4th Floor requirement is deleted by Amendment 5.  Contractor may include the 9x9 and 9x12 configurations with proposal.  C ontractors are encouraged to submit a Design Plan Layout with their proposal.  The Government will evaluate each proposal in accordance with Best Value determination factors.4.Question:All baseboard electrical connected between cubicles... The contractor w ill pull the cable set .... The contractor will label each faceplate...We understand our only responsibility here is to wire the electrical to the stations as noted, but that DOIM will be be handling all the voice and data requirements. Is this accurate? Answer:	Yes.
