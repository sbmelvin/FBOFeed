<DESC>This notice serves as a pre-solicitation notice for the full rate production procurement of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) for Lots 13, 14, and associated sustainment efforts (FY15 - FY16). The Armament Directorate intends to award a sole source contract for Production and Sustainment to include operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness for the JASSM and the JASSM-ER for Lot 13, with a priced option for Lot 14. This acquisition is contemplated as sole source under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements (10 USC 2304(c)(1)), to Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control-Orlando, 5600 Sand Lake Road, Orlando, FL, 32819-8907. Subcontracting opportunities should be addressed to the Subcontracts Manager (Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control-Orlando) at phone 407-356-9246. Specific production and sustainment requirements may include, but are not limited to: JASSM/JASSM-ER missile production activities which include USAF missiles and missile variants authorized for release to Foreign Military Sales (FMS). In addition to the JASSM-ER missile hardware and software, this weapon system includes telemetry instrumentation kits, precision targeting image software, the JASSM Weapon System Simulator, technical data, obsolescence management, upgrades, production implementation, pre-planned product improvement, sustainment, aircraft integration, non-warranty repair, containers, and other related items. Support items include, but are not limited to, replacement parts, program management, engineering, logistics, test support, support equipment, software/hardware upgrades to support production missiles, associated data, and any other supplies or services needed to sustain the program over the life of the system, as well as all facilities, equipment, labor, tools and test equipment necessary to produce an estimated 140 JASSM missiles and 100 JASSM-ER missiles for Lot 13; and 215 JASSM-ER missiles for Lot 14. Deliveries for each Lot are anticipated to begin approximately 18 months after contract award. Sustainment activities include JASSM/JASSM-ER system repair, container requirements, and repairable/replaceable components of these end items plus the repair infrastructure; and any other supplies or services needed to sustain the JASSM/JASSM-ER program over the life of the system. Repair infrastructure includes program management, replacement parts, special tooling maintenance, business management, hardware demilitarization/disposal and administrative support. Sustainment requirements are anticipated to include the repair capability for the estimated quantities listed above that cover non-warranted missiles and other support items. The fulfillment of the supplies/services listed above requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for manufacture and production. As Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control's obligations under existing contracts continue, any Government-owned peculiar equipment will not be available to any second source. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the Government. Any capability statement will need to demonstrate how the source can provide a qualified JASSM/JASSM-ER within the required timeframes and without substantial duplication of costs. No technical data package is available. The date of response to this synopsis for the JASSM/JASSM-ER Production &amp; Sustainment Program is fifteen (15) days after the date of this synopsis publication.

Loper, Contracting Officer at AFLCMC/EBJK, 205 West D. Avenue, Suite 632, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6807 at (850) 883-3080 or e-mail cheryl.loper@us.af.mil. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, Michigan intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sierra Instruments to  re-commission and upgrade EPA owned Sierra Instruments BG-2 Partial Flow Particulate Sampler to the capabilities of the latest Sierra Instruments BG-3 Particulate Partial Flow Sampling System under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This upgrade to the BG-2 Particulate Partial Flow Sampling System will incorporate any additional requirements to make the functionalities equivalent to the BG-3 Particulate Partial Flow Sampling System.  The upgraded unit must meet 40 Code of Federal Register (CFR) Parts 1065, 86, & 89, as well as ISO 8178 and ISO 16183.  The contractor shall replace the existing obsolete system computer with an industrial grade computer with at least a Pentium 4 processor, 512 MB RAM, hard drive, USB Ports, Read/write CD drive and a 15 inch flat screen monitor with keyboard.    The software shall be upgraded to include full calibration capability and graphing of individual measurements. The upgraded software shall provide for setup of test parameters, calibration of the system and display of parameters in real time.  The Input/Output (I/O) system shall be replaced with new hardware that is compatible with upgraded BG-3 software.  These unique capabilities are essential for performance because the proprietary micro-dilution tunnel is the key piece of technology used in this PM sampler.  Work conducted at EPA shall be performed during normal working hours. Sierra Instruments is the only known source able to re-commission and upgrade current Sierra Instruments equipment.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of re-commissioning and upgrading Sierra Instruments equipment may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  Such documentation must be submitted to the Point of Contact within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Gerold Young II via e-mail at young.gerold@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award limited source Multiple Award Blanket Purchase Agreements. EPA Region 1 New England located at 5 Post Office Sq, Boston, MA  02109 intends to negotiate limited source Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) for Forensics Soils Scientist Expert Support Services for the EPA Region 1 Wetlands Enforcement Office for a period of five (5) years.  Limited sources for this expertise are Wheeler Environmental Service, LLC and Peter Fletcher. Soils forensics is a specialty related to disturbed soils.  It takes years of field experience to be able to accurately document the pre-disturbance state of a soil.  Soils are one of 3 criteria necessary to document the existence of a wetland - hydrology and vegetation are the two others.  In disturbed wetland sites, the vegetation has been removed and the hydrology sometimes altered.  In addition, the upper layers of the soil have either been removed and replaced with fill material, or have been mechanically mixed.  Soils forensics is often what the government relies on in determining whether a disturbed site was a previously a wetland or not.  A solid understanding of the soils in wetlands is key to accurate delineation of post-disturbance wetland mapping and equally important to designing a restoration of the disturbed wetlands.  The sources identified have been involved in supporting several EPA wetlands enforcement cases and have the specialized knowledge to provide the  required forensic soils analyses services. The Government intends to solicit, negotiate and award to these sources using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however all responses received by the response due date will be considered by the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred for preparing a response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Contracting Officer is Patrice Denault, Denault.Patrice@epa.gov . Any responses to this notice shall be submitted to Denault.Patrice@epa.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to Summit Point Raceway Associates, Inc ( quote mark BSR quote mark ).  The purpose is to provide three (3) hands-on training classes for USACE's Dynamics of International Terrorism Class and U.S. Army Individual Terrorism Awareness Course (INTAC).  No competition is being sought.  This action is for a short-term  quote mark bridge quote mark  contract to ensure previously scheduled training classes in February, March and April do not have to be cancelled while a three year INTAC contract is being re-procured.  BSR held the previous INTAC training contract, which expired in December of 2013.  The costs to move the Government's INTAC equipment from BSR's location to another facility far exceeds any savings that might be found by competing this three-month action.   <br>  <br> The anticipated period of performance is from February 5, 2014 through April 18, 2014. <br>  <br> This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.2  quote mark Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions quote mark .  A solicitation will not be posted. <br>  <br> However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within fifteen (15) days of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Please see the sources sought notice, W912HQ-14-S-0001, on FBO for additional information regarding this requirement and the upcoming re-procurement.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends on proceeding with awarding a fixed price contract to BSR for three INTAC training classes.

2.  Contractor/laboratory shall provide acceptable MDL studies for total coliform, fecal, coliform, E. coli, and chlorophyll a.
3. The Contractor/laboratory may not sub contract any analysis out.
4.  In order to receive an award the laboratory must be approved by Mid-Pacific Regions Quality Assurance and Data Management Branch, MP-156.  Approval will include but not be limited to passing a Quality Assurance Audit as stated below, receiving an acceptable review of the laboratorys QA Manual, round-robin performance evaluation samples, and reporting limits.
Audit Process:
The MP-156 quality assurance (QA) section conducts audits on laboratories involved in analytical activities that support Mid-Pacific Region projects.  The audit consists of reviewing the laboratorys QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results, submitting performance evaluation samples, and conducting an onsite audit.  The review process allows the QA section to determine if laboratories are capable of performing quality analyses on Mid-Pacific Region samples while following QA/QC practices that meet or exceed Mid-Pacific Region standards and protocols.
Background Review:
Prior to the audit, the QA section will contact the laboratory QA officer or the laboratory director and request a copy of both the current QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results.  The performance study results and QA manual are reviewed by the QA section.  Performance Evaluation Samples:
Prior to the onsite audit, the QA section conducts a performance audit by submitting performance evaluation samples.  The purpose of the performance evaluation samples is to evaluate the laboratorys ability to generate accurate data.  If the laboratory performs poorly on the performance evaluation samples, the QA section may consider not conducting the onsite audit.  The parameters submitted for the performance evaluation samples will be tailored to reflect those of current Mid-Pacific Region projects and the methods the laboratory performs.  
If the laboratory does not obtain a result within the acceptance criteria, the laboratory will be directed to reanalyze the sample(s).  If the reanalyzed result is within the acceptance criteria, then the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory still does not meet the acceptance criteria upon reanalysis, a new performance evaluation sample from a different lot or vendor will be submitted.  If the laboratory can obtain an acceptable result on the new performance evaluation sample, the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory does not meet the acceptance on the original, reanalysis, or new performance evaluation sample, the laboratory will not be audited or approved for this method/parameter.
Audit Agenda:
Approximately one week prior to the audit, the auditor will send the laboratory contact a proposed audit agenda.  The audit agenda details the time allotted for the initial meeting with management, analytical method review, document review, and debrief.  After laboratory review and approval, the audit agenda will be finalized. 
Onsite Audit:
An onsite laboratory audit is conducted by the QA section to assess the laboratorys expertise in conducting the analyses, the capability for producing valid data, the ability to effectively support the data, and the integrity of the QA/QC practices.  Meet with Management:
The first step of the audit will be to meet with management and key laboratory personnel to discuss the purpose of the audit and give a general overview about the Mid-Pacific Region and the Quality Assurance and Data Management Branch (MP-156).  During this meeting, the audit team will discuss MP-156s policies and requirements, the performance evaluation sample results (if available), document request, and questions for the QA Officer (QAO).   
Analytical Method and Document Review:
During the onsite audit, the QA officer, analysts, and other key laboratory personnel are questioned to determine their overall understanding of the methods and laboratory procedures.  Documentation practices are also reviewed.  In general, the auditors are checking to see if the laboratory procedures follow the laboratorys QA manual guidelines and the EPA method, Standard method, or other method protocols.  Debrief:
The most serious deviations are presented to the laboratory as findings in a debrief meeting at the end of the audit; the debrief is generally conducted the day after the audit.  All the deviations are written as findings or observations in the final audit report.  Audit Report:
Any deviations from accepted protocols are written in an audit report as findings.  The report can also include good practices for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to continue and observations for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to adopt.  Laboratory Audit Response and Final Approval Letter:
The laboratory is asked to send a response to each finding detailed in the QA sections audit report.  The auditors will review this response and assess if the corrective actions and explanations are acceptable.  If any response is questionable, the laboratory is contacted for clarification.
Once the review of the laboratorys audit response is complete, the lead auditor will send a final letter addressing whether or not the laboratory is approved for use. System for Award Management (SAM), as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on SAM registration can be obtained via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov.

2.  Contractor/laboratory shall provide acceptable MDL studies for total coliform, fecal, coliform, E. coli, and chlorophyll a.
3. The Contractor/laboratory may not sub contract any analysis out.
4.  In order to receive an award the laboratory must be approved by Mid-Pacific Regions Quality Assurance and Data Management Branch, MP-156.  Approval will include but not be limited to passing a Quality Assurance Audit as stated below, receiving an acceptable review of the laboratorys QA Manual, round-robin performance evaluation samples, and reporting limits.
Audit Process:
The MP-156 quality assurance (QA) section conducts audits on laboratories involved in analytical activities that support Mid-Pacific Region projects.  The audit consists of reviewing the laboratorys QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results, submitting performance evaluation samples, and conducting an onsite audit.  The review process allows the QA section to determine if laboratories are capable of performing quality analyses on Mid-Pacific Region samples while following QA/QC practices that meet or exceed Mid-Pacific Region standards and protocols.
Background Review:
Prior to the audit, the QA section will contact the laboratory QA officer or the laboratory director and request a copy of both the current QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results.  The performance study results and QA manual are reviewed by the QA section.  Performance Evaluation Samples:
Prior to the onsite audit, the QA section conducts a performance audit by submitting performance evaluation samples.  The purpose of the performance evaluation samples is to evaluate the laboratorys ability to generate accurate data.  If the laboratory performs poorly on the performance evaluation samples, the QA section may consider not conducting the onsite audit.  The parameters submitted for the performance evaluation samples will be tailored to reflect those of current Mid-Pacific Region projects and the methods the laboratory performs.  
If the laboratory does not obtain a result within the acceptance criteria, the laboratory will be directed to reanalyze the sample(s).  If the reanalyzed result is within the acceptance criteria, then the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory still does not meet the acceptance criteria upon reanalysis, a new performance evaluation sample from a different lot or vendor will be submitted.  If the laboratory can obtain an acceptable result on the new performance evaluation sample, the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory does not meet the acceptance on the original, reanalysis, or new performance evaluation sample, the laboratory will not be audited or approved for this method/parameter.
Audit Agenda:
Approximately one week prior to the audit, the auditor will send the laboratory contact a proposed audit agenda.  The audit agenda details the time allotted for the initial meeting with management, analytical method review, document review, and debrief.  After laboratory review and approval, the audit agenda will be finalized. 
Onsite Audit:
An onsite laboratory audit is conducted by the QA section to assess the laboratorys expertise in conducting the analyses, the capability for producing valid data, the ability to effectively support the data, and the integrity of the QA/QC practices.  Meet with Management:
The first step of the audit will be to meet with management and key laboratory personnel to discuss the purpose of the audit and give a general overview about the Mid-Pacific Region and the Quality Assurance and Data Management Branch (MP-156).  During this meeting, the audit team will discuss MP-156s policies and requirements, the performance evaluation sample results (if available), document request, and questions for the QA Officer (QAO).

<DESC>Program Title:  Consolidated Product-line Management Next (CPM Next) <br>  <br> Introduction & Requirement Summary:  The Program Executive Office Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation's (PEO STRI's) Project Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE) Live Training Transformation (LT2) CPM Next approach focuses on the requirements, development, execution, management, and synchronization of the LT2 Product-Line (P/L).  <br>  <br> In 2001, PEO STRI put the LT2 P/L strategy in place. Today, through the use of the current CPM contract, PM TRADE builds and maintains the LT2 P/L systems in support of home station training, deployed training, urban operations training, Maneuver Combat Training Centers (MCTCs) training, and instrumented live-fire range training. The LT2 P/L provides state-of-the-art training systems to the warfighter using over 120 common reusable software components, architectural infrastructure, interfaces, standards, processes, and information technology assets. The LT2 holistic paradigm provides an efficient Army training support system modernization strategy that: <br>  <br> a. provides key enablers for the Army's Live, Virtual, and Constructive domains, and Joint Integrated Training Environment (ITE) <br> b. focuses on effective and current implementation of Information Assurance <br> c. aligns with the DoD Training Transformation vision (i.e. Test & Training, Embedded Training, and Dual Use Equipment)  <br> d. incorporates Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts that facilitate architectural evolution to support DoD Net-centricity and the Army's vision for the Common Operating Environment (COE) <br>  <br> With over 150 systems fielded globally, the LT2 P/L successfully employs technical and acquisition strategies that significantly reduces fielding time, minimize acquisition costs, enables total ownership cost reductions across the live training domain and Live, Virtual, Constructive-Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE), and enhances training benefits afforded to the warfighter. <br>  <br> The CPM Next contract will continue to manage the evolution of the LT2 P/L and provide total life-cycle support to those programs that utilize the LT2 P/L. The CPM Next contract will continue to meet the requirement for a consolidated streamlined approach that protects and leverages the Army's LT2 P/L investment, continues the development and evolution of the LT2 products/systems, core assets, architectural frameworks, and the LT2 P/L Construct, while continuing to provide PM TRADE an efficient, effective, and agile method to accomplish: <br>  <br> a. development, integration, testing, management, maintenance, and evolution of the LT2 P/L (products, systems, Systems of Systems (SoS) capabilities, architectures, processes, and core assets) <br> b. total life-cycle system management and P/L support  <br> c. P/L support of products, systems, and SoS capabilities that leverage LT2 P/L assets <br> d. architectural and system development, and core asset evolution in support of external interoperability initiatives such as LVC-ITE, COE, Joint services initiatives, and Foreign Military Sales as required within the LT2 P/L <br> e. synchronization with other PEO STRI efforts and initiatives as required by the LT2 P/L (such as the Warfighter FOCUS contract) <br>  <br> CPM Next is the contractual framework by which PM TRADE will execute control of a systems life cycle within a SoS environment to maximize the commonality, reuse and interoperability of the system, while maintaining integrity of the product lines from which it is based. CPM Next will continue to evolve the deliberate process for managing the development, production, and sustainment of LT2 products. It enables using organizations to maintain visibility and control of the configuration of those systems, and SoS integration for which they are responsible throughout the total system life cycle.  <br>  <br> The anticipated nature and complexity of the LT2 P/L work tasks (ranging from P/L architectural development, system development, SoS management to P/L core asset variability, and configuration management) associated with the CPM Next requires mature and established processes. <br>   <br> Acquisition Strategy Planning Information: <br>  <br> Draft CPM Next Statement of Works (SOWs):  Four Draft SOWs are provided with this announcement: 1) CPM Next Base SOW, 2) CPM Next Construct SOW, 3) CPM Next CTIA SOW and 4) CPM Next PDSS SOW.   Please utilize these SOWs when developing your responses to this sources sought notice. <br>  <br> Contract Vehicle:  Based upon the current CPM contract approach and successes garnered from that approach (cost avoidances in keeping with Better Buying Power (BBP) initial guidance and BBP 2.0, as an example) the contemplated contract approach is a single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with delivery orders under the IDIQ contract to accomplish the work expected.   The existing CPM contract has had to date 15 delivery orders. <br>    <br> Contract Type:  Delivery order contract types under the CPM Next overarching contract are anticipated to be consistent with the CPM contract - multiple types that provide flexibility and agility to the using program offices that want to garner the benefits of the LT2 processes in place for cost avoidance and conformance to Army live training standards.  CPM historical data of the delivery orders indicates that 91% were Cost Plus Fixed Fee (work type including system development, architecture development, post deployment system support, and integration), 8% Firm Fixed Price (work type including integration, technology insertion, and technology refresh), and 1% Time and Material contract types (work type was services).   <br>  <br> Approximate Funding: The existing CPM contract is a five year $200M single award IDIQ contract.  Funding for the existing CPM contract work comes from the multiple programs that place delivery order work on the CPM contract.  It is anticipated that CPM Next contract will be at the funding level of $250-300M. <br>  <br> Acquisition Time Estimates:  <br>  	Responses to the Sources Sought Information are requested by 21 June 2013 <br>  	Industry Day will be held on 24/25 June 2013 at PEO STRI in Orlando, FL  <br>  	Draft RFP Release 1st quarter FY14 <br>  	RFP Release 2nd quarter FY14  <br>  	Proposals Due 30 days after RFP release <br>  	Contract Award  - TBD <br>  <br> Information Paper Instructions: As a part of Market Research, the Government requests interested contractors provide up to a 10 page summary, inclusive of cover page, that addresses the following topics within the context of the LT2 P/L domain.  <br>  <br> 1)PM TRADE is looking for ideas, strategies and solutions to enable the LT2 P/L to achieve PM TRADE Strategic Business Goals, listed below: <br> a. reduce operational costs and complexity  <br> b. align and support product development (common standards, interfaces, etc) <br> c. enhance soldier training <br> d. reduce sustainment and development costs <br> e. increase technology agility <br> f. leverage other Army systems and Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) technologies <br> g. align to the Army COE, mobile computing, and distributed computing strategies  <br>  <br> 2)Specifically address ideas, strategies, and solutions related to LT2 P/L Consolidated Post Development System Support (PDSS) and Post Production System Support (PPSS).

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) is performing market research to determine available sources that can provide a commercial off the shelf (COTS) theory of constraint (TOC), critical chain and multi-project management software solution. The software will be installed at ALC, Elizabeth City, NC. The contractor shall have the capability to implement and train ALC personnel on the software use and development of new business practices. Prior to implementation of the software, the contractor will be required to analyze ALC business practices and operations in order to recommend business rule and operational changes necessary to implement TOC principles.
<p>The basic steps outlined by TOC, to accomplish these goals:<br />1. Identify the constraint(s)<br />2. Exploit the constraint to maximize productivity<br />3. Subordinate all other steps or processes to the speed or capacity of the constraint<br />4. Elevate the constraint - in other words, work to remove the current constraint, leading to higher capacity or production rate for the entire system</p>
<p>After changes to the business have been implemented, the contractor will implement and train ALC personnel on the software use. The software will enable ALC to manage operations utilizing TOC practices. The software will be utilized for the USCG Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) for Coast Guard Aircraft including the HC-144, HU-25, HH-60 and HH-65 aircraft.</p>
<p>Identified COTS solutions must have the ability to interact with Primavera scheduling software. The software must be able to accept input from multiple projects and display the progress of these projects simultaneously. It must prioritize activities and list the most important activity to work from the multiple projects being managed.</p>
<p>There is a requirement to have 500 touch labor personnel working on 160 aircraft that this software shall be able to accommodate.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be fulfilled utilizing the procedures established in FAR Part 12, Commercial Items, and supplemented by FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures using best value and tradeoffs.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of membership and accreditation with the Acoustical Society of America at the WPAFB 711th Human Performance Wing. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).<br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 813410. Size standard is $7,000,000. <br />The proposed source is The Acoustical Society of America., 35 Pinelawn Rd, Suite 114E, Melville, NY, 11747. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within five (5) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires Acoustical Society of America membership which will be used in laboratory testing and research at the 711th Human Performance Wing. The Government is required to be a member of this organization, as the Air Force must use these standards, for their programs. As the voice of the U.S. standards and conformity assessment system, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) empowers its members and constituents to strengthen the U.S. marketplace position in the global economy while helping to assure the safety and health of consumers and the protection of the environment. The Air Force requires the influence on ANSI standards which affect the methods in which the acoustical performance of everything from earplugs to aircraft are measured. In the US, the only known group that develops these standards is ASA with delegated authority from ANSI. <br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov

<DESC>This notice is a request for information (RFI) and is not a request for proposals (RFP). The government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released. In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. <br>  <br> Description <br>  <br> The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center-Fort Eustis (MICCC-E) is seeking information on approaches and methods that can be used to remotely manage Digital Training Facilities (DTF) for the Product Director Distributed Learning System (PD DLS) located at 11846 Rock Landing Dr, Newport News, VA.  The Army is seeking market research, potential sources, and best practice information to remotely manage 215 DTFs located at 88 geographically separated locations throughout the world. The DTF is a digital class room supporting up to 12 students at Reserve Component locations or up to 16 students at Army Active installations.  The DTFs supports collective (group) training by providing classroom style environments.  DTFs provide networked computers that support digital training, Video Tele-training equipment supporting courseware transmission from remote sites, and servers to interface Army intranets and the internet.  DTFs also provide individual Soldiers with an on-base location to access web-based, job related and professional courses.  The DLS network is centrally managed through an Enterprise Management Center (EMC) located on Fort Eustis, VA.  A Government Distributed Learning Point of Contract (DLPOC) is appointed at each location.  All DTF equipment and furnishings are currently provided by the Government.  Security cameras with remote monitoring capability are installed in each DTF.   <br>  <br> Current Operations: <br>  <br> The DLS currently provides an on-site DTF Manager (DTFM) at each location to support the DTFs.  The DTFM operates the DTF by scheduling user training, controlling access to the facility, inventorying the DTF equipment, and ensuring the facility is maintained in a neat and orderly configuration.  The DTFM provides daily operational checks and reports equipment troubles to the EMC, assists the EMC to validate/correct system and equipment troubles, coordinates on-site support for periodic equipment/facility upgrades, and provides support materials (e.g. printer supplies).  The DTFM validates the credentials (common access card (CAC) and other personal identification) of new users of the DTF, submits a request for a user ID to the EMC, and enters the DTF domain on the user's CAC.  The DTFM also assists new users of DTF equipment to access the DLS network as well as helps the user to locate and navigate on-line training courseware.  The DTFM promotes the capabilities of the DLS and DTF to encourage usage of the facilities by local Army units and personnel.  The DTFM also collects and reports data on facility usage.   <br>  <br> Technical Criteria <br>  <br> The Remote DTF Management (RDTFM) should be able to support seven (7) primary areas and specific information of interest is as follows: <br>  <br> 1.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice of intent is to notify the commercial market of the Government's intent to make an award to Mergent Inc. for renewal of its annual subscription to Mergent Online Global Database Enterprise license. The Internal Revenue Service intends to award a purchase order to Mergent, Inc. for the renewal of Mergent Online Global Database Enterprise license. This requirement will be made on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(C)(ii). The requirement will be fulfilled by the delivery of the software renewal license for a period of performance of one year. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541519, and the size standard is $25.5 million.
<p>This notice of intent to award should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ) or contract. Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary. Responses to the notice of intent to award will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. As such, the Government will not cover any costs for any information or inquiry submitted as a result of this request. Please include the name of the point of contact, e-mail address and telephone number should the Government have questions regarding individual responses. Please note: A SOLICITATION DOES NOT EXIST. Any comments should be provided no later than 2:00 pm EST on January 31, 2014. Inquiries and/or questions may be sent to the attention of Laquisha Levy by e-mail to: laquisha.l.levy@irs.gov. The reference number for this announcement is M-4-M0-24-72-M00-000. If no compelling responses are received, the award for this requirement will be made to Mergent, Inc.<br /><br />Brand Name Justification:<br />In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)- Only one responsible source; or brand name specification. This requirement is being procured under the above mentioned authority as a result of the manufacturer deeming the product/services as proprietary (thus there are no other resellers). This product/service is also considered brandname as there are no other versions of this product/service. The IRS has been using this product/services for a number of years. The product/services have been tested and deemed compatible to the IRS systems and prove beneficial to the agency. It would be less efficient and more costly and timely to use a product/service other than the brand name listed above. It is in the best interest of the government cost and timeliness considered (to avoid disruption of workflow) to maintain this brand name.</p>

<CONTACT>Jason David Martinez, Email jdmarti@sandia.gov
<DESC>Background Information:
Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) has made an initial investment in the research and development of an energy efficient irregular computed tomography (CT) reconstruction algorithm for large-scale datasets using multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). This technology is described in part in various scientific publications. SNL is seeking commercial partners who are interested in investing in the further development of this technology to create a product that could be deployed by the industrial and medical communities. SNL is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

Opportunity Description:
SNL is seeking a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with an industrial partner with proven experience in the design, development, and deployment of non-destructive evaluation software. The objective of this partnership would be the joint development of a GUI-based CT reconstruction program capable of reconstructing up to 4 trillion volumetric pixels in less than 24 hours. Collaborators will work with SNL on the continued development and testing of the CT reconstruction program and will provide a clear path to commercialization/deployment of the technology through refined product design, optimization, and quality assurance. Qualified partners will contribute resources, including funds-in-support to SNL, in which a minimum of $2M would be required, and in-kind support in the form of programming staff and facilities capable of supporting a small GPU-capable heterogeneous and homogeneous computing cluster (2-10 nodes). Qualified partners will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-defined field of use for reasonable compensation as part of a CRADA agreement.

The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840
Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840
The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp
If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the HQ AMC-Level Protest Procedures. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>Term is mandatory for lodging and hotel requirements. 
This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. 
For a proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor. 
All proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel shall provide the following: (1) Valid business insurance certificate. (2) Hotel agreement verified, and countersigned by both parties and the authorized agent of the participating hotel (hotel letterhead). 
(Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable). <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the avilability of appropriated funds which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This document is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.


The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit competitive offers. Interested persons may submit offers, and all eligible offers received prior to January 29, 2014 12:00 PM CST will be considered by the Government.

Only emailed requests received directly from the requester are acceptable. Responses should be sent to bruce.lundvall@va.gov. No telephone responses will be accepted.

Only verified SDVOSB and VOSB firms are eligible to submit an offer or receive an award of a VA contract that is set-aside for SDVOSBs or VOSBs in accordance with VAAR Part 819.

<DESC><div>The purpose of the Governing for Growth in Georgia (G4G) activity is to improve Georgia&rsquo;s economic governance and leadership, particularly in the areas of: (1) weak enforcement of the legal and regulatory framework and its negative impact on small- and medium-sized enterprises; (2) unregulated use of water resources and the resulting threat to the quality and quantity of water available for long-term economic growth and resource-based conflict; and (3) the lack of an energy trading mechanism between Georgia and neighboring countries that severely inhibits new foreign and domestic investment into hydropower production. G4G will strengthen the capacity of Government of Georgia (GOG) institutions to develop, implement, and enforce reforms, and develop the capacity of private sector and civil society actors to engage the GOG on the development, implementation, and enforcement of reforms. Key to the success of G4G will be supporting inclusive and constructive dialogue among government, private sector, and civil society stakeholders.</div>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. <BR> <BR>(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit.

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance.

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may?

(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor?s managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <BR> <BR>(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.

In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.)

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information.

If a request under the Freedom of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision, the offeror concerned shall be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error. <BR> <BR>(a) Any system hardware, software, firmware and/or networked component (voice, video or data) developed, procured, or acquired in support and/or performance of this contract shall be capable of transmitting, receiving, processing, forwarding and storing digital information across system boundaries utilizing system packets that are formatted in accordance with commercial standards of Internet Protocol (IP) version 6 (IPv6) as set forth in the IJSGv6 Profile (KIST Special Publication 500-267) and corresponding declarations of conformance defined in the USGv6 Test Program.

<DESC>This is amendment 0001 - Questions and Answers and change of response date to 1700 EST 27 January 2014. <br>  <br> Question 1. Can you please advise what is meant by '6ft Beaver Tail with Traction Wheel Paths' (specifically the traction wheel paths). <br> Answer 1. The traction wheel paths are in reference to the specifications for the Tag trailer.  The wheel paths are just the two ramps that fold down from the back of the trailer and 'traction' being something other than smooth. <br>  <br> Question 2. Also do you have the ability to unload the tag along trailer off of a transport trailer? <br> Answer 2. Yes. <br>  <br> Question 3. I am not sure what they mean by straight deck rear trunnion or the 4in. relief gooseneck.  Does the trailer require a beavertail on the rear, since they are asking for ladder ramps, or are they talking about the front folding ramps? <br> Answer 3.  Straight deck rear trunnion is in reference to the trailer deck above the rear axles.  This deck is straight or flat, not sloped.  The trailer does not require a rear beaver tail.  The ladder ramps are in reference to the front flip ramps.  The 4 quote mark  relief gooseneck is synonymous with 4 quote mark  gooseneck support; 4 quote mark  diameter gooseneck.

The best estimated quantities (BEQs) are as follows:<br />Basic Period: 15 of each NSN. One of each will be First Articles<br />Option I: 15 of each NSN<br />Option II: 15 of each NSN<br />Option III: 15 of each NSN<br />Option IV: 15 of each NSN<br />First Article units will be required for each NSN. A Product Description (PD) and Statement of Work will be provided as part of the RFP package along with various mandatory data deliverables such as First Article Test Plan and Test Reports. Foreign Companies will not be permitted to participate in the competition.<br />Delivery Requirements will be 535 calendar days after effective date of order for the first article units and 180 calendar days after effective date of order for the first 6 (six) production units with subsequent production unit orders delivering at a rate of 6 units per 30 day period, dependent upon the quantity ordered.<br />FAR Part 15 procedures will be utilized. Offerors shall prepare their proposals in accordance with mandatory, explicit, and detailed instruction contained in the RFP. This acquisition will utilize the tradeoff source selection process wherein a tradeoff between non-cost factors and cost/price is permitted in order for the Government to make a best value award decision. For those offerors whose proposals are found to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past and present performance and cost/price. Past and present performance is considered to be approximately equal to cost/price. The Government will evaluate proposals and make award in accordance with the "Evaluation Basis of Award" provision in the RFP.<br />Interested offerors may notify the POCs listed below for any additional questions. NO TELEPHONE QUESTIONS. Offerors are encouraged to register to receive notification for solicitation and all amendments/revisions and to check FEDBIZOPPS site prior to submission of their proposal. <br />

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:<br /></span></strong><br />Has your end user/customer considered upgrading only the Virtual Address eXtension (VAX) computer systems within the current AFATS stands?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span><br />If the goal of this request is to get away from the VAX computers, it is possible to replace a VAX with a VAX emulator running on a COTS platform while making no changes to the software that runs thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:<br /><br /></span></strong>Replacing the current VAX system with a VAX emulator isn't really an option at this point since we have six AFATS test stands (and eight non-AFATS test stands ) already upgraded using Wonderware\Siemens software. We would like all of the upgraded test stands to remain consistent from a support stand point. Additionally, when these test stands have to be upgraded 20 years down the road it's going to be much easier if all the test stands have the same base design.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:<br /><br /></span></strong>Does the Government intend to have a site visit/site survey?<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:<br /><br /></span></strong>YES. The site visit/site survey will be held some point near the middle of the solicitation phase. </span>

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred for preparing responses to this announcement. Therefore, any costs associated with a response to the

evaluation will proceed to the next lower tier until award can be made with ample competition.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334515 for Electronic Test and Measuring Equipment with a size standard of 500 Employees. Vendors must complete the attached Business Declaration Form and return with quote submittal.
