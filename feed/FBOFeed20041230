Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.”  This synopsis constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) per FAR 6.102; there will be no formal request for proposals (RFP) or other solicitation in regard to this announcement.  Competition is unrestricted.  
A. INTRODUCTION.
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, Autonomous Vehicle Division, acting as the Technical Direction Agent for the Program Manager, Unmanned Undersea Vehicles, PMS403, is soliciting advanced technology proposals for the development of components, subsystems, and systems to provide sonar solutions for high-resolution bottom mine detection and classification for use in unmanned undersea vehicle applications.  A one-step sequence is established for offerors contemplating submission of a proposal under this BAA.
The proposal may be for projects or investigations that can be completed within 20 months of award, or may be for multiyear projects as long as each subsequent phase can be funded as individual options with clearly defined milestones and deliverables.  NUWCDIVNPT strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration previous and current relevant work, and significant relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations.  Project must have a direct relevance to identified military needs relating to military utility or cost reduction potential.  Proposals should indicate potential transition paths to subsequent development or procurement phases.  A technology insertion plan is encouraged and research that holds promise of insertion into Navy UUV mine detection and classification is of primary interest.
B. GOALS. 
Detection and classification of bottom mines in littoral regions is a key requirement for future naval operations.  One method postulated to support this requirement is the use of unmanned systems, specifically a UUV sized to enable operations from a submarine torpedo tube, a nominal 21-inch diameter and 240-inch length.  While this has the benefit of clandestine operations and minimizing risk to personnel, it increases the already difficult challenges of mine detection and classification by limiting the allocations (weight, power, volume, heat dissipation, etc.) available to the mine detection and classification sensor system.  Because of the limited allocations on a 21-inch UUV, the sonar solution is required to support a bottom-mounted, conformal implementation and can meet the system requirements in the harsh submarine undersea environments. The sonar solution must be designed to be able to withstand a full impulse launch.  The peak axial acceleration during full impulse launch has been measured to be between 3 and 10g, with an exit velocity between 12 and 24 m/s. 
The purpose of this BAA is to obtain innovative solutions that advance the state of the art of sonar solution for high-resolution bottom mine detection and classification within the limitations imposed by operations onboard a 21-inch diameter, 240-inch long UUV.  High-resolution in this context is defined as an area of 1.5-inch by 1.5 inch with a goal of 1 inch by 1 inch.  Detection and classification ranges of up to 375 yards (threshold) and 500 yards (objective) in a Very Coarse Sand and Muddy Sand Bottom are required to support military needs.  A sonar solution with multiple vertical elements is required to provide range-dependent receive beam narrowing for acoustic multi-path rejection.  The specific developmental goals of this effort are to accomplish one or more of the following:
 a. Develop algorithms that enable detection and classification of bottom mine contacts within the constraints of a 21-inch diameter UUV platform.  These algorithms include beam formation, image formation, motion compensation, and navigation.
b. Develop hardware components, sub-systems, or systems that support detection and classification of bottom mine contacts within the constraints of a 21-inch diameter UUV platform.
c. Develop system solutions (hardware, algorithms, and software) systems that support detection and classification of bottom mine contacts within the constraints of a 21-inch diameter UUV platform.
d. Develop an interface and perform tests with a government 21-inch diameter UUV to validate the sonar system solution support detection and classification of bottom mine contacts
1.  Scope of Requirement: 
Sonar Solutions for High-Resolution Bottom Mine Detection and Classification for Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) Applications is the focus of this BAA, but proposals will be considered for technology developments, demonstrations, and evaluations in the following areas (not prioritized)
a.  Sonar projectors, arrays, transducers
b.  Algorithms supporting beam forming, image forming, vehicle motion compensation, automatic target detection and classification
c.  Miniaturization of systems
d.  Data collection and reduction
e.  Manufacturing processes
f.  Survivability of systems, sub-systems, and components in harsh environments
g.  Test and evaluation of systems
Proposals will be evaluated in part by their contribution to one or more of these areas of interest.  These do not preclude submission in other areas considered by the offeror to have a high probability of interest to the UUV community.
The government is not interested in funding enhancements to proprietary products, architectures or networks that may already exist in the commercial domain.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research is soliciting proposals for development and transition of aircraft nondestructive inspection (NDI) technologies for detection/quantification of heat damage in composites designed to reduce operations and support cost without compromising fleet safety and readiness. The primary area of interest is to inspect/assess incipient damage in composites on aircraft components without removing paint during on-condition or scheduled periodic inspections. 
 
The rapidly increasing inspection hours per flight hour can be ascribed to the detrimental impact of materials damage on aging aircraft structural components, a condition that has been widely recognized for years.  Accordingly, there is a need for portable NDI technology that can be used on an operational aircraft in an uncontrolled environment and  provides reliable and reproducible data that can be used to identify/assess heat damaged materials and  is capable of performing measurements on aircraft in small compartments with limited access.  
 
Application of this device must be as non-intrusive as possible, result in a significant reduction in inspection and processing time over current inspection methods, and have a false alarm rate approaching zero. The device should be easy to handle in normal field conditions. The data collected by this inspection device must enable technicians to interpret information, characterize the problem, and recommend proper maintenance actions.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 05-13, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES
INTRODUCTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, design, and testing that directly supports Advanced Technology Office (ATO).  This includes Robust Networking and Communications, Intelligence Preparation of the Battlesphere (IPB), Information Operations (IO), Information Assurance (IA), Computer Network Operations, Maritime, Special Operations and technologies that provide unconventional advantages over adversaries or potential adversaries. TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS: Research supporting any of MTO's broad mission objectives identified in the Introduction above may be submitted under BAA05-13; however, although this list is not all-inclusive, the following topic areas are of specific interest: 
1) novel approaches to the development, implementation and control of networked weapons systems, 2) novel approaches for the development, implementation and control of heterogeneous networks of human decision makers and human-operated or autonomous sensors and weapons, 3)	novel microprocessor/computing architectures to support secure computing, 4) trustworthy computing in mobile environments, 5) improved explosives with a yield of 3-5 times of TNT, 6)	low-cost military grade encryption mechanisms / devices,

APPROACH: 
This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Procurement Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or other such appropriate award instrument. The Government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.
PROPOSERS: The Government encourages proposals from non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per P.L. 103-337 § 217 and P.L 05-261 § 3136.

<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation No. DTRS57-05-Q-80017 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  The NAICS Code is 336112 and the Small Business size standard is 1,000 employees. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order  and to solicit and negotiate on a competitive basis.  The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement to purchase a Decontamination Trailer for the Libby Asbestos Project.   The Volpe Center is providing environmental engineering and remediation support to Region 8 of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Volpe Center support includes the preparation of technical documents, development of program management plans, environmental studies, and remediation projects.  Currently, the Volpe Center is supporting the EPA’s Libby Asbestos Project.  In particular, the Volpe Center is providing clean-up support for the removal and disposal of asbestos contaminated soil, attic insulation, and indoor dust from residential and commercial properties in Libby. The  asbestos contaminated materials being removed from residential and commercial properties are dumped at a special landfill cell managed by the Volpe Center.  As part of the daily operations at the landfill, workers must wear personal protective equipment (PPE) equal to Level C (i.e., tyvek coveralls and respirators).  Level C PPE also requires all workers to discard their tyvek coveralls and shower out through a three-stage decontamination trailer.  The purpose of this requirement is to purchase a decontamination trailer for the Libby Asbestos Project and to provide the trailer to the Volpe Center contractors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for use on the project.  The Decontamination Trailer must include  the following minimum specifications: NEW or USED trailer; 3 stage (OSHA com pliant) considered for asbestos abatement; 16 feet long; Negative Air Unit with HEPA filtration (minimum of 2” of H20 on clean side); HVAC on clean side; Bench in clean room; 4 lockers in clean room; 2 shower units;  220-volt washer/dryer on dirty side; 100 Amp, 240/120 volt single phase service;  Fluorescent lighting in each stage (clean, shower, dirty); 50 gallon hot water heater or instant hot water pump; Heat traced pipe freeze protection on all exposed plumbing; Non-skid epoxy flooring; 80 gallon grey water holding tank; Insulated shell; DOT approved trailer with electric brakes; Exterior access for clean side, access to showers from both clean and dirty side;  Exterior access for dirty side. Final acceptance of trailer is subject to the onsite Government representative’s inspection i nsuring all specifications are met and the trailer is in the condition specified. The manufacturer MUST contact the Government onsite representative to schedule a delivery day and time.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI) Analytical Services Branch (ASB) seeks to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).  This is not a soliciation announcement.  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis only.  No BPA will be awarded from this annoncement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.  The Government contemplates awarding this requirement as a small-business set-aside.  However, we would  like to review capability statements from interested parties who are both small businesses and large businesses in the event we do not receive sufficient capability statements from small business concerns.  Please idenfy whether or not you are a small business or large business in accordance with  the NAICS Code.  RFQ's are being requested and the associated NAICS code is 541380.  The Statement of Work (SOW) and type of analyses that are required are posted on the following Website: http:www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm under Announcement Heading. The SOW requires the analysis of Chlorinated  Dibenzo-Dioxins and Clorinated Furans (CDDs/CFs) and Chlorinated/PolyChlorinated Biphenyl Congeners (CBs) by Gas Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (GC/HRMS).  The SOW is supplemented by Exhibits A through H:   Exhibit A details general information; B details specific data delivery  requirements and formats; C-CDD lists required reporting levels for the dioxins and furans; C-CB lists required reporting levels for the Chlorinated Biphenyl Congeners; D-CDD details the analytical ethodology required to perform the dioxin/furan analysis; D-CB details the analytical methodology  required to perform the Chlorinated Biphenyl Congeners analysis; E and F detail specific Quality Assurance  requirements; G is a glossary; and H details electronic delivery requirements. The contractor should have in place specific Standard Operation Procedures and a Quality Assurance Plan  containing the requirements listed in SOW supplemental Exhibits E and F within 60 days following any contract award.  A contractor's facility may be subject to audits performed by the Agency at any time after award of this contract to ensure the requirements of Exhibits E and F have been met, as  well as subject to audits by the Agency to ensure adequate performance of the contract is being met. For evaluating a contractor's ability to perform the requirements of the contract, the contractor must submit for this solicitation: 1) a list of references for projects where you have provided  similar services; 2) a copy of the contractor's current Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) for analysis of Chlorinated Dioxins and Furans, and Chlorinated/Poly-Chlorinated Biphenyl Congeners by Gas Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry; 3) QA/QC Plan, as detailed in Section IV of the  SOW; and 4) a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.  These documents will be reviewed and will be determined to be either acceptable or not acceptable in demonstrating the contractor's understanding and ability to perform the SOW.  The  contractor's SOP's and QA/QC Plan may be posted on the web, delivered on CD or e-mailed or delivered by hard copy form. Note that all SOP's and the QA/QC Plan required for submission and evaluation by the Agency may be those that the lab currently uses for work other than that exactly specified in  this SOW; i.e., the contractor does not have to create an SOP that meets the exact requirements of Exhibits E and F, but the contractor is required to submit SOP's and the QA/QC Plan that demonstrates the contractor's ability to perform analysis similar to that detailed in the SOW and supplemental  exhibits.  The Contractor will have 60 days after award of a contract to edit the current Contractor SOP's to reflect the exact requirements of the SOW announced in this solicitation. Information is due by January 31, 2005 at 3:00p.m., Eastern Standard Time.  Information may be submitted via  e-mail to davis.alice@epa.gov or gallion.lynette@epa.gov.  Information may be submitted via facsimile to 202-565-2557.  The Contractor must confirm reciept of fax by calling Alice Davis, Contract Specialist, at 202-564-4461.

Prospective offerors are encouraged to submit initial proposals as early in the fiscal year as possible to maximize the potential for award. The selection of proposals for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds.     
The complete BAA including proposal preparation instructions, technical points of contact for each topic, and evaluation criteria is available at

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>UPDATE, 30 DEC 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) in response to the questions/comments to the DRFP posted 3 Nov 04.  Only documents with changes/updates are posted.  This includes the updated DRFP, Section L and Section M.  Blue change bars highlight changes made.  A document entitled "Industry Questions and Responses, 30 Dec 04" has also been posted.  Questions can be directed to Cheryle Lankford, 937-904-4197, or Capt. Jason Ortiz, 937-904-4609.  UPDATE, 24 NOV 04:  Our e-mail system went down November 12 and was out not fixed until sometime the following week.  As a result, some e-mail  was lost.  If you sent an e-mail responding to the draft RFP during that  time, it may not have been received.  If an e-mail was sent and you did not receive any response from our office advising receipt of the e-mail, please resubmit.  We apologize for any inconvenience. UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.

<SUBJECT>A -- SH2 Domain-Binding Inhibitors Ready For Development
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) collaborator to develop a novel class of macrocyclic Grb2 SH2 domain-binding inhibitors that disrupt the interactions between Grb2 SH2 domains of proteins and proteins with phosphorylated moieties.  As typified by Compound 1 (see http://ttb.nci.nih.gov for structure), these compounds display enhanced binding affinity and are very potent against proliferating cells in cell-based assays. 

Potential Commercial Applications:
•	Oncogenic and hyper-proliferative disorders such as cancer, inflammation, autoimmune disease and allergies

Main Advantages of the Technology:
•	In extracellular assays these macrocyclic peptide mimetics display enhanced Grb2 SH2 domain-binding affinity over previously described SH2 domain-binding inhibitors.
•	Addition to the extracellular media of cell cultures without the use of carrier peptides or membrane permeabalization techniques, results in cellular blockade cytoplasmic association of Grb2 with cognate activated tyrosine kinases.
•	Administration to cultures of cancer cells driven by Grb2-dependent growth factor receptor pathways results in antimitogenic effects at non-cytotoxic concentrations.

Current State of Development:
•	Biological evaluation is limited to extracellular assays and cell culture systems.
•	Animal studies require preparation of larger quantities of inhibitor than are currently available.
•	Synthetic complexity currently limits scale up of compound needed for animal studies. 

Further R&D Required:
•	Improving the synthesis of these compounds 
•	Preparing larger quantities of inhibitor than are currently available
•	Conducting in vivo animal studies to aid in determining clinical efficacy and drug development

Patent Status:
•	 International Patent Application filed on 6/26/2003

Pertinent References:
•	Wei CQ, et al.  J Med Chem. 2003 Jan 16;46(2):244-54.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

HSAR 3052.209-70     PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

         (a) Prohibitions. 
         Section 835 of Public Law 107296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
         (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
         Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
         Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
         Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
         (1)     The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
         (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
         (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
         (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
         (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
         Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
         (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
         (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
         (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
         (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
         (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
         (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
         (d) Special rule for related partnerships.     For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
         (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
         (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
         (i) Warrants; 
         (ii) Options; 
         (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
         (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
         (v) Others similar interests. 
         (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
         (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107296 of November 25, 2002. 
         (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:
              Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)

This combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item and is prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented by additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is RA-1341-05-RP-1020 and is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAR Circular 2001-26.  The NAICS code is 332721, and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The Co-Conical Field Generation System (CFGS) is a set of expanding cones.  This requirement includes the building of a pair of cones, access doors, support structures, and alignment guides to test electromagnetic field Hazard probes.  The smaller (inner) cone shall mount inside the larger (outer) cone with the alignment of a support structure then meet at the narrow tip in a microwave 2.92mm connector (specifically an Anritsu K-104F).  The CFGS system shall guide RF energy from 10 MHz to 40 GHz.  Drawings will be provided to interested parties upon request  These drawings are detailed as five major areas of design:  The Outer Cone, (consisting of 8 major sub assemblies), the Inner cone (consisting of 5 major sub-assemblies), Outer Cone 2 and Door Assemblies, the CFGS Support, and the Inner Cone Support.  These drawings were designed using AutoCAD’s Inventor 8 – to get full usage of design requirements Inventor 8 shall be used to view the design. The use of non-ferrous materials is absolutely critical in the inner surface of the Outer-Cones (Skin parts of Outer Cones 6, 7, 8, and 9) and the outer surfaces of the Inner Cones.  The required blends of aluminum shall be adhered to.  Critical machining issues:  (1) Required Lathe – a vertical lathe with a minimum of 60 inches of travel is required to perform the final finish cut on the outer cone.  Adjacent sections shall be finished together to ensure a smooth transition between sections.  For the final passes the doors shall be mounted in “outer cone 2” and need to be machined so the inner surfaces of the doors are flush with the inner surface of “outer cone 2”.  (2) Inner-Cone - The outer surfaces of the Inner-Cones and mating surfaces between Inner-Cone sections shall conform to the surface finish requirements, parallel restraints and flatness in the drawings.  The lack of a clean, machined finish will incur electro-magnetic losses and cause the system to be unstable.  (3) Outer-Cone - The inner surfaces of the Outer-Cones and mating surfaces between Outer-Cone sections shall conform to the surface finish requirements, parallel restraints and flatness in the drawings.  The lack of a clean, machined finish will incur electro-magnetic losses and cause the system to be unstable.  (4) Outer-Cones 6, 7, 8 and 9 - The inner-surface profile is critical to making a smooth transition between a standard RF-microwave connector and the rest of the CFGS.  The AUTOCAD INVENTOR (*.idw) drawings in cfgs\outter cone\bessel cones have a defined profile that shall be required during the machining process (not identified in the PDF version of the drawings).  This profile shall be delivered in standard Machine-tool, CNC formatting in the distribution of the drawings.  NIST will consult with contractor to determine actual format needed for the file to interface with the contractor’s available CNC equipment.  (5) The mating between sections - The mating between sections of both the Inner and Outer Cone sections is critical.  Specification of the actual diameter of each section is less critical than the smoothness of the critical surfaces between sections.  Matched machining is required between sections to minimize this problem.   Adjoining sections shall be mated together and final finish passes shall be made together so these critical surfaces are smooth.  (6) Doors - The inner surface of the doors shall match the inner surface of the Outer-Cone.  The mating specification on the top and bottom edges of the doors with the inner surface of Outer-Cone shall be adhered to maintain RF performance.  Note:  The dimensional tolerances on all drawings. These shall be adhered to - surface finish and section mating are critical to system performance.  All offers shall contain detailed processes on how the machining will be performed.  Offers shall describe how tolerances will be held (with special notes on the mating of the door sections to “cone 2” and cone section to cone section interfaces).  Machine-tools to be used shall be listed, with accuracy specifications, to verify ability of the offeror to construct the housing assembly.  Details of machining and construction of the skin sections for outer cones 1 through 5 shall be described to determine suitability for use in electromagnetic energy propagation (see design considerations).  Design considerations: 1. Skin construction - The design of the skin sections are left to the contractor.  NIST suggests using the appropriate thickness of aluminum plate then bend the skin sections into rough shape, weld together with upper and lower rings and perform finish machining on the interior surfaces and ring ends.  Other methods will be acceptable to complete the outer cones including machining out of solid stock and casting if tolerances can be held.  Electromagnetic energy propagation will be adversely affected by seams and gaps between the skin sections.  Efforts to minimize voids or gaps in the welding will result in better performance of the system.  Final machining of the outer and inner cone sections shall not expose gaps between the skin sections or voids in the welds.  For illustrative purposes – There is a directory \pdf which contains PDF version of the drawings for initial analysis and review by the offerors it mirrors the directory structure of the actual drawings.   The AUTOCAD INVENTOR drawings (.idw) in the \cfgs directory are the drawings which shall be used as the baseline for determination of compliance with specifications.  The successful offeror should consider purchase of an AUTOCAD INVENTOR license to ensure that they can correctly implement all the drawings (The DRAWINGS ON CD MEDIA WILL BE PROVIDED UPON REQUEST.  PLEASE CONTACT JACKIE WRIGHT AT 303-497-5282 TO BE SENT A CD.

Design Analysis:

1)  Original inventor drawings are on the CD referred to by this RFP – the cfgs directory contain the drawings in inventor format (*.idw)the file cfgs.zip must be unzipped because file names are to long to fit in CD naming conventions.  The pdf directory contains the *.idw drawings in PDF format for easier viewing.  The instructions directory contains the solicitations, clarifications, and instructions needed for building and assembling the system.  The drawing list and locations are located in the file “drawing list.xls” located in the instructions folder there are several folders called “old versions” any *.idw files in these directories should be ignored.
2)The 0.001" tolerances to dimensions are not nearly as critical as the adherence to angle of cones, surface finish, and section mating.  The profile tolerances in outer cones 1-6 are to prevent machining waves (a nice finish but on a wavy surface).  Outer cones 7,8 and 9 shall be held dimensionally stable to the tolerances indicated as well as "inner cone 3" and "inside cone tip". NIST can accept the individual sections of outer cone 1-6 to be slightly longer or shorter as long as the 10 degree angle is met to tolerances, surface finish is met and interface between cones is within tolerance (in other words - we need a long smooth surface on the critical surfaces - if an individual section is longer than specified and an adjoining section is a little short – NIST does not care as long as it is a smooth 10 degree cone with a conforming door).
3)  The angle tolerance of the inner and outer cone can cause the large ends of the cones to be beyond tolerance specification. Angle tolerances and mating surface tolerances take precedence over dimensional tolerances of an individual cone section. 
4)  Outer Cones sections (5,6,7,8) may be bolted together (semi permanently).  NIST assumes that a manufacturer may wish to bolt the cones together (semi-permanently) to ensure a repeatable smooth surface (it cannot be changed by disassembly).  NIST can accept a bolted solution as long as the system can be assembled without risk of damage to the inner cone sections.  The cones will be broken up to facilitate assembly in the Air Force Metrology Lab.  There is a two foot high floor with 4 foot by 4 foot opening in which the cell fits into.  The drawings of the room and floor are on the package CD - If an assembly can be made of the entire system with the floor installed and under the 13'4" crane (as shown in the attached drawing 41H5novotny2 Model w hoist.pdf), it will be acceptable to bolt the cones together.  
Refer to the following files in the instructions directory of the CD:

Rough assembly.avi; ( a movie file of the CFGS being pieced together)41H5novotny Model (1).pdf ;( a top drawing of the cone in the AF LAB)41H5a202 Model (2).pdf; ( a side view of the cone in the lab)41H5novotny2 Model w hoist.pdf; ( a drawing with the hoist to lift the larger pieces)

Outer Cones 3 and Outer Cone 4 may be similarly bolted together if the combined weight does not exceed 400 pounds and system assembly can be performed.

5)  From a microwave standpoint, gold plating the interfacing surfaces of the outer and inner cone will probably improve RF performance - it would be desirable and improve the quality of the offer if it is not cost prohibitive.  This would be a plating of the connecting surfaces between outer cone 2 and outer cone 3 (not the entire cone – just the surfaces between cones).  A further note, completely plating the following parts shall be included in the offer:  Inside cone tip.pdf  (includes inside cone tip and 0.012 tip (prior to insertion into the inside cone tip)) Cone 9.pdf

Nominal plating thickness: 5-10 micro-inches of gold – to ensure long term bonding of the gold to aluminum – a intermediate plating between the gold and aluminum may be considered.

6)  All aluminum pieces (outer and inner cone and door) SHALL be made with a non-ferrous aluminum mix.  NO MATERIAL WITH IRON may be used unless specifically stated (inner cone supports and CFGS support).  The cone tip should be made of RF-connector grade beryllium-copper (as noted).  Conductivity is important and material blends like 6061, 7071 are acceptable.  SPECIFIC ALUMINUM BLENDS FOR ALL CONE PIECES (INNER AND OUTER) SHALL BE OUTLINED IN THE OFFEROR’S PROPOSAL.  NIST can verify acceptability of blends if requested.

7) The parts in “inside cone tip.idw (or inside cone tip.pdf) ” has the largest possibility of damage – there should be 5 pieces of the “inside cone tip assembly” delivered as part of the project. This includes 5 pieces of the inside cone tip joined to 5 pieces of the .012 pin.

8) The beveled end of the .012 pin SHALL NOT be inserted into the “inside cone tip”.  Beveling of the other end, to ease insertion into the “inside cone tip” is acceptable.

Proposals shall clearly specify delivery time.  The Government desires delivery within 150 days.  While delivery within the desired period is not an absolute requirement, proposals offering a delivery longer than 240 days from date of award will not be considered .  Award shall be made to that offeror  whose proposal contains the combination of those factors offering the best overall value to the Government. This shall be determined by comparing differences in the values of technical and management features with differences in cost to the Government.  In making this comparison the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical or management features than with making an award at the lowest overall cost to the Government.  However, the Government shall not make an award at significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical or management features.   Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with the Test Program procedures at FAR 13.500.  Evaluation Factors include: (A) TECHNICAL:  Ability of Machine Shop to Perform Tasks; Ability to provide adequate finishes and tolerances; Ability to assemble and test; and General quality, responsiveness of the offeror’s proposal,  (B) PAST PERFORMANCE and (C) PRICE.  Evaluation factors are listed above in their order of importance.  Technical and past performances, when combined, are significantly more important than price.    Technical proposals shall include identification of compliance with the specifications and drawings.  Offerors shall also provide product information sheet(s) for their materials.  For the evaluation of Past Performance, the offeror shall provide at least three references, along with their respective addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses.  Note that the Government may also contact references other than those identified by the offeror and use the information obtained in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.  In order that the technical proposal may be evaluated strictly on the merit of the offer submitted, no contractual price information shall be included in the technical proposal.  A separate business proposal shall be provided that includes the following: (1) a price proposal and (2) a completed FAR 52.212-3  Offeror’s Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, referencing solicitation number RA1341-05-RP-1020.

<CONTACT>Doris Turner, Purchasing Agent, Phone (303) 497-3872, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email doris.p.turner@noaa.gov
<DESC>The following information is intended to provide additional information on evaluation criteria for the EMCCD Camera System as this is a best value procurement. This also specifies the following requirements. An evaluation of 14 business days for the camera system is required. Warranty of one year for parts and labor and 5 years for the vacuum are required.  Evaluation criteria will include: 1) technical merit (how the product meets or exceeds the specifications), 2) evaluation period, 3) delivery time and 4) warranty.
***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  ion trapping group, Boulder CO requires an electron multiplication charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera which uses an e2v CCD97 back illuminated chip (512x512 pixels) as the sensor element. In order to obtain the low light level capability (essentially photon counting on zero background) required for the ion storage group's work, the camera must cool the CCD chip to below -70 degrees C. Because the camera will be used at the ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths of 313 nm and 280 nm, the back illuminated CCD chip must be coated with a UV sensitive phosphor which provides a quantum efficiency of greater than 30 percent at these wavelengths. In addition, the window in front of the CCD chip which provides a hermetic vacuum seal should consist of a single UV grade fused silica window with a UV anti-reflection coating which gives an overall transmission at 313 nm and 280 nm of greater than 96 percent. This coating must maintain a transmission at all other wavelengths (190 nm -900 nm) of greater than 80 percent. In order to minimize spurious background noise during readout, vertical clock speeds faster than 2 microseconds and a CCD chip readout rate of 10 Megapixels/s or faster is required. Comprehensive software control of the camera is required, including the ability to directly spool data to hard drive.  The camera must have a built-in mechanical shutter for easy recording of dark background images. The delivery time should be less than 90 days ARO.***Technical merit, as well as price, will be considered in selecting a vendor. Technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by fax or by email. You may submit your proposal by email, fax, or by mail. Proposal must be received on or before close of business January 10, 2005.  Please include delivery date, F.O.B. point, business size, and Dun and Bradstreet Number. Vendors must also be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at www.ccr.gov ***This is a small business set aside.  The NAICS code is 334516 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.***The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision;  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items - The government will award a fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer will represent the best value to the government, price and other factors considered;  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - Offerors must include a completed copy of Offeror Representations and Certifications along with the offer;  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.
