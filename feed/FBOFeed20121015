<DESC><p>General Information<br />Solicitation Number: W911QY12R0048 SUAS Services <br />Document type: Pre-solicitation notice / SYNOPSIS<br />Posted date: 15 October 2012<br />NAICS code(s): 611512 - Flight Training with Small Business Administration size standard of $25.5M<br />Small Business Set aside: Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB)</p>
<p>The Natick Contracting Division (NCD) located at 13501 Ingenuity Drive, Suite 200, Orlando, FL 32826 hereby issues the following synopsis W911QY-12-R-0048 under Full and Open competition with exclusion of sources, for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Training, Logistics Support, and Technical / Program Management, unclassified items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subparts 5.102, Part 6.2, 19.202-4 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. <br />The solicitation document will incorporate provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-59. The associated NAICS code is 611512 Flight Training and the small business size standard is $25.5 M. Proposals MUST be good for 360 calendar days after close of proposal period. The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) are applicable, and assigned rating is DO-A1.</p>
<p>A Sources Sought Notice was published in the FedBizOps on 1 March 2012 and more than two small business responded that were judged to be able to meet the requirements and based on this a determination was made to set the effort aside for small businesses. An Industry Day was subsequently held Sep 20, 2012, and combined with Market research, it was determined that there were at least three Small Women Owned Businesses that could meet the requirement; therefore a recommendation was made to set the procurement aside for a Women Owned Small Business Set-Aside. Only qualified offerors may submit their Proposals for the anticipated Solicitation.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice for Training, Logistics Support, and Technical / Program Management for a full spectrum of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) and Parts required to support the SUAS Product Office (PdO) in CONUS and OCONUS, and its domestic and foreign customers. While the current systems fielded are the RQ-11B and the RQ-20A, alternative Medium and Long Range SUA systems may be procured to meet the anticipated future requirements of approximately 300 Medium and approximately 150 Long Range SUA systems with spare/repair parts. Additionally SUAS PdO must maintain the capability to support current and future Warfighter needs for SUAS systems in CONUS and OCONUS. The Army currently has fielded 1,798 RQ-11B systems and 325 RQ-20A systems and has a requirement to sustain and maintain this existing fleet.</p>
<p>The objective of the SUAS Support Program is to support the Warfighter's as well as other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) and Non-Governmental Agencies users' SUAS-related sustainment needs. These needs primarily include SUAS training, maintenance, repairs, and engineering services. Additionally, the SUAS PdO will require various logistics, technical management, and program management services to support its SUAS customers.</p>
<p>Single award, Firm Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is most appropriate to support this effort. The contract Period of Performance (PoP) will be five years with a Base Period of three years, and 2 one-year option periods with CLINS 0001-00XX are applicable to the Base Period, CLINS 1001-10XX will apply to the first option period, and CLINS 2001-20XX will apply to the last option period. The full list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure, including option(s) will be part of the future solicitation. Specific date(s) and place(s) of delivery, acceptance and FOB point will be specified in the individual Delivery orders. The IDIQ contract award is currently scheduled for March 2013, and shall have a cumulative ceiling of $99M for all orders.</p>

<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a sole source contract to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, 2240 W. Ogden Ave., 2nd Floor, Chicago, IL 60612 for the acquisition of the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Three Year Follow-up.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), Size standard 500. The period of performance for this procurement is 24 months. <br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to conduct a review of the medical records of participants enrolled in the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) for Routine Screening for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) for the three years after enrollment to establish and compare the number and type of diagnoses of ambulatory and emergency room visits, and hospitalizations by study group. This project will also establish the number of deaths and type of diagnoses occurring among the RCT of IPV screening participants within a two-year period from time of enrollment.
<p><br />Considering the magnitude and severity of intimate partner violence (IPV), and the potential role health care providers could play in reducing its serious consequences, numerous professional and health care organizations have recommended routine screening of women for IPV in primary care settings. However, various systematic reviews of the literature have not found evidence on which to base this recommendation. This lack of evidence led an expert panel, convened by the CDC in February of 2005, to recommend that a randomized controlled trial be conducted to establish the effectiveness of screening on women's health. As a result, in 2008, CDC contracted with the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research to conduct the first Randomized Controlled Trial of Routine Screening for Intimate Partner Violence. This acquisition builds on the previous RCT. Conducting a three-year follow-up focusing on morbidity and two-year follow-up of mortality will provide stronger evidence for or against the effectiveness of screening of women in primary care settings for IPV.</p>
<p>Hektoen is the administrative agent for research awards to John H. Stroger Hospital (flagship hospital of Cook County Bureau of Health and Hospital Services) investigators. Hektoen obtained informed consent forms from 2,700 participants for the RCT. These informed consent included permission to access participants' medical records and was approved by both CDC IRB and Cook County Bureau of Health and Hospital Services IRB. Therefore, Hektoen Institute for Medical Research is the only one that can meet the project requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that only the researchers appearing on the informed consent approved by the IRBs have permission to access the IPV screening RCT participants' medical records, Hektoen has ample experience in conducting medical record review.</p>
<p>Lastly, providing participant's identifying information to another vendor would violate confidentiality agreements established in the informed consent. Therefore, to conduct a longer follow-up of a screening intervention would require a new RCT which, given the requirements to obtain IRB and OMB approvals and the need for pilot testing procedures, would mean having results approximately six years from now at a cost almost eight times greater than the current cost.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">via email ONLY</span></strong> at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-N-14285 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 7, 2012.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">THIS IS AN RFI FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND NOT A SOLICITATION<br />&nbsp;<br /> <strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) <br />DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY</strong></p>
<p>1.0 Description.</p>
<p>1.1 The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is seeking information concerning existing techniques and technologies that provide the ability to mark items in a manner that authenticates the source of supply via an unalterable, untamperable means. In an effort to protect our warfighters from the possible catastrophic consequences that might result from the use of counterfeit and other nonconforming items in our weapon systems, DLA has mandated the use of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) authentication marking for all future procurements of items falling within Federal Supply Class (FSC) 5962, Electronic Microcircuits. At the present time, Applied DNA Sciences has been identified as the single known source for a botanical DNA marking technology with proven use in authentication marking by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that also has associated processes in place for quality assurance/security and is ready for immediate implementation. DLA is seeking information on alternative approaches for authenticating sources of supply, whether by use of DNA or other marking technologies, for application to FSC 5962 and other FSCs.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for market survey purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. DLA is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject matter of this RFI. The information contained in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. Issuance of this RFI should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. Respondees are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI. Any and all costs associated with submitting a response to this RFI will be solely at the expense of the submitting party. DLA intends to use the information provided in response to this RFI to determine the adequacy of alternative authentication approaches to meet the attributes described in Section 3.0, Requested Information.</p>
<p>2.0 Background.</p>
<p>Counterfeit electronic devices and components are a serious threat to our military service customers. Detecting counterfeits is an expensive process requiring extensive testing. As counterfeiters become more sophisticated, detection becomes more difficult and resource-intensive. An alternative approach is to provide the ability for items to be marked in a manner that authenticates the source of supply.</p>
<p>The ability of custom botanical DNA marks to provide authentication has been successfully demonstrated when item marking is applied by the OEM. DLA is seeking information about alternative techniques, technologies, and capabilities, including other DNA marking technologies, that can provide authentication of items. The information provided must be sufficient for DLA to determine that the authentication provided by the proposed alternative approach can provide assurance of the source of the item. DLA's focus is on technologies that meet or exceed the authentication and other related characteristics known to be available from custom botanical DNA marking.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information.</p>
<p>The four principal attributes of a high-security, anti-counterfeiting item marking technology are:</p>
<p>(1) Inherent physical properties that cannot be replicated;<br />(2) Inability to be physically removed and reattached; <br />(3) Unique identification at the required level of authentication; and <br />(4) A track and trace system to authenticate marked items.</p>
<p>The physical properties provide a unique fingerprint for each item that can be serialized for tracking and tracing. It is important that an anti-counterfeiting technology cannot be removed and reattached, otherwise the technology is relying on the difficulty of removal and reattachment for its security. Serialization and track and trace attributes are characteristics of technology implementation that provide for widespread usage and adequate methodologies for cost-effective, conclusive authentication.</p>
<p>Responses must provide information that will allow DLA to evaluate the feasibility, practicality, repeatability, security, and performance of the proposed authentication marking method and shall address the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to provide a unique marking technique that cannot be replicated and that offers forensic proof of authenticity of the source of supply; <br />&bull; Impact of marking on environmental or personnel safety; <br />&bull; Ability to be integrated into existing production processes; <br />&bull; Ability to mark small items, such as individual microcircuits;<br />&bull; Types of surface finishes to which marking can be applied;<br />&bull; Impact on technical integrity (form, fit, and function) of the item that is marked;<br />&bull; Outcomes of use in other markets for authentication marking; <br />&bull; Ability to defeat transfer or replication;<br />&bull; Confirmation testing conducted by reputable, independent laboratory; <br />&bull; Ability to withstand and remain stable under extreme environmental conditions, such as those experienced in electronic component production and weapon system operating environments; and<br />&bull; Processes in place to ensure marking material is not diverted or misused by manufacturers, distributors, or unrelated third parties.<br />4.0 Responses.</p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>4.2 White papers in Microsoft Word for Office 2010 compatible format are due no later than November 15, 2012. Responses shall be limited to 50 pages for Section 2 and submitted via e-mail to daniel.mclaughlin@dla.mil. All submissions become the property of the Government and will not be returned. Any properly marked and segregated proprietary information submitted will be retained by the Government or, if so requested, destroyed by the Government following its consideration and review. DLA may use a support contractor to assist in the review of submissions, in which case such contractor shall be bound by a non-disclosure agreement with the Government.</p>
<p>4.3 Section 1 of the white paper shall provide administrative information to include the following: Name; mailing address; overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address); phone number; fax number; and name, phone number, and e-mail address of designated point of contact.</p>
<p>4.4 Section 2 of the white paper shall address the issues identified in Section 3 of this RFI.</p>
<p>5.0 Industry Discussions.</p>
<p>DLA representatives may or may not choose to meet with representatives of respondees for further discussions. Such discussions would only be intended to obtain additional information about the potential capability of the technique/technology to meet the requirements set forth in Section 3.0 of the RFI and to discuss any development and/or certification risks.</p>
<p><strong>6.0 Questions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Dan McLaughlin at daniel.mclaughlin@dla.mil. Verbal inquiries will not be accepted. Questions will be answered in writing by email.</strong></p>

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plans to seek proposals from small business firms for participation in Phase I of the Fiscal Year 2013 NOAA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. Phase I of the SBIR program implements the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011, contained in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (P.L. 112-81), which reauthorizes the SBIR/STTR programs for six years. Small businesses are invited to submit research proposals in response to the Request for Proposals. <br /><br />The purpose of Phase I of the SBIR program is for firms to conduct research and development which will allow the Government to determine the scientific or technical merit and feasibility of concepts, ideas and quality of performance as a prerequisite for further Government support which may follow in Phase II of the program. Any organization or individuals receiving awards under Phase I are be eligible to compete for a Phase II award. The following are the NOAA, Research and Development (R&amp;D) topics available for Phase I: Weather-Ready Nation, Climate Adaptation and Mitigation, Healthy Oceans, Resilient Coastal Communities and Economies.<br /><br />The SBIR solicitation will be issued on or about November 15, 2012. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541712. The SBIR solicitation will be available at the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov. Please do not submit questions at this time. After release of the solicitation, it will be the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for any amendments to the solicitation. The Government anticipates making multiple Phase I awards, each with a period of performance of six (6) months and a ceiling price not to exceed $95,000.00.<br /><br />The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered within the SAM.gov website (formerly the Central Contractor Registration [CCR] database). NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in SAM.gov. For additional information and to register in SAM, please access the following web site https://www.sam/gov and select the Help Tab. In order to register in SAM and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A possible source of information for small businesses to use in helping to navigate these systems and learn more about contracting with the government is the Association of Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTAC). In 1985, Congress authorized the Procurement Technical Assistance Program in an effort to help expand the number of businesses capable of participating in the Government Marketplace. The program helps provide matching funds with state and local governments and non-profit organizations to establish these Procurement Technical Assistance Services to provide procurement assistance. They usually provide these service either at low cost or free of charge. You can find your local service center at http://www.aptac-us.org/new/Govt_Contracting/find.php to find out more information.<br /><br />General SBIR - related inquiries may be directed to the NOAA SBIR Program at (301) 713-3565, or SBIR@noaa.gov.

The Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel and equipment required to properly conduct the test and analyze the results. This action is being awarded on a sole source basis to SAC in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements" because they are the designer, developer, and manufacturer of the H-60 helicopter with the detailed knowledge to allow them to perform these changes in a timely and cost effective manner.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command- Picatinny (ACC-Picatinny) is conducting market research for companies capable of integrating a solar reflective pigment into an ecoat or powder coat to be applied to ammunition containers. The goal of the U.S. Army, Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) is to determine if an existing ecoat or powder coat formulation is available or if an in-house development effort is required. The requirements for this effort are as follows:
A. Pigment Characteristics: 	Dye pigment preparation in a aqueous dispersion that contains on average 1-5% 2-amino-2-methylpropanol and 1-5% oley alcohol ethoxylated phosphate ammonium salt with a pH between 7.5 and 9.0. 	The pigment is a Roda Cool product.
B. Requirements: 	The coating shall reduce the increase in temperature above ambient of a sample by 20% (threshold) or 50% (objective). 	The coating shall be a powder coat or e-coat system for application to ammunition containers.
C. Government Drawing: Coatings, High Performance (For Ammunition Containers No.: 12998172).
The contractor is to submit enough detail as to determine technical and schedule feasibility of coating and approach. The contractor shall mark all proprietary information and distinguish it from other information submitted.
The end result for this work is to determine if an existing ecoat is able to retain the solar reflective properties of the pigment and maintain the required performance and characteristics.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W91CRB-08-R-0073 was publicized on the Federal Business Opportunities on 11 Aug 2008 by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory-Human Research Engineering Directorate, Simulation and Training Technology Center (ARL-HRED STTC). This notice calls for white paper submissions in reference to the research interest Topic 6: Training Application Environments, Section 6B: Training Application Environments Medical.<br /><br />OBJECTIVE: The objective of the research effort will be to identify, incorporate, and test existing and emerging sensor technologies into medical simulations in order to objectively measure human performance. The targeted training population is any caregiver who touches or cuts a patient both internally and externally. ARL-HRED STTC is looking for research in this area to augment current training curricula. Specifically:
<p>1. Embedded sensors that can be integrated into simulated tissue and body structures. These sensors will detect touch, piercing, and laceration of the tissues and will track fine motor movements of the trainee within the training space.</p>
<p>2. Objective measures of skills which are cross-walked to terminal learning objectives. These skills should include touch (e.g., pressure, location, duration), piercing (e.g., location, depth, patient outcome/response), laceration (e.g., location, length, depth, and patient outcome/response), and other measurable criteria that may be discovered and directly attributed to success or failure of a procedure.</p>
<p>3. External sensors and instrumentation that minimally impact the realism to the trainee while providing data that can be statistically linked to success or failure of a procedure. These technologies can include instrumented gloves, instrumented medical devices, eye tracking devices; motions capture systems, thermal or laser tracking systems or other sensor systems that may be unknown at this time.</p>
<p>4. Innovative solutions beyond the sensor technologies that can track, record, identify success or failure, or play back trainee performance in a form that facilitates learning.</p>
<p>5. Identification of specific medical examination skills at any level of care that can benefit from this technology and an identification of the forum, course, or exercise where these skills are learned and mastered. A few examples include external abdominal examinations, women's health examinations (e.g., breast and pelvic exams), men's health (e.g., prostate exams), and other internal and external examinations where touch, force, location, and duration are important performance requirements.</p>
<p>6. Identification of specific surgical skills that can benefit from this technology and identification of the forum, course, or exercise where these skills are learned and mastered. An example is a surgical procedure such as crichothyroidotomy where incision location (i.e., based on visible and palpable landmarks), depth, and length are important performance requirements.</p>
<p>The planned method for accomplishing the research in this area is to utilize a phased approach. White papers should be structured so that the technical approach / solution address a Basic Award (Phase 1 / Year 1) and two priced options (Phase II and Phase III). The white paper must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives, and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost. The ROM cost should consist of the total cost plus profit / fee / overhead.</p>
<p>PHASE I. The phase I effort will begin with a rigorous literature review and identification of promising sensor technologies. The initial target is external abdominal examinations of healthy and diseased simulated patients. A task analysis that defines location, force, and duration of touch on the abdomen must be included and performance measures for novice, skilled, and master must be defined. A prototype that can simulate both healthy and diseased states with realistic look, feel, and performance shall be delivered as part of phase I. A usability study shall also be conducted as part of this phase.</p>
<p>Phase I will be a 12-month effort with either a single award at approximately $500,000, or two awards at approximately $250,000 each, at the government's discretion.</p>
<p>PHASE II. Phase II will consist of a validation study on the effectiveness of the prototype as a training tool and on the ability of the sensors to collect objective data that can be quickly and easily converted into human performance measures. A comparative analysis of the prototype against the current method of teaching is required.</p>
<p>At this time, it is anticipated that Phase II will be a 12-month effort with either a single award at approximately $500,000, or two awards at approximately $250,000 each, at the government's discretion.</p>
<p>PHASE III. Based on the results of the phase II evaluations, the program will be further refined. Additional scenarios will be created based upon user feedback. The end result of phase III should be a mature software package, ready to be transitioned.</p>
<p>At this time, it is anticipated that Phase III will be a 12-month effort with a single award at approximately $600,000, or two awards at approximately $300,000 each, subject to budgeting constraints.</p>
<p>Reference Documents are provided at http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=8</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION FOR THIS EFFORT. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION:</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the objectives identified in this announcement may submit a white paper. White Paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible but must be received at electronically no later than 1600 EDT 8 Nov 2012 tojack.norfleet@us.army.mil . No extensions will be granted. White papers must address the objectives for all Phases and shall not exceed 10 pages in length of computerized text at 12-pitch, excluding resumes. Only unclassified white papers will be accepted. All white papers must include Phase II and III as priced options. The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation. A proposal will only be solicited from white papers deemed to best meet the program objectives. White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance:<br />(1) Scientific and Technical Merit: Proposed efforts should create new, or apply existing technology in a new way, that is advantageous to the proposed research topic. The overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal must be clearly identifiable. The technical concept should be clearly defined and developed. Emphasis should be placed on the offeror's technical approach through a comprehensive, logical, orderly, concise, phased plan that indicates major milestones, critical paths, key events, capabilities that can be spun off, demonstration articles, etc. Consideration should be given to the extent which current State-of-the-Art technology is expanded. Offeror should discuss how their concept will be documented, demonstrated, or evaluated, and this discussion should be indicative of the understanding of what is required in this program. <br />(2) Potential Contribution to Military Services Needs and Transition to other Programs: The offeror must adequately address how the proposed solution will meet the goal of the research topic. The proposal must show understanding of the potential approach and make a compelling case for the viability of the proposed effort. The relevance is further indicated by the offeror's understanding of the operating environment of the product or demonstration (current Military or Industrial technical problems/issues, limitations, etc.). The relationships of the proposed effort with other ongoing or anticipated initiatives (military or civilian) that are focused on improving the Medical Modeling and Simulation should be considered. Offeror should recognize and identify potential strategies for transitioning technology within the DoD. Plans on how offeror intends to get developed technology, and information on these developments, to the user community should be considered. <br />(3) Personnel: The qualifications, experience, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principal investigators and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations should be examined and assessed for the proposal objectives.<br />(4) Corporate Capabilities and Facilities: Offerors are required to describe their relevant capabilities and accomplishments. The offeror must have a demonstrated capability to conceptualize, develop theories, identify concept deficiencies, analyze, and develop mature concepts for rapid application/ demonstration. Consider the offeror's history of related work. Also consider any unique facilities or equipment that the offeror possesses.<br />(5) Cost: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be considered as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described. Evaluation should consider the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate and provide accounting of funds, equipment, and personnel, select subprojects, monitor and evaluate the program to achieve the proposed objectives, and respond to contingencies created by unanticipated technical barriers or breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Cost reasonableness and realism will be assessed, but this assessment is of a lower priority than the technical evaluation. White Papers found to be consistent with the requirements of this announcement and deemed to best meet the program objectives may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. To be eligible for award a white paper must be submitted.</p>
<p>Upon completion of white paper evaluations, Offerors will be notified whether or not their white paper was favorably received.

INL's mission is to minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on the United States and its citizens through providing effective foreign assistance and through fostering global cooperation.</p>
<p>INL's Office of Africa and the Middle East (AME) develops and manages criminal justice sector reform programs and contributes to policy formation on civilian security issues in both regions. INL/AME and INL personnel in-country administer all U.S. government assistance to the criminal justice sector within the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS), including its police, justice institutions, and prisons service. The goal of this program is to support nascent South Sudanese institutions to provide security and justice as public services to the population of South Sudan.</p>

The Deputy must be able to work rapidly, responding promptly to multiple demands and juggle constantly changing priorities in a difficult and demanding environment.

<p>The Deputy will exercise independent judgment in developing new and improved approaches to analyze and review INL programs throughout South Sudan, noting new and unforeseen opportunities as circumstances evolve. The Deputy will present these approaches to the Director for approval. <br />1. Serves as acting INL Director when the Director is absent.</p>
<p>2. Other duties, as required.</p>
<p>D. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:</p>
<p>Substantive</p>
<p>3. Advises the INL Director on law enforcement, justice sector, rule of law, and corrections efforts. Identifies potential program efforts and areas of development for future programs that will fulfill INL's goals and objectives.</p>
<p>4. Evaluates and advises the Mission on the performance of South Sudanese agencies and implementing partners operating in conjunction with INL assets and resources to evaluate and recommend the need for future programs.</p>
<p>5. Participates with South Sudanese officials in determining how to best develop institutions that contribute to a more just society, including the police, the judiciary, the corrections system, and civil society.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Potential Repair Vendors for a Protech Pentium 4, 17 inch Panel PC.
This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

The United States Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine if any authorized repair facilities/vendors are available to repair the following item:
Nomenclature: Pentium 4, 17 Inch Panel PC

Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm?

After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the repairs, a solicitation announcement will be published in the CBD. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offers will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. All companies that can meet the specification are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company literature, brochures, or any other information that demonstrates that the specification can be met. Any questions concerning the technical specifications should be directed to Mr John Turmelle at John.F.Turmelle@uscg.mil and any other questions should be directed to Deborah.J.Glass@uscg.mil.

This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offers list or to receive a copy of the solicitation. Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

<DESC>Request for Information M00264-13-RFI-0200<br />Emergency Management Incident Management System (EMIMS)
<p>PURPOSE: This Request for Information (RFI) is an effort to conduct market research for use in formulating an acquisition plan/strategy to obtain a web-enabled emergency management situational awareness solution that provides coordination with civilian response and recovery partners. This requirement shall provide Headquarters Marine Corps, Marine Corps Installations Command (MCICOM), G3 with the ability to standardize emergency management incident coordination and to ensure compliance with Department of Defense (DOD) and USMC policies and satisfy reporting and documentation requirements. Additionally, the application shall support access to important emergency management decision-making information including real-time access to local, regional, and national weather trends, satellite images, mapping information, details of operations and resource status within the USMC and partner civilian jurisdictions, and real-time information sharing. This RFI allows potential contractors to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation demonstrating their corporate capabilities and suggestions that will allow the Government to refine its potential course of action. The RFI effort is intended to assess industry service capabilities and solicit feedback for acquisition planning purposes.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Current USMC emergency management incident management efforts consist of disparate systems supported and funded at the Installation level that are increasingly unable to meet expanding needs and requirements. Existing methods include commercial off the shelf (COTS) web-based software solutions. A uniform approach is needed to address these issues, and allow MCICOM to implement a standardized emergency management incident coordination solution that provides a common incident management capability and supports interoperability with all internal and external emergency management response partners.</p>
<p>CORE OBJECTIVES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED</p>
<p>The draft Performance Work Statement provided with this RFI sets forth the work efforts required for support and enhancements to the Emergency Management Incident Management System (EMIMS). The scope of this effort shall encompass the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Information Assurance<br />&bull; Web-based System Access<br />&bull; Information Sharing<br />&bull; Disaster Recovery<br />&bull; Mapping Capability<br />&bull; Maintenance and Training<br />&bull; Program Management</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI shall not exceed ten (10) pages, including cover letter, discussion and contact information. Subject response must contain: (1) Capability statement sufficient to demonstrate performance acumen directly related to the objectives; (2) Two customer references describing similar work efforts; (3) Commercial published labor categories and rates used by respondents for similar services, if available; and (4) Other material relevant to establishing the core competencies of the firm. Please identify Large/Small Business size, CAGE Code and GSA Schedule contract number if available.</p>
<p>Response is due by 26 October 2012, 3:00 PM. Please submit e-mail responses to Lawrence Rice, Customer Liaison, at: Lawrence.rice@usmc.mil</p>
<p>NOTES: Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation whatsoever on the part of the Government to procure these services or to issue a solicitation. The Marine Corps is neither seeking proposals nor accepting unsolicited proposals, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. See FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. Insert: Information ONLY.</p>

<DESC>Jamaica Bay Science and Resilience Center City of New York and National Park Service Request for Expressions of Interest 
Q&A 	October 10, 2012
Please note that responses are due by 5:00 pm on November 2, 2012. Responses and further questions should be submitted to JamaicaBayRFEI@HappoldConsulting.com. 

Q:  How will this effort be connected to the other projects underway for the Jamaica Bay parklands?  
A: Several other projects are under consideration for the Jamaica Bay parklands, at a similar stage of envisioning as the science center; we are developing ideas, evaluating partners, and considering feasibility. Many of these possible future projects are being assessed through the National Park Service's General Management Plan (GMP) process. Unlike the science and resilience center - which can be established under the existing GMP - many of the other potential projects, such as a wetlands education center, will not proceed until the new GMP is finalized by fall of 2013. The partners selected to develop and operate the science center will be made aware of any opportunities for future collaborations (such as the wetlands education center) and other projects as they move forward. 

Q:  When will the RFP be released?  
A: A decision about an RFP will be made based upon an evaluation of the proposals. A formal RFP may or may not be released, depending on the responses received during the RFEI process.  NPS and the City will evaluate the groups that express interest, and evaluate potential partnerships among respondents.  After responses have been reviewed, NPS and the City will make a decision on whether to issue a formal RFP or engage in more informal conversations with one or more potential partners.  Therefore, we strongly encourage all parties interested in developing and coordinating all or portions of the new center to submit Proposals in response to this RFEI.

Q:  In considering our responses to the RFEI, are you looking for more emphasis on what skills the partners would provide, or what research questions we would prioritize, or how much funding we would bring to the institute?  
A: A wide variety of expertise and resources will be required in the establishment of the new science and resilience center. We will review all submissions against the evaluation criteria, including but not limited to financial support, expertise in appropriate research areas, institutional expertise and management capacity in developing and coordinating all or portions of the new center. The RFEI is purposely open-ended to allow respondents to identify their own strengths, and let us know what they would be able to bring to a potential partnership. 

Q:  Should responses include proposed budgets?  
A:  As noted in the RFEI, responses should include a list of potential funding sources that would support the proposed partnership structure, including assumptions, precedents, and financial comparables as applicable. In addition, these projections should indicate what support, if any, your organization would ask of the public agency partners and what direct support you will be able to provide.

Q: Can you share the list of participants for the September site visit?
A: Yes, the names are provided below as a means of examining potential partnerships in order to establish the new center as a collaborative, world class institution.  We believe it is likely that the entity which ultimately operates the new center will include some combination of different institutions that bring different specializations to the effort.

Q&A 	September 10, 2012

Q:  What types of partnerships are envisioned, and what kind of roles would these partners undertake? 
A: The creation of the new center will ultimately incorporate partners who collectively bring a range of expertise in a variety of complementary areas, including (but not limited to) management and organizational expertise, marine and estuary research capabilities, wetlands ecosystem restoration experience/expertise, and climate change and resilience research and modeling. At the outset we are looking for institutions or groups which have strong track records in one or more of these areas and can work together under the umbrella of the center.  

Q: Can different functions, for example education and community engagement, be split among different parties? 
A: Yes; it is possible that different organizations will undertake different specialties, or multiple organizations could divide these responsibilities based on the expertise and experience of each. As a hypothetical example, a successful team might consist of an institution of higher education that has existing international expertise with marine research in other parts of the world and a local civic organization with an existing network of "citizen scientists" in New York City. Even as different components of the partnership may bring different functional strengths, it is expected that those efforts will be fused into a cohesive and mutually-supportive program. 

Q:  Is it anticipated that partners would bring their own project-specific resources to work at the new center? 
A: One premise of the center is that as the federal and city governments are the sponsoring organizations, both would endeavor to channel and better coordinate their existing research and restoration initiatives via the center. A similar premise would apply to other entities involved in the partnership: that they would see mutual benefit in bringing existing projects and related resources to the center.  Clearly, significant additional resources will be required, and it is expected that partner institutions will be responsible for identifying and securing funding streams to support their research and programming. At this time, no government funding has been identified for this project.  However a number of potential philanthropic donors have expressed interest in the ongoing work around the Bay.   

Q:  Once the partner(s) are selected and an organization is established, how quickly can research activities and other programming begin?  
A: It is anticipated that research activities can begin once a legal contractual relationship exists.   

Q:  Would the new science institute be housed in an existing structure near the Bay, or would a new facility be constructed specifically for the Science and Resilience Center and its partners? 
A:  Existing structures at Floyd Bennett Field and/or Fort Tilden could be rehabilitated for use.  New construction is also a possibility.  

Q&A 	August 10, 2012


 Organizational structure: 
Q: Are you looking for someone to set up logistics and coordinate others' research, or to initiate its own research? 
A: We are looking for all of the above, and are open to a variety of organizational structures.

Q: How much analytical research is expected to be done entirely on site, or, conversely, to what extent could this Center function as a "field" station for an institution whose major labs and highly specialized technical equipment are located elsewhere?
A: We are open to any type of operational structure and invite creative proposals.

Q: Has a scientific advisory board or group been established? 
A: No scientific advisory board has been established. However, we would anticipate exploring the creation of a board with the new partner entity.

Q: Will existing research in the bay continue independently, or be integrated into the work of the new entity? 
A: We make no assumptions as to existing research. While we do not anticipate that all organizations and individuals currently working in the bay will participate in the activities of the center, the goal of the center is to monitor, track and coordinate efforts to the greatest extent possible in order to maximize funding and leverage available opportunities.

Q: In the RFEI, what entities are considered 'public' and 'private' sector? Does 'public' refer to government (City, Federal) only? I work at a 'public' university. I'm thinking, given the examples for partnership structures that we would be considered part of the 'private' sector. (Scripps is connected to a public university, for example.)
A: The public sector refers to the public agencies involved in the creation of the institute. The "private partner" could be, among others, a private or public educational institution or a non-profit organization, as well as individuals, and private or public companies.

1.	Financial: 
Q: What is the budget/funding stream for the center?
A: Funding for the center will likely come from a variety of sources, including grants and philanthropic contributions. We have been approached by funders who are interested in potentially contributing to the establishment and ongoing support of the center, but who do not have the capacity to operate the institution. In addition to any resources provided by a private or non-profit partner, because most research being done today is grant-supported we assume that will continue; however we are exploring other public funding mechanisms.  One premise of the center is its ability to better leverage the significant public and academic expenditures already being made in the basin today. In addition, the NPS is expecting to fund some staff and administrative support for educational activities and community outreach related to the research and science program.

Q: Is there a pre-determined/preferred business model? (long-term grant funding, public-private partnership, other?) 
A: All business models will be considered.

Q: What is being spent on research, monitoring and restoration in Jamaica Bay now by all parties?
A: Since 2002, the Bloomberg Administration has invested over one billion dollars to improve water quality, enhance parklands, and restore natural areas in the Jamaica Bay area. In the next ten years, the City is poised to invest an additional half billion dollars to continue to improve the environmental quality of the Bay. 
In the last five years, the Army Corps of Engineers has managed and provided the majority of funding for a series of wetland restoration projects in Jamaica Bay at Gerritsen Creek in Marine Park and at the salt marsh islands of Elders East and West, Yellow Bar, Black Wall, and Rulers Bar. These projects, totaling nearly $60 million, have been conducted in collaboration with and utilizing funding from the City, NPS, the State Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Port Authority. More specifically, in Jamaica Bay during 2012, about $20 million is being spent on restoration, $6 million is being spent on monitoring, and about $1 million is being spent on research.  
More than 99% of the restoration funding comes from government agencies.  Monitoring is funded about 60% by government agencies, 30% by grants through universities, and 10% from volunteered time by amateurs and professionals.   Research is funded about 30% by government agencies, 65% by grants through universities, and 5% by volunteer professionals.

Q: Will the existing Jamaica Bay Institute budget still be available to support this new center?
A: See the first response in 2 above; this reflects the current NPS Jamaica Bay Institute budget. 

2.	Project Logistics: 
Q: What is the timeline expected for post-RFEI and the establishment of the organization?
A: Timing depends on the nature of responses and interest.

3.	Science and research: 
Q: What are the research projects currently underway in Jamaica Bay? 
A:  A wide range of scientists and academics are conducting research projects in Jamaica Bay. Examples of projects underway include: Sediment nitrogen cycling (Baruch College CUNY); sea level rise (NPS, the NYC Mayor's Office, & Columbia University); eelgrass and oyster experimental restoration (NYCDEP, Cornell Cooperative Extension & NPS); bathymetry of Jamaica Bay (Stony Brook SUNY); and use of ribbed mussels for water quality enhancement, converting algae to biofuel, and building green infrastructure to manage stormwater runoff and reduce combined sewer overflows (NYCDECP).
Monitoring projects presently underway in Jamaica Bay include: Water circulation and retention modeling (NYCDEP); salt marsh restoration monitoring (USACE & NPS); effects of contaminants on fishes and invertebrates (Stony Brook SUNY & College of Staten Island CUNY); triggers of phytoplankton blooms (Stony Brook SUNY); Horseshoe Crab nesting areas (NYSDEC, NPS, & Cornell University); Harbor Herons nest colonies (NYC Audubon & NPS); and Diamondback Terrapins (Hofstra University & NPS).
Information about research projects by NPS, other government agencies, and academic institutions can be found at the Jamaica Bay Research and Management Information Network at: http://nbii-nin.ciesin.columbia.edu/jamaicabay/index.jsp. Additional background materials and presentations on ongoing studies are available at the website for the October 2011 State of the Bay symposium at: http://www.nps.gov/gate/naturescience/stateofthebaysymposium.htm In addition, descriptions of a broad variety of pilot project can be found in the New York City Department of Environmental Protection's Jamaica Bay Watershed Protection Plan Update at: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/jamaica_bay/jbwpp_update_10012010.pdf. 

Q: In particular what are the efforts pertaining to nitrogen reduction? 
A: The City is seeking to reduce the nitrogen discharged into Jamaica Bay by nearly 50% over the next 10 years. In February 2010, the City reached an agreement with State DEC, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and other environmental groups to invest $100 million to install new nitrogen control technologies at certain wastewater treatment plants in Jamaica Bay and another $15 million for marshland restoration projects (some of which has already been invested in the Yellow Bar, Black Wall, and Rulers Bar restoration projects). These investments, made in concert with $95 million the City had already committed for nitrogen control upgrades in Jamaica Bay, will significantly improve the health of one of New York City's most valuable ecological areas. 

Q: Is the whole basin a combined sewer area, and how big is the "sewer shed"? 
A: The Jamaica Bay Watershed is 142 square miles, and includes parts of Kings, Queens, and Nassau Counties. The "sewer shed" is only several percent larger. More than two-thirds of the NPS Jamaica Bay Unit is estuarine water and saltmarshes; the other third is uplands. In the past three centuries, urbanization caused Jamaica Bay to lose more than 90% of its saltmarshes and more than 95% of its freshwater wetlands.
Multiple CSO outfalls flow into Jamaica Bay from the combined sewer areas of Paerdegat Basin, Bergen and Thurston Basins, and Jamaica Bay & Tributaries. For CSO area maps, see PlaNYC (page 67 of http://bit.ly/eFy6Xf) and the NYC Green Infrastructure Plan (starting on page 65 of http://on.nyc.gov/9U8ZnY). The areas directly upland from the Bay, including most of the Rockaway Peninsula, are served by separate sewers or direct discharge stormwater infrastructure.  For a map of the wastewater treatment plant drainage areas, see page 16 of the NYC Green Infrastructure Plan. 

Q: Is the EPA involved in this effort?
A: Yes, EPA has been involved in several of the meetings leading up to the issuance of this RFEI. 

Q: Will there be a citizen-scientist program? 
A: We would actively encourage the formation of such a program. 

Q: Is there an interest in supporting basic, process level studies? 
A: Yes, but particularly if these studies contribute to the core research agenda defined for the center and also provide the basis for further applied science research and solutions.

Q: What are the expected proportions of: i.	Original research ii.	Monitoring of existing conditions iii.	Outreach and education?
A: The institute's initial emphasis is envisioned to be on research and monitoring in the Bay, with less emphasis on education and outreach. No proportions have been set and we invite creative proposals.
                                                                           END OF ANNOUNCEMENT

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Purpose of Amendment--Source Sought revised on 10/15/12 to correct NAICS Code&nbsp;and submission due date/time (4:30 p.m. EST on Monday, October 29, 2012).<br /><br />This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposals. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of commercial and public entities available to provide the NRC with the services described below and to assess their capabilities. The purpose of this request for information is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of conflict of interest (COI). For information on NRC COI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5 (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including small business/small disadvantaged businesses and other Federal entities, are invited to submit a response to the market research questions below. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures, CDs, or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than <strong>4:30 p.m.</strong> <strong>EST, Monday, October 29, 2012</strong>. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. Please send your responses via email to Valerie.Whipple@nrc.gov.
<p>The NRC collects, reviews, analyzes, and maintains data for events involving nuclear material (e.g., non-reactor events such as medical, academic, and industrial events). The NRC also maintains a database (the Nuclear Material Events Database (NMED)) used to capture the information regarding these nuclear material events. Telephonic and written licensee reports of nuclear material events are submitted to NRC under applicable reporting requirements. The event data may also be obtained from inspection reports, investigation reports, and enforcement action documents. In addition to data on nuclear material events for NRC licensees, the data on nuclear material events dating back to 1991 that have occurred in Agreement States, and lost non-Atomic Energy Act (AEA) radioactive material dating back to October 1998, have also been formally included in NMED. The NRC receives approximately 500 to 1,000 new materials events reports and approximately 2,000 to 2,500 event record updates per year from NRC licensees, non-licensees, and Agreement States.</p>
<p>The NRC seeks contractor support to provide technical assistance to the NRC staff in meeting NRC obligations for event collection, review, and analysis for nuclear material and fuel cycle events, and maintenance of NMED. Specifically, some of the primary contract support we are seeking includes 1) collecting, reviewing, and analyzing nuclear material events; 2) providing event review assessment against existing NRC/Agreement State requirements to support NRC's nuclear materials assessment staff; 3) providing technical assistance on specific problems related to nuclear material events; 4) maintaining and upgrading NMED (database. software, and website) and the NMED Agreement State software (local standalone system provided to the State); and 5) developing new procedures and/or modifying existing procedures regarding the use/maintenance of NMED.</p>
<p>NMED consists of a relational database with a password-secure website to store and manage information regarding nuclear material related events. The NMED event data is maintained on a PC in a Microsoft Access database, which is transferred to a Microsoft SQL database that is queried from the website. The website is a Microsoft.Net application (Web Forms, apx) that runs on a Windows Server 2008 server running Microsoft Internet Information Server. The contractor shall comply with all Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) guidance for Level 2 authentication. The facility shall provide general hosting and operational support for a system requiring high integrity, and high availability. All hardware and software shall comply with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2.</p>

<DESC>Update to CEVT RFI&nbsp;&nbsp;15 October 2012<br />The purpose of this RFI amendment is to update Industry on changes being made to the CEVT requirements, and to solicit industries feedback on the four (4) questions asked below. Industry is requested to provide their written response as soon as possible, but NLT Oct 26, 2012. Your written response should be provided to the following:<br />Marialyn Achille-Argaez - m.achilleargaez@us.army.mil<br />Patricia Hyland - patricia.hyland@us.army.mil<br />Kien Le - kien.le@us.army.mil<br />Major Kevin White - kevin.c.white@us.army.mil
<p>The Government now plans on procuring only the Type II simulators (motion based with realistic feedback to the operator). There will be NO Type I (stationary) or Type II Enhanced (with enclosed cab). The requirement for a mobile system will be an option that may be exercised during the delivery of the CEVTs, a maximum number of 32 mobile systems. Based on the fielding schedule of the actual/tactical construction equipment, the customer requires 30 - 50 CEVT (minimum 6 of each of the 5 variants) fielded to Fort Leonard Wood (FLW) for proofing of 12N Program of Instruction (POI) within 6 months of contract award. <br />Some requirements that were identified in the CEVT System Specification PRF-PT-00583 (now called the CEVT System Requirements Document (SRD)) MAY become Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I). P3I items may be incorporated as the initial buy, as options or as Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). <br />These SRD items that MAY become a P3I are as follows: <br />1) Integration of: <br />&bull; SE Core and OneSAF<br />&bull; lighting and weather conditions and effects<br />&bull; weapons effects<br />&bull; soil types/layers/orders<br />&bull; Fort Leonard Wood TA-244 database<br />&bull; AAR stealth view<br />2) Development of:<br />&bull; tactical models and environments<br />&bull; audio communications<br />&bull; a scenario editor<br />&bull; a training utilization report (name of unit trained, number of students trained, STS number and construction equipment variant in use, session elapse time-the running total of time from STS power up to STS power down)<br />&bull; IOS control of all STS (for startup, shutdown and login)<br />&bull; running scenarios and IOS AARs simultaneously.<br />The Government is soliciting industries feedback on the following questions:<br />1. What quantity of CEVTs can your firm deliver within 6 months, and then 12 months after contract award? If this schedule is not feasible, what is?<br />2. Could your firm still meet the delivery schedule outlined above and provide all of the P3I items above? If not, which of the P3I items could be included?<br />3. For those P3I items that cannot be included within the requested delivery schedule, what does your firm consider the best approach for integrating them?<br />4. The Government prefers an open architecture for upgrades and integration. Does your technical approach meet this need? What type of data rights will be provided to the Government? Is your firm willing to provide source code?</p>
**************************************************************<br />The United States Department of the Army, Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager Combined Arms Tactical Trainer Project Manager (PM CATT), Product Manager Ground Combat Tactical Trainer (PM GCTT), requires the design, development, manufacturing, testing, and installation of a Construction Equipment Virtual Trainer which replicates five heavy equipment variants. The trainer consists of three types of simulators - Type I, Type II, and Type II Enhanced. Type I is a stationary simulator used to train start-up/shutdown procedures, control functions, and basic and advanced maneuver operations in both individual and collective tasks. Type II is a motion-based simulator and shall have all of the capabilities and functionality of the Type I. The Type II shall be used to train students on basic and complex tasks in typical and atypical environments. Type II Enhanced provides a full enclosure cab and has all the capabilities and functionality of Type II simulators. The Type II simulators shall have both a stationary and a mobile configuration (the CEVT Mobile System). The trainers shall replicate the form, fit, and function of existing heavy construction equipment currently in use today by the U.S. Army Combat Engineers (Active, Reserves, and National Guard). The proposed period of performance is five years with options exercised. <br /><br />The Construction Equipment Virtual Trainer (CEVT) will train five variants of construction equipment (grader, hydraulic excavator, wheel loader, scraper, and bulldozer). All trainers shall be reconfigurable within one hour from one variant to another variant. The simulators shall enable training in critical tasks that can be repetitively trained in a simulator and tasks that are time consuming, resource constrained, or dangerous to be trained on actual equipment. Of the proposed 592 trainers; if all options are exercised, it is envisioned that 128 shall be mobile trainers consisting of four trainers per mobile system. The models to be simulated are: John Deere Model 240 (Hydraulic Excavator), Caterpillar Model 120M (Grader), Caterpillar Model 924H (Wheel Loader), Caterpillar Model D7R (Dozer), and Caterpillar Model 621G (Scraper). <br /><br />The CEVT requirements include individual and collective training, integration with Government-owned software (Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) and One Semi-Automated Forces (One SAF)), and advanced dynamic terrain capabilities. The CEVT shall allow Soldiers to perform construction tasks that vary from leveling earth, excavating a trench, constructing a stockpile, to loading a haul unit. The CEVT shall provide realistic and challenging training under simulated diverse weather and visibility conditions. Envisioned is a simulator used to train startup/shutdown procedures, control functions, and both basic and advanced maneuver operations in both individual tasks and collective tasks. The CEVT shall be used to train students on basic and complex tasks in typical and atypical environments. The CEVT will be procured in both stationary and mobile system configurations. Fielding will include both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations. <br /><br />Offerors shall maximize an open architecture design for ease of system upgrades, concurrency/technology insertions, software/configuration modifications, and the ability to reprogram interfaces in order to support future changes. Upon completion of the production units, the awardee shall be required to provide a complete technical data package to operate, support, maintain and manufacture the CEVT. <br /><br />The Government Rough Order of Magnitude for this effort ranges from $50M to $80M if all options are exercized. <br /><br />This requirement will be procured competitively under full and open negotiated procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Part 215 guidelines on a best value basis. It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released no later than first quarter fiscal year 2013 with an award contemplated for no later than fourth quarter fiscal year 2013. The instrument being contemplated is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract award. The base period of performance is 24 months. The first 12-month period of performance will end with delivery of one prototype mobile system. Approximately 192 Type II simulators (4 Mobile Systems containing 4 simulators each and 176 Type II simulators) will be delivered within the second 12 months followed by three option years in which an estimated 133 simulators of Type I, Type II, Type II Enhanced, or a mixture of the types will be required each year. The RFP options may be distributed among the types as follows: <br /><br />Option Year 1; 33 Type I, 35 Type II, 8 Type II Mobile System, 33 Type II Enhanced; Option Year 2; 33 Type I, 35 Type II, 8 Type II Mobile System, 33 Type II Enhanced; and Option Year 3; 28 Type I, 30 Type II, 12 Type II Mobile System, 28 Type II Enhanced. <br /><br />Accompanying this Synopsis is the draft Statement of Work and draft Specification for the Construction Equipment Virtual Trainer dated 6 August 2012, and the following reference documents: <br /><br />Dozer D7R TM 5-2410-241-10<br />Grader 120M TM 5-3805-293-10<br />HYEX 240 TM 5-3805-294-10<br />WL 924H TM 5-3805-298-10<br />Scraper 621G TM 5-3805-296-10<br />Performance Evaluation for the HYEX<br />Student Guide 120M Grader<br />Student Guide 621G Scraper<br />Student Guide Dozer<br />Student Guide Scoop Loader<br />Student Guide HYEX<br />Unit Task List Collective 05417R000HCC<br /><br />The Government would like potential offerors and/or interested parties to provide email responses, questions, or comments on the SOW and specification no later than 4:00 P.M.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Notice for Speaker Participation&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISA Enterprise Service Management Framework Consortium<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26-27 November 2012<br /><br /><br /><br />1. INTRODUCTION <br />The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), in support of the Department of Defense (DoD), is seeking participation from commercial companies or integrators that wish to speak at the Department's ESMF Consortium event and have experience in implementing ITSM/ITIL best practices in their environment or can speak to industry trends and practices in Service Management with special emphasis on Service Transition. DISA is interested in having four - six (4-6) speakers from industry to present their experiences in industry (as opposed to government) with ITIL/ITSM adoption efforts.</p>
<p>1.1 OVERVIEW</p>
<p>This event is solely for the exchange of information and knowledge. The speakers in the event will benefit from government exchange with the Defense Department as a whole; however presentation at the event does not provide speakers with any competitive advantage or preferential treatment in future acquisitions related to or resulting from the event. Additionally, the government does not support or endorse any company that attends or presents during the event.</p>
<p>1.2 PURPOSE</p>
<p>The Consortium event is intended to facilitate a learning exchange and public dialogue between industry and the Department of Defense (DoD). <br />To build upon the success of the Consortium the following objectives will be met:<br />&bull; Bring together government and industry professionals to detail the work that's currently being done throughout the DoD regarding ESMF<br />&bull; Highlight industry ESMF implementation best practices and lessons learned <br />&bull; Establish a Community of Practice</p>
<p>The two-day event will consist of industry and government speakers discussing existing DoD problems within the Service Transition domain (e.g., Change Management, Configuration Management, Asset Management,</p>
<p>Service Validation and Testing, Knowledge Management, and Release and Deployment Management)</p>
<p>The Consortium is held biannually at Fort Meade, MD on the DISA campus and will also be available via Defense Connect Online and video teleconferencing.</p>
<p>Government attendees include but are not limited to DISA, each military department, each combatant command, and military agencies. Participants for the most part will be GS-15 and O-6 level with some flag-level speakers and participants.</p>
<p>2. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>2.1 Speaker Experience (limit to two pages)</p>
<p>Speakers are asked to provide a submission that summarizes their experience with ITSM, ITIL, eTOM or other Business Process Management as applied to computing, IT, Telecommunications and Cloud Computing. Experiences should be outside the government realm and should demonstrate use internally to their corporation or large client applications (specifically to organizations that sell or support IT/Telecom services to groups larger than 10,000 with support staff in the hundreds). The government is looking to share experiences with large-scale service providers.</p>
<p>2.2 Speaker Presentation (limit to 15 slides)</p>
<p>Potential speakers should be able to speak to the application of ITSM specifically in the Service Transition Domain (e.g., Change Management, Configuration Management, Asset Management, Service Validation and Testing, Knowledge Management, and Release and Deployment Management). Presentation submissions must respond to one of the following problem statements and clearly state which problem is being addressed:</p>
<p>KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT<br />PS1: Identify approaches or solutions industry uses for Knowledge Management that leverage and enable Service Validation and Testing.</p>
<p>PS2: What points in the testing process does industry require metadata registration, and what are the processes used for updating that metadata?<br />PS3: Define steps necessary to model agency cultural change towards Knowledge Management as the framework required to continue to develop and nurture a successful Knowledge Management program.<br />PS4: Detail how all DoD Knowledge Management activities can be interlinked to roll-out a standardized (Joint) enterprise Knowledge Management Program.<br />PS5: Determine how DISA could leverage other DoD Knowledge Management activities to help alleviate current resource constraints (e.g. Knowledge Management training, rotations, etc).<br />SERVICE VALIDATION AND TESTING<br />PS1: Where in the test process does industry traditionally assess quality and what is industry perspective on importance of the quality assessment?<br />PS2: In advance of testing in an environment, to what extent does industry typically define services (e.g. transport, cross domain, run time), test tools and reporting platforms for types of testing described in the program Test Strategy? <br />PS3: What lessons learned in industry regarding core capabilities and metrics must be considered in the test environment (versus operations)?<br />PS4: What standard practices does industry employ for capacity and scalability testing within your test environment? <br />PS5: What core test measures, results and criteria does industry use to assess your systems during the Service Test and Validation phase?<br />PS6: To what extent do operations access your service and validation testing architecture to verify and validate their ability to run and sustain the capabilities prior to deployment? <br />PS7: What core monitoring capabilities does industry build into the infrastructure to collect information on the status of the service and its performance?<br />RELEASE &amp; DEPLOYMENT MANAGEMENT<br />PS1: What are industry experience using business intelligence tools for decisional dash boarding, test results, configuration audits and operational reporting? <br />CHANGE MANAGEMENT<br />PS1: Currently DISA faces multiple challenges with the integration of the ESM Service Transition functions of Change Management, Configuration Management and Knowledge Management. What are some basic industry best practices to accelerate the capability and maturity of these service management functions into a mature Service Management System?</p>
<p>PS2: Define steps necessary to model and encourage industry cultural change towards Change Management as the framework required to develop and nurture a successful Change Management program.<br />PS3: What measures has industry instituted to implement complete transparency and visibility between all groups for all Change Management processes. Currently, visibility does not exist between DISA's stakeholders and senior management; transparency is required throughout the entire Change Management process.</p>
<p>PS4: Detail industry's efforts to develop and implement a centralized agency-wide tool that will standardize multiple disparate change processes, such as databases, spreadsheets, SharePoint and PowerPoint, and integrate them into a single tool, utility and/or dashboard.</p>
<p>PS5: Define the steps necessary to model industry change submittal and implementation towards the continued development of successful Change Management processes, including procedures, processes, terminology and change criteria, such as risk, priority and impact.</p>
<p>PS6: Detail industry efforts to develop the methods and matrices required to mitigate, reduce and/or prevent downtime or cost over-runs in the deployment, embedment and stand-up of changes within a Change Management environment in your organization.</p>
<p>PS7: Discuss industry efforts to ensure understanding of unintended effects of change, and how you evaluate the risk factors when considering the effects of a service change.</p>
<p>SERVICE ASSET AND CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>PS1: Detail how industry deals with ever changing naming standards for hardware and software products in your asset inventory files.</p>
<p>PS2: Detail industry efforts on how to adopt a risk-based testing approach aimed at reducing risk to the service and the customer's business and integrating testing into the project and service life-cycle.</p>
<p>PS3: Detail industry efforts on how to keep the Configuration Management Database up-to-date and accurate. Discuss automatic update of the CMDB using discovery tools vs. reconciling the discrepancies when the data discovered doesn't match what is in the authorized CMDB.</p>
<p>PS4: Discuss industry activities associated with monitoring process performance. What key performance indicators and metrics should be developed and implemented?</p>
<p>PS5: In light of the convergence of different applications amid the Service Transition, does the Defense Enterprise Service Management Framework (DESMF) also take into consideration an overarching and uniform Data Governance for the data within these systems?</p>
<p>PS6: Contrast the current users Configuration Management constructs against current industry change management concepts in order to assess meeting the customer's needs while inhibiting cost growth.</p>
<p>SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>PS1: As a federal government/DoD agency, DISA is required to follow federal statutes and regulations regarding supplier/contractor relationships. What are some practical approaches to implement a Supplier Chain Risk Management capability to appropriately manage supplier risk?</p>
<p>GENERAL<br />What special considerations affect Service Transition processes in the Joint Information Environment/JIE Technology Synchronization Office (JIE/JTSO) context, where multiple loosely federated sizable enterprises (combatant commands/military services/agencies in this case) with many critical global missions already in progress need to collaborate, coordinate and synchronize on some/most/all of the Service Transition activities? How will/should those special considerations for Service Transition affect Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Operations, and Continual Service Improvement? Are there differences in the near-term and long-term implications? How should we prepare for these impacts?</p>

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) hereby announces its intent to issue a Request for Information (RFI). This Sources Sought notice is not a Request for Proposal/Quote or Bid. This Sources Sought is a market research tool to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources which will be used for planning purposes and to determine if potential sources exist to support a Small Business set-aside requirement. This information is not to be interpreted as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals and no award will be made as a result of this notice. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the Government. The information obtained from submitted responses may be used in development of an acquisition strategy and future solicitation(s). Respondents will not be notified of the results of this source sought notice.
<p><br />GSA is interested in finding glass manufacturers who are capable of producing large pieces of ballistic rated glazing. The glazing is needed to replace existing glazing in blast rated window frames. The windows are of various shapes and sizes, but the primary and largest window requires new glazing in the following size: 2316 mm X 1728 mm. The ballistic rating for the glazing is NIJ Level III-A. GSA has been led to believe that ballistic rated replacement glazing in the maximum size needed can no longer be manufactured with a warranty. This inquiry seeks any information from manufacturers about their capabilities to meet this need. Suggestions will also be accepted and reviewed.</p>
<p><br />Instructions:</p>
<p>All interested parties should submit a response in Microsoft word or PDF Format. All information should be UNCLASSIFIED material only. Any company proprietary information must be marked as such. Information should not exceed 5 single sided 8 1/2 X 11 pages, with one inch margins, and font no smaller than 12 point. Please submit two (2) copies via email of your capability of producing large pieces of ballistic rated glazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please submit responses to General Services Administration, Attn: Naomi Mabins, Contracting Officer, via email @ naomi.mabins@gsa.gov , GSA/NCR, 7th &amp; D Street, S.W. Washington, DC, 20407 no later than 2:00 P.M. (Eastern Standard Time) on Thursday, October 25th, 2012. When submitting your response to this Sources Sought Notice, in the Subject Line of your email please identify the Solicitation Number. Facsimile responses will not be accepted. ALL RESPONSES RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />. <br /><br /><br />Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, construction activities such as new construction, renovation, repairs, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and erosion control, earthwork and operations construction activities as applicable under these MATOCs. The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection. <br /><br />The Fort Worth District intends to award up to five contracts as 8(a) within this pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $15 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3000. In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider - 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening. All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government. <br /><br />After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing. However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors' proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the project-lump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule. The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs. The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for: All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5. <br /><br />This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

BOTH THE SINGLE HULL AND DOUBLE HULL OILERS HAVE IDENTICAL HULL GEOMETRY, PRINCIPAL DIMENSIONS, DECKHOUSES, PROPULSION PLANTS, AND HULL STRUCTURE FORWARD AND AFT OF THE CARGO BLOCK. THE ONLY DIFFERENCES ARE LIGHT SHIP WEIGHT AND LIGHT SHIP WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION (I.E. THE DOUBLE HULLS ARE HEAVIER) AND CARGO BLOCK SUBDIVISION (I.E. THE 187 CLASS HAS A SINGLE HULL AND THE 201 CLASS HAS A DOUBLE HULL).
<p>SINCE DELIVERY, THE PRIMARY MISSION OF THE T-AOS HAS BEEN TO PROVIDE DIESEL FUEL MARINE (DFM) AND JET FUEL (JP-5) TO NAVAL SHIPS AS UNDERWAY REPLENISHMENT SHIPS. THEY ALSO ROUTINELY PROVIDE DRY PALLETIZED CARGO. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF CARGO TRANSFERRED IS DFM AND JP-5, THE NUMBER OF PALLETS TRANSFERRED HAS DOUBLED SINCE 2006. A TYPICAL MISSION LASTS 1 TO 3 WEEKS DURING DEPLOYMENT AND DEPLOYMENTS LAST SIX MONTHS OR MORE. CURRENT PLANS ARE FOR THESE SHIPS TO OPERATE TILL 2040.</p>

IN ADDITION TO IDENTIFYING HIGH STRESS AREAS AND THE FATIGUE LIFE OF SELECTED DETAILS, THE SFA REPORT WILL ALSO IDENTIFY AND RECOMMEND PROACTIVE REPAIRS OF THOSE DETAILS MOST LIKELY TO FAIL IN THE NEXT 28 YEARS (2040). A SEPARATE GRAPHIC INSPECTION GUIDE DOCUMENT WILL ALSO BE PREPARED TO AID IN THE PERIODIC INSPECTIONS BY SHIP'S FORCE AND REGULATORY BODIES.</p>
<p>UNDER THE AWARD CONTRACT, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS:</p>
<p>A. MOTIONS ANALYSIS AND WAVE-INDUCED LOADS: PREPARE A GLOBAL HYDRODYNAMIC HULL MODEL AND CONDUCT A MOTIONS ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE RESPONSE AMPLITUDE OPERATORS (RAOS) OF THE SHIP RESPONSES AND LOAD EFFECTS FOR A RANGE OF WAVE LENGTHS (OR EQUIVALENT FREQUENCIES), SHIP HEADINGS, AND BASE LOAD CONDITIONS.</p>
<p>B. STILLWATER LOADS: CALCULATE THE STILLWATER SHEAR FORCES AND BENDING MOMENTS OVER A STANDARD 20 STATION WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION FOR THE THREE BASE LOAD CONDITIONS AS PART OF HULL LOADINGS IN THE GLOBAL FEA MODEL, AS WELL AS THE LOADING AT THE BOUNDARIES IN LOCAL FINER MESH FEA MODELS. ANY RECOGNIZED GENERAL PURPOSE NAVAL ARCHITECTURE SOFTWARE CODE CAN BE USED.</p>
<p>C. GLOBAL HULL FEA MODEL AND GLOBAL HULL STRESS ANALYSIS: PREPARE A COARSE MESH, GLOBAL HULL FEA MODEL OF THE ENTIRE SHIP AND CONDUCT A STRESS ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE STRESS RAOS, THE NORMALIZED STRESS RESPONSES FOR A RANGE OF UNIT AMPLITUDE SINUSOIDAL WAVES.</p>
<p>D. INTERMEDIATE MESH MODELS AND INTERMEDIATE STRESS ANALYSES: PREPARE TWO INCREASINGLY FINER INTERMEDIATE MESH MODELS AND CONDUCT A STRESS ANALYSES TO DETERMINE STRESS RAOS.</p>
<p>E. LOCAL DETAIL MODELS AND STRESS ANALYSIS: PREPARE THE SIX SELECTED LOCAL MODELS AND CONDUCT A STRESS ANALYSES TO DETERMINE STRESS RAOS AND STRESSES. THE LOCAL MODELS SHALL BE SELECTED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE LOCAL INTERMEDIATE MESH ANALYSIS AND ON THE HISTORICAL BASIS OF KNOWN TANKER DETAILS SUSCEPTIBLE TO FATIGUE DAMAGE.</p>
<p>F. SPECTRAL FATIGUE ANALYSIS: CONDUCT A SPECTRAL FATIGUE ANALYSIS (SFA) ON EACH LOCAL MODEL BASED ON THE STRESS RAOS DETERMINED FOR EVERY ELEMENT IN THE LOCAL MODEL.</p>
<p>G. SPECTRAL FATIGUE ANALYSIS (SFA) REPORT: PREPARE A COMPREHENSIVE SFA REPORT FOR EACH SHIP, PRESENTING THE RESULTS OF TESTS.</p>
<p>H. INSPECTION GUIDE: PREPARE AN INSPECTION GUIDE FOR EACH SHIP FOR USE BY SHIP'S FORCE AND REGULATORY BODY INSPECTORS. THE GUIDE WILL IDENTIFY AREAS OF HIGH STRESS AND THOSE STRUCTURAL DETAILS AND AREAS SUSCEPTIBLE TO FATIGUE FAILURE IN NEED OF PERIODIC, CLOSE UP SURVEY.</p>
